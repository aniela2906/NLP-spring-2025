===== Merle Haggard - Pancho and Lefty =====
Living on the road, my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
And now you wear your skin like iron
And your breath as hard as kerosene
You weren't your momma's only boy
But her favorite one, it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit boy
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match, you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
But that's the way it goes
All the Federales say
They could've had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down South
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows
We only let him slip away
The poets tell how Pancho fell
And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends, we're told
Pancho needs your prayers, it's true
But save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growing old
(All the Federales say)
(We could've had him any day)
They only let him go so long
A few gray Federales say

===== Merle Haggard - Fightin Side Of Me =====
I hear people talking bad
About the way they have to live here in this country
Harping on the wars we fight
And griping 'bout the way things ought to be
And I don't mind them switching sides
And standing up for things they believe in
But when they're running down our country, man
They're walking on the fighting side of me
Running down a way of life
Our fighting men have fought and died to keep
If you don't love it, leave it
Let this song that I'm singing be a warning
When you're running down our country, hoss
You're walking on the fighting side of me
I read about some squirrely guy
Who claims that he just don't believe in fighting
And I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on being free
They love our milk and honey
But they preach about some other way of living
And when they're running down our country, man
When you're running down our country, man

===== Merle Haggard - I Think I'll Just Stay Here And Drink =====
I could be holding you tonight
I could quit doing wrong, start doing right
You don't care about what I think
Think I'll just stay here and drink
Hey, putting you down won't square the deal
At least you'll know the way I feel
Hey, take all the money in the bank
Hey, listen close and you can hear
That loud jukebox playing in my ear
Ain't no woman gonna change the way I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink
Yessir
Here comes that piano
Hey, hurtin' me now don't mean a thing
Since love ain't here it don't feel the pain
My mind ain't nothing but a total blank
Yeah
We're gone

===== Merle Haggard - Mama Tried =====
The first thing I remember knowin'
Was a lonesome whistle blowin'
And a young'n's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
And no one could change my mind, but mama tried
A one and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
My mama seemed to know what lay in store
Despite all my Sunday learnin'
Towards the bad I kept on turnin'
'Til mama couldn't hold me anymore
And I turned twenty-one in prison, doing life without parole
No one could steer me right, but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame, 'cause mama tried
Dear old daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right, but I refused

===== Merle Haggard - Okie From Muskogee =====
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take our trips on LSD
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street
'Cause we like living right, and being free
We don't make a party out of loving
But we like holding hands and pitching woo
We don't let our hair go long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do
And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen
And football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean
(In Muskogee Oklahoma USA)

===== Merle Haggard - Big City =====
I'm tired of this dirty old city
Entirely too much work and never enough play
And I'm tired of these dirty old sidewalks
Think I'll walk off my steady job today
Turn me loose, set me free
Somewhere in the middle of Montana
And give me all I've got coming to me
And keep your retirement
And your so-called social security
Big City, turn me loose and set me free
Yeah
Been working every day since I was twenty
Haven't got a thing to show for anything I've done
There's folks who never work and they've got plenty
Think it's time some guys like me had some fun
So
Hey, Big City, turn me loose and set me free

===== Merle Haggard - Are the Good Times Really Over (I Wish a Buck Was Still Silver) =====
I wish a buck was still silver
It was back when the country was strong
Back before Elvis
And before the Vietnam War came along
Before The Beatles and "Yesterday"
When a man could still work, and still would
Is the best of the free life behind us now?
And are the good times really over for good?
And are we rolling downhill
Like a snowball headed for hell?
With no kind of chance for
The flag or the Liberty Bell
I wish a Ford and a Chevy
Would still last ten years, like they should
I wish coke was still cola
And a joint was a bad place to be
And it was back before Nixon
Lied to us all on TV
Before microwave ovens
When a girl could still cook, and still would
Are we rolling downhill
Stop rolling downhill
Like a snowball headed for hell
Stand up for the flag
And let's all ring the Liberty Bell
Let's make a Ford and a Chevy
That'll still last ten years, like they should
'Cause the best of the free life is still yet to come
And the good times ain't over for good

===== Merle Haggard - I Think I'll Just Stay Here And Drink =====
I could be holding you tonight
I could quit doing wrong, start doing right
You don't care about what I think
Think I'll just stay here and drink
Hey, putting you down won't square the deal
At least you'll know the way I feel
Hey, take all the money in the bank
Hey, listen close and you can hear
That loud jukebox playing in my ear
Ain't no woman gonna change the way I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink
Yessir
Here comes that piano
Hey, hurtin' me now don't mean a thing
Since love ain't here it don't feel the pain
My mind ain't nothing but a total blank
Yeah
We're gone

===== Merle Haggard - The Bottle Let Me Down =====
Each night I leave the bar room when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight your memory found me much too sober
I couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind
Tonight the bottle let me down
And let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turning every day
But the wine don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurting in an old familiar way

===== Merle Haggard - Okie From Muskogee =====
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take our trips on LSD
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street
'Cause we like living right, and being free
We don't make a party out of loving
But we like holding hands and pitching woo
We don't let our hair go long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do
And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen
And football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean
(In Muskogee Oklahoma USA)

===== Merle Haggard - Ramblin' Fever =====
My hat don't hang on the same nail too long
My ears can't stand to hear the same old song
And I don't leave the highway long enough
To bog down in the mud
'Cause I've got ramblin' fever in my blood
I caught this ramblin' fever long ago
When I first heard a lonesome whistle blow
If someone said I ever gave a damn
They damn sure told you wrong
I've had ramblin' fever all along
Ramblin' fever
The kind that can't be measured by degrees
There ain't no kind of cure for my disease
There's times I'd like to bed down on a sofa
And let some pretty lady rub my back
And spend the early morning drinking coffee
And talkin' about when I'll be coming back
'Cause I don't let no woman tie me down
And I'll never get too old to get around
I want to die along the highway and rot away
Like some old highline pole
And rest this ramblin' fever in my soul
Ooh, yeah

===== Merle Haggard - That's the Way Love Goes =====
I've been throwing horseshoes over my left shoulder
I've spent most all my life searching for that four-leaf clover
Yet you ran with me, chasing my rainbows
Honey, I love you too and that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes, babe
That's the music God made
For all the world to sing
It's never old, it grows
Losing makes me sorry
You say "Honey, now don't worry"
Don't you know I love you too?
And that's the way love goes
You say "Honey, don't worry"

===== Merle Haggard - Working Man Blues =====
It's a big job just gettin' by with nine kids and a wife
But I been a workin' man dang near all my life
I'll be working long as my two hands are fit to use
I'll drink my beer in a tavern
Sing a little bit of these working man blues
I keep my nose on the grindstone, I work hard every day
I might get a little tired on the weekend after I draw my pay
But I'll go back workin, come Monday morning I'm right back with the crew
I'll drink a little beer that evening
Sometimes I think about leaving, do a little bummin' around
I wanna throw my bills out the window catch a train to another town
But I go back working I gotta buy my kids a brand new pair of shoes
Yeah I drink a little beer in a tavern
Cry a little bit of these working man blues
Hey hey, the working man, the working man like me
I ain't never been on welfare, that's one place I won't be
'Cause I'll be working long as my two hands are fit to use
Always late with your kisses
Won't you come to my arms, sweet darlin', and stay
Why, oh why do you want to do me this way?
How long do you think I can wait
When you know you're always late

===== Merle Haggard - My Favorite Memory =====
The first time we met
Is a favorite memory of mine
They say time changes all it pertains to
But your memory is stronger than time
I guess everything does change
Except what you choose to recall
There's a million good daydreams to dream on
But baby, you are my favorite memory of all
Like the night we made love in the hallway
Slept all night long on the floor
Like the winter we spent on Lake Shasta
Alone and closer than ever before
And I remember that London vacation
It was you who made the whole thing a ball
There's a million good times I could dwell on

===== Merle Haggard - I'm A White Boy =====
Some folks call me a ramblin’ man
I do a lotta thumbin’ and a kickin’ cans
And it wouldn’t do an ounce of good to call my name
Cause daddy’s name wadn’t Willy Woodrow
And I wadn’t born and raised in no ghetto
Just a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
Well I’m out to find me a wealthy woman
And a line of work that don’t take no diploma
I ain’t got much to lose but a lot to gain
Well some might call me a goodtime fella
I ain’t black and I ain’t yella
Yeah I don’t want no handout livin’
Don’t want any part of anything they’re givin’
I’m proud and white and I’ve got a song to sing
Well I’ve said a few things and I’ll admit it
If you wanna get ahead you gotta hump and get it
I’m a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
Hump and git it now
Yeah I’m a small town boy been around a little
I like guitars and I like a fiddle
And that’s the kinda soul it takes to fan my flame
Well I’m a blue eyed Billy kinda frail and ruddy
So I’ll have to work to be somebody
I don’t want no handout livin’
And don’t want any part of anything they’re givin’

===== Merle Haggard - If We Make It Through December =====
If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine
Got laid off down at the factory
And their timing is not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
I wanted Christmas to be right for Daddy's girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
But my little girl don't understand
Why Daddy can't afford no Christmas gear

===== Merle Haggard - It's All Going to Pot =====
Well, it’s all going to pot
Whether we like it or not
Best  I can tell
The world’s gone to hell
And we’re sure gonna miss it a lot
All of the whiskey in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Just couldn't hit the spot
I gotta hundred dollar bill, friend
You can keep your pills
Cause it’s all going to pot
That cackle-bobble-head-in-a-box
Must think I'm dumb as a rock
Readin' daily news
While I'm kickin' off my shoes
And it's scarin' me outta my socks
The Red Headed Stranger I'm not
But buddy, let me tell you what
If ya ask ol' Will
He'll tell ya here's the deal
Friends, it's all goin' to pot
Best I can tell
And we’re all gonna miss it a lot
All the whiskey in Lynchburg, Tennessee
I gotta hundred dollar bill
You can keep your pills, friend
It’s all goin' to pot
Well I thought I had found me a girl
Sweetest little thing in the world
But all my jokes went up in smoke
When I caught her makin' eyes at Merle
He said, sweet little honey
With her eye on your money
Is gonna take every penny you got
I said she's never gonna get it
Cause I've already spent it
Merle, it's all goin' to pot
It’s all going to pot
Cause it’s all goin' to pot

===== Merle Haggard - Swinging Doors =====
This old smoke-filled bar is something I'm not used to
But I gave up my home to see you satisfied
And I just called to let you know where I'll be living
It's not much, but I feel welcome here inside
And I've got swinging doors, a jukebox, and a barstool
And my new home has a flashing neon sign
Stop by and see me anytime you want to
'Cause I'm always here at home till closing time
I've got everything I need to drive me crazy
And I've got everything it takes to lose my mind
And in here the atmosphere's just right for heartaches
And thanks to you I'm always here till closing time
I've got swinging doors, a jukebox, and a barstool
I'm always here at home till closing time

===== Merle Haggard - Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Star =====
Twinkle, twinkle lucky star
Can you send me luck from where you are?
Can you make a rainbow shine that far?
Can you really make a wish come true?
And do you shine on just a chosen few?
Is it over? Have I gone too far?
Like two ships on the ocean, we drifted apart
And you found an island at sea
I'm still adrift with this pain in my heart
Won't you send her sweet love back to me?
Can you send me love from where you are?

===== Merle Haggard - Rainbow Stew =====
There's a big brown cloud in the city
And the countryside's a sin
And the price of life is too high to give up
Got to come down again
When the world wide war is over and done
And the dream of peace comes true
We'll all be drinking that free bubble up
And eating that rainbow stew
When they find out how to burn water
And the gasoline car is gone
When an airplane flies without any fuel
And sunlight heats our home
One of these days when the air clears up
And the sun come shining through
Eating rainbow stew with a silver spoon
Underneath that sky of blue
You don't have to get high to be happy
Just think about what's in store
When people start doing what they oughta to be doing
They won't be booing no more
When a president goes through the white house doors
And does what he says he'll do

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Family Tradition =====
Country music singers have always been a real close family
But lately some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me
I guess it's because I kind of changed my direction
Lord, I guess I went and broke their family tradition
They get on me, they wanna know
"Hank, why do you drink, Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?"
Over and over, everybody made my prediction
So, if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition
I am very proud of my daddy's name
Although his kind of music and mine ain't exactly the same
Stop and think it over, put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long, it's a family tradition
So don't ask me
If I'm down in a honky-tonk and some ol' slick's trying to give me friction
I say, "Leave me alone, I'm singing all night long, it's a family tradition"
Lordy, I have loved some ladies, and I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 1973
When that doctor asked me, "Son, how'd you get in this condition?"
I said, "A-hey, Sawbones, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition"
Stop and think it over, try to put yourself in my unique position

===== Hank Williams Jr. - A Country Boy Can Survive =====
The preacher man says it's the end of time
And the Mississippi River, she's a-goin' dry
The interest is up and the stock market's down
And you only get mugged if you go downtown
I live back in the woods, you see
My woman and the kids and the dogs and me
I got a shotgun, a rifle and a 4-wheel drive
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive
I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk 'til dawn
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too
Ain't too many things these old boys can't do
We grow good ol' tomatoes and homemade wine
Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
'Cause we're them old boys raised on shotguns
We say grace, and we say ma'am
If you ain't into that, we don't give a damn
We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies
And we can skin a buck, we can run a trotline
I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me by my name, just "Hillbilly"
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a businessman
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights
And I'd send him some homemade wine
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For 43 dollars, my friend lost his life
I'd love to spit some Beech-Nut in that dude's eyes
Then shoot him with my old .45
'Cause a country boy can survive, country folks can survive
'Cause you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
We're from north California and south Alabam'
And little towns all around this land
And we can skin a buck, and run a trotline
A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Dinosaur =====
Hey man, them ain't high heel sneakers
And they sure don't look like cowboy boots
And that ain't rock and roll you're playin'
And it sure ain't country or rhythm and blues
You're singin' a song about makin' love to your drummer
Well, gay guitar pickers don't turn me on
And we don't all get into Donna Summer
Do you happen to know any ol' Hank Williams songs?
'Cause you see I'm a dinosaur
I should have died out a long time before
Have pity on a dinosaur
Hand me my hat, excuse me man, but where's the door?
Used to be I had a lot of fun in this old hangout
We'd get stoned at the jukebox and stay out of fights
Now and then, light a little smoke in the truck out back
Then a little old Jim Beam and we'd get right
And you know these flashin' lights sure make me dizzy
And this disco's very strange to my ears
It looks like they've turned the Longhorn into a spaceship
And I'll be leavin' just as soon as I finish this beer
Should have died out a long time before
There's a whole lot of dinosaurs
So give us our hats, excuse me man, but where's the door?
Get us our hats
Excuse me, man
But where's the door?

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Whiskey Bent And Hell Bound =====
I've got a good woman at home who thinks I do no wrong
But sometimes, Lord, she just ain't always around
And you know that's when I fall, now I can't help myself at all
And I get whiskey bent and hell bound
Play me some songs about a ramblin' man
Put a cold one in my hand
'Cause you know I love to hear those guitar sounds
Don't you play "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"
'Cause I'll get all balled up inside
And I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound
Sure enough about closin' time, 'bout stoned out of my mind
And I end up with some honky tonk special I found
Just as sure as the morning sun comes, thinking of my sweet girl at home
And I need to get whiskey bent and hell bound
Play me the songs about ramblin' man
Put old Jim Beam in my hand
'Cause you know I still love to get drunk and hear country sounds
But don't play "Your Cheatin' Heart"
'Cause that'll tear me all apart
I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound
Yeah, old Hank's songs always make me feel low down

===== Hank Williams Jr. - If Heaven Ain't A Lot Like Dixie =====
If heaven ain't a lot like Dixie
I don't want to go
I'd just as soon stay home
I was one of the chosen few to be born in Alabam'
I'm just like my daddy's son, I'm proud of who I am
I went through a lot of good women
And shook old Jim Beam's hand
If I never see the pearly gates
I've walked through the promised land
If they don't have a Grand Ole Opry
Like they do in Tennessee
Just send me to hell or New York City
It would be about the same to me
I've got wild honey trees and crazy little weeds
Growing around my shack
These dusty roads ain't streets of gold
But I'm a happy right where I'm at
All these pretty little southern belles are a country boy's dream
They ain't got wings or halos, but they sure lookin' good to me
Like they do down in Tennessee
If they ain't got a Grand Ole Opry

===== Hank Williams Jr. - All My Rowdy Friends (Have Settled Down) =====
All my rowdy friends have settled down
And they seem to be more into laid back songs
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
Everybody just wants to go back home
I, myself, have seen my wilder days
And I have seen my name at the top of the page
But I need to find a friend just to run around
But nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a "Lost Highway"
And old George Jones, I'm glad to see, is finally getting straight
And Waylon's staying home and loving Jessi more these days
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
Ow!
And the hangovers hurt more than they used to
And corn bread and ice teas took the place of pills and 90-proof
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do
And nobody wants to get high on the town
Yeah, I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a "Lost Highway"
And Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68
And Kris, he is a movie star and he's moved off to L.A..
Yeah, me and my rowdy friends done rowdied on down

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Weatherman =====
Mr. Weatherman
What is your forecast?
I need a major change
I can't stand no more rain
Everything's been goin' wrong
Please, tell me it's something in the ozone
Or is the atmospheric pressure just too strong?
I can't ride out one more storm
'Cause I've had too many highs and too many lows
Too many storms and tornadoes
I need some blue skies and sunshine
I need a good forecast tonight
I need a good outlook tonight
Hope your weekend forecast is bright
Hope you got me on your weather eye

===== Hank Williams Jr. - All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight =====
I got ketchup on my blue jeans, I just burned my hand
Lord, it's hard to be a bachelor man
I've got girls that can cook, I've got girls that can clean
I've got girls that can do anything in between
I've got to get ready, make everything right
'Cause all my rowdy friends are coming over tonight
Do you want to drink? Hey, do you want to party?
Hey, honey, this is ol' Hank ready to get the thing started
We cooked a pig in the ground, we got some beer on ice
And all my rowdy friends are coming over tonight
Now my party pad is out in the woods
It's a long, long way from here to Hollywood
But I got some natural queens out on the floor
And ole Miss Mississippi just walked through the door
I got a little whirlpool just made for ten
And you can jump out, and you can jump in
You can do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, don't you step on my cowboy boots
Hey, honey, this is ol' Hank ready to get the summer started
Hey, hey, this is rockin' Randall Hank
Ready to get the summertime started
That's right
Come on in

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Outlaw Women =====
She works in a bank and she works in a store
And she don't go for that old stuff anymore
She likes to get high and listen to the band
She likes to make love to her kind of man
These outlaw women, first of their kind
Outlaw women, they got you right on time
Outlaw women don't need any guns
Outlaw women, just out of fun
In a way she's a lot like me
She don't give a damn 'bout society
Might be little rich girl, she might be poor
Might be a married woman that needs a little more
She's a outlaw woman, first of the kind
These outlaw women, ridin' high in '79
These outlaw women, don't need any guns
These outlaw women, just out of fun

===== Hank Williams Jr. - O.D.'d In Denver =====
We started the tour out in Denver Colorado
I made the first one but I did not make the second show
'Cause I met this girl there that brought about quite a big change
But I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
I guess you could say that my love life would not up to par
Too many nights alone had left some permanent scars
She told me she'd love me and I told her I'd do the same
Then I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
I brought it on myself and I guess that I shouldn't complain
Doc said, "Son, you can't do anymore of that cocaine"
But she made me higher than all of those expensive things
But I OD'd in Denver and wish I could remember her name
I turned to other things tryin' to make my daydreams real
But they don't take the place of the woman's face and her feel
She treated me nice and I'd like to find her again
Kinda overdid it in Denver and I just can't remember her name

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Country State Of Mind =====
That hot old summer sun make you beg for your next breath
So you best be on the creek bank, laid in the shade
Chewin' on a hickory twig, pass that bottle, I'll have me a swig
I ain't got a lot, but I think I got it made in the shade
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind
Catchin' these fish like they're goin' out of style, drinkin' this homemade wine
Hey, if the sun don't come up tomorrow, people, I've had a good time
I bet the old man's in the kitchen, he's got my kind of music on his radio
Oh, drinkin' his beer and dialin' up the request lines
Mama and old Aunt Joan probably in the dinin' room tryin' to use the phone
Me, I'm thinkin' about that girl and later tonight
Hey, I'm catchin' these fish like they're goin' out of style, I'm drinkin' this homemade wine
And if the sun don't come up tomorrow, people, I've had a good time
You know, the rednecks and the preppies, they're in their discos and honky-tonks
Somewhere between raisin' hell and amazin' grace
Lord, I know just how they feel, you gotta get out and kick up your heels
And ain't it great to be livin' in the U.S.A
Me, I'm laid up here in a country state of mind
Catchin' these fish like they're goin' out of style, drinkin' this homemade wine, all the time
If the sun don't shine tomorrow, people, I have had a good time
Yodel-ay-ee-oh, del-ay-ee-oh, del-ay

===== Hank Williams Jr. - The Conversation =====
Hank, let's talk about your daddy
Tell me how your mama loved that man
Well just break out a bottle, Hoss
I'll tell you about the driftin' cowboy band
We won't talk about the habits
Just the music and the man
That's all
Now Hank, if you just got to tell me
Did your daddy really write all them songs, did he?
That don't deserve no answer, hossL
Et's light up and just move along
Do you think he wrote 'em about your mama
Or about the man who done her wrong?
You know that
Well back then they called him crazy
Nowadays they call him a saint
Now the ones that called him crazy
Are still ridin' on his name
Well if he was here right now, Bocephus
Would he think that we were right, do you think he might?
Don't you know he would, Watasha
Be right by our side
If we left for a show in Provo
He'd be the first one on the bus and ready to ride
"I just wanna go hoss!"
Wherever he is I hope he's happy
And I hope he's doin' well, yes I do
He is, 'cause he's got one arm around my mama now
How he sure did love Miss Audrey and raisin' hell
I won't ask you no more questions
To the stories only Hank could tell
Most folks don't know that they fired him from the Opry
And that caused him the greatest pain
I loved to tell you about lovesick
And how Miss Audrey loved that man
You know I've always loved to listen
To the stories about that driftin' cowboy band, yes man
You know when we get right down to it
Still the most wanted outlaws in the land

===== Hank Williams Jr. - The American Way =====
If you fly in from Birmingham
You'll get the last gate
If you blew in from Boston
No, you sure won't have to wait
And I'm learnin' a little more every day
Aww, 'bout the power of the dollar
And the people with white collars
And the good old American way
I've noticed I don't get much help
When they see my blue jeans
Some slick with a suit walks up
"Oh, can I help you, please?"
Yes, I'm learnin' as I gain a little age
Some high society lady says
"Is your horse outside?"
"No, ma'am he's between my legs
But you're too fat to ride!"
And you're learnin' a little more about my ways
And what I think about your dollar
And your white collar
And your good old American way
If you don't like my Nudie boots
I'm sorry about that
Don't make fun of my hat too
Or you might get knocked flat
And you'll learn some more if you ever pass down our way
Aww, 'bout the folks without the dollars
And without white collars
Hell, they are the American way

===== Hank Williams Jr. - There's A Tear In My Beer =====
There's a tear in my beer
'Cause I'm crying for you, dear
You are on my lonely mind
Into these last nine beers
I have shed a million tears
I'm going to keep drinking until I'm petrified
And then maybe these tears will leave my eyes
Last night I walked the floor
And the night before
It seems my life is through
And I'm so doggone blue
I'm going to keep drinking til I can't move a toe
And then maybe my heart won't hurt me so
'Cause I'm crying for you dear
Lord, I've tried and I've tried
But my tears I can't hide
All these blues that I've found
Have really got me down
I'm going to keep drinking til I can't even think
Cause in the last week I ain't slept a wink

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Born To Boogie =====
Well, my mama met my daddy down in Alabam'
They tied the knot so here I am
Born on the bayou on the Texas line
Loved in Louisiana and raised on Jambalaya
Now before I could walk, I had a guitar in my hand
By the time I could talk, I had my own band
I went on the road when I was eight years old
When I turned fifteen, I was stealing the show
Money to burn and the girls were pretty
It didn't take me long to learn that I was born to boogie
When I was eighteen, I went to Hollywood
I met Elvis and Marilyn and Johnny B. Goode
Got my guitar painted and some California sun
A red Cadillac, having too much fun
Now we were playing them halls and jamming then
And we moved it on over to MGM
They said, "This is the boy we've been telling you about"
He lit a cigar and stuck his hand out
He said, "Son, have we got a deal for you
I'm gonna make you a star
Give you fifty thousand too"
I told him, "My Momma didn't raise no fool"
"I'll take your money, I'll make your movie
I'll tell you right now I was born to boogie"
Well my name is Bocephus, I drink whiskey by the gallon
And I never back down and I love a good challenge
What I do now is what I did then
I like to get down with all my rowdy friends
Now I can be sweet and I can be mean
I still got my hat and I still wear my jeans
My shades are chrome, my guitar is steel
If you think I won't then believe me I will
Get down on you, baby, 'cause I ain't no rookie
I was put here to party and I was born to boogie

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Dixie On My Mind =====
All the stations up here, they don't sign off with "Dixie"
The way they did in sweet home Alabam'
And the people here don't sip Jack Daniels whiskey
The way they do in the Tennessee mountain land
I'd always heard lots about the big apple
So I thought I'd come up here and see
But all I've seen so far is one big hassle
Wish I was camped out on the Okeechobee
If this is the promised land, I've had all I can stand
And I'm headed back below that Dixie line
No, I just don't fit in and I'll never come back again
But I'm busted here and I got Dixie on my mind
Oh, and I'm stuck up here and I got Dixie on my mind
These people never smile or say a word
They're all too busy trying to make an extra dime
Oh, I'd love to haul 'em all down around Spartanburg
And show 'em how they raise hell in Caroline
Oh, the things you know that I miss most of all
Is the freedom of the rivers and the pines
They don't do much huntin' and fishin' up here, you know
But I have met a few squirrels and one porcupine
Well if this is the promised land, I've had all I can stand
Wish I was down in Houston town tonight
Oh, and I'm stuck up here and got Dixie on my mind

===== Hank Williams Jr. - I've Got Rights =====
I went down to the Mary Carter paint store
I said, "Give me one of them Smith & Wesson Magnum .44s"
'Cause there's a man that the law let loose and justice was not done
This man, he killed my wife and my only little son
I'll never forget the way he looked all through the trial
He had his big-name lawyer and he had that smirky smile
Woah, yeah, he got you off on a technicality
But you have to grow wings and fly to ever get away from me
'Cause I got rights, I got rights too
And this time there won't be no damn lawyers and systems to protect you
But I'm gonna read you, I'm gonna read you your rights
You got a right to know that you gonna go to hell one of these black nights
And when the trial was over, he had the nerve to say, "That's the way it goes"
I said, "Well, Hoss, you'd better get you some corks, 'cause you're gonna have to plug up a few holes"
Guess he thought I was talkin' just to pass away time
But he kinda looks different now on his knees, beggin' for his life
Hey, I got rights, I got some rights too
Because I want you to know that you're gonna go to hell one of these black nights
Naw, and this time there ain't no damn lawyers and systems to save you

===== Hank Williams Jr. - The Blues Man =====
I'm just a singer, a natural-born guitar ringer
Kind of a clinger to sad old songs
I'm not a walk-behinder, I'm a new note finder
But my name's a reminder of a blues man that's already gone
So I started drinkin', took things that messed up my thinkin'
I was sure sinkin' when you came along
I was alone in the hot lights, not too much left in sight
But she changed all that one night when she sang me this song
"Hey baby, I love you, hey baby, I need you
Hey baby, you ain't got to prove to me you're some kind of macho man
You've wasted so much of your life, runnin' through the dark nights
Let me shine some love light, down on the blues man"
I got so sick from speedin', all the stuff they said I wasn't needin'
If I was to keep pleasin' all of my fans
I got cuffed on dirt roads, I got sued over no-shows
But she came and took all that old load down off this blues man
Hey baby, I love you too, hey baby, I need you
Hey baby, I do get tired of this travelin' band
I'm 30 years old now, nights would be cold now
If you hadn't stuck it out with this blues man
I'm 30 years old now, nights sure would be cold now
If you hadn't hung around with this blues man

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Kaw-Liga =====
Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian standin' over by the door
Fell in love with a Choctaw maid over in the Georgia store
Kaw-Liga, ooh, standin' there, don't never let it show
She don't ever answer, yes or no
He always wore his Sunday feathers and carried his old blackhawk
Maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga, ooh, standin' there, don't never show a sign
'Cause his heart is made of knotty pine
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you ain't never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you don't know what you what miss
Is it any wonder that your face is red?
Kaw-Liga, you poor old wooden head
Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian, never went nowhere
Heart was set on the Choctaw maid wearin' the long, black hair
'Cause his heart was made of knotty pine
And then one day, a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
Took her oh so far away and ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Kaw-Liga, ooh, standin' there, as lonesome as can be
Ah, just wishin' he were still an ol' pine tree
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you just ain't never had no kissin'
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, hoss, you don't know what you're missin'
Is it any wonder, that your face is red?
Kaw-Liga, you poor, ol' wooden head
Just a head

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Mind Your Own Business =====
If the wife and I are fussin', brother, that's all right
'Cause me and that woman bought a license to fight
Why don't you mind your own business
Mind your own business
'Cause if you mind your business
Then you won't be mindin' mine
Oh, the man in the apartment, he's a nosy thing
He comes to my door and it's a ring, ring, ring
You, mind your own business
Hey, won't you mind your own business
'Cause if you mind your own business
Yeah, I got a little girl, wears her hair up high
The boys all quiver when she walks by
You better mind your own business
Yes, mind your own business
If you mind your own business
Mindin' other people's business seems to be high tone
I got all that I can do, I'm mindin' my own
You won't be mindin' mine
I may tell a lotta stories that may not be true
But I can get to Heaven just as easily as you
So, won't you mind your own business
Hey, if I wanna honky-tonk around to two or three
Baby, that's my headache, don't you worry about me
Just mind your own business
Well, if you mind your business
You'll be busy all the time

===== Johnny Cash - Hurt =====
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend?
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way

===== Johnny Cash - Highwayman =====
I was a highway man along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive
I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still
I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around, I'll always be around
And around and around and around and around
I fly a starship across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again
And again and again and again and again

===== Johnny Cash - Folsom Prison Blues (Live at Folsom State Prison, Folsom, CA - January 1968) =====
"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash."
I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby my mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry
Suey!
I bet there's rich folks eating from a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin' and that's what tortures me
Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

===== Johnny Cash - God's Gonna Cut You Down =====
You can run on for a long time
Run on for a long time
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down
Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on bended knee, talkin' to the man from Galilee
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angels' feet
He called my name and my heart stood still
When he said, "John, go do My will!"
Well, you may throw your rock, and hide your hand
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
But as sure as God made black and white
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down

===== Johnny Cash - I Walk the Line =====
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide

===== Johnny Cash - I Walk The Line =====
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I find it very, very easy to be true

Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide

===== Johnny Cash - Girl From The North Country =====
If you're travelin' the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
If you go when snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds
Please see if her hair hangs long
It rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hangin' long
For that's the way I remember her best
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my of my day
So if you're travelin' the north country fair

===== Johnny Cash - Jackson =====
We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson ever since the fire went out
I'm going to Jackson, I'm gonna mess around
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson
Look out, Jackson town
Well, go on down to Jackson, go ahead and wreck your health
Go play your hand, you big-talkin' man, and make a big fool of yourself
Yeah, go to Jackson, go comb your hair
Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson
See if I care
When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow (Hah)
All them women gonna make me, teach 'em what they don't know how
I'm goin' to Jackson, you turn-a loose-a my coat
'Cause I'm goin' to Jackson
"Goodbye," that's all she wrote
But they'll laugh at you in Jackson, and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg
They'll lead you 'round town like a scolded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs
Yeah, go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson, behind my Japan Fan
Well now, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
I'm goin' to Jackson, and that's a fact
Yeah, we're goin' to Jackson
Ain't never comin' back
Well, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
Honey, we've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went

===== Johnny Cash - (Ghost) Riders in the Sky =====
An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowin' through the ragged skies, and up a cloudy draw
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny, and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard, and he heard their mournful cry
Yippie-yi-oh, yippie-yi-aie!
Ghost riders in the sky
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
"If you want to save your soul from Hell, a-ridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today, or with us you will ride
Tryin' to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies"

===== Johnny Cash - The Man Comes Around =====
"And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder
One of the four beasts saying, 'Come and see'
And I saw, and behold a white horse"
There's a man goin' 'round takin' names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reachin' down
When the man comes around
The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground?
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singin'
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
Voices callin', voices cryin'
Some are born and some are dyin'
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
Till Armageddon, no shalam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise men will bow down before the throne
And at his feet, they'll cast their golden crowns
Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
In measured hundredweight and penny pound
"And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts 
And I looked, and behold a pale horse:
And his name that sat on him was Death
And Hell followed with him"

===== Johnny Cash - A Boy Named Sue =====
"I want you to, if you don't mind, Carl, I'd like you to stay out and help us on some songs, play the guitar."
"I'd love to!"
"One of the greatest guitar players as well as songwriters and singers in the business. Appreciate a little help on the guitar, all right?"
Well, my daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me "Sue"
Well, he must've thought that it was quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a lots of folks
It seems I had to fight my whole life through
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh then I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named "Sue"
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fists got hard and my wits got keen
Roamed from town to town to hide my shame
But I made me a vow to the Moon and stars
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill the man who gave me that awful name
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me "Sue"
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said, "My name is Sue! How do you do?
Now you gonna die!"
Yeah, that's what I told him!
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a-gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer
I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
And he went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile
And he said, "Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
So I give you that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's that name that helped to make you strong"
Yeah
He said, "Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But you ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in your guts and the spit in your eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue"
Yeah, but what could I do?
What could I do?
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me a son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him
Bill or George! Any damn thing but Sue! I still hate that name!

===== Johnny Cash - I've Been Everywhere =====
I was totin' my pack along the dusty Winnemucca road
When along came a semi with a high an' canvas covered load
"If you're goin' to Winnemucca, Mack, with me you can ride"
And so I climbed into the cab and then I settled down inside
He asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand
And I said, "Listen, I've traveled every road in this here land"
I've been everywhere, man
Crossed the desert's bare, man
I've breathed the mountain air, man
Of travel I've a-had my share, man
I've been everywhere
I've been to Reno, Chicago, Fargo, Minnesota
Buffalo, Toronto, Winslow, Sarasota
Wichita, Tulsa, Ottawa, Oklahoma
Tampa, Panama, Mattawa, La Paloma
Bangor, Baltimore, Salvador, Amarillo
Tocopilla, Barranquilla, and Padilla, I'm a killer
I've been to Boston, Charleston, Dayton, Louisiana

Monterey, Faraday, Santa Fe, Tallapoosa
Glen Rock, Black Rock, Little Rock, Oskaloosa
Tennessee, Tennessee, Chicopee, Spirit Lake
Grand Lake, Devil's Lake, Crater Lake, for Pete's sake
I've been to Louisville, Nashville, Knoxville, Ombabika

Chaska, Nebraska, Alaska, Opelaka
Baraboo, Waterloo, Kalamazoo, Kansas City
Sioux City, Cedar City, Dodge City, what a pity

===== Johnny Cash - Personal Jesus =====
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Someone who's there
Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer
Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver
Reach out and touch faith
Someone to care

===== Johnny Cash - Folsom Prison Blues =====
I hear the train a-comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby, my mama told me, "Son

Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

===== Johnny Cash - Get Rhythm =====
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and' roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues
A little shoeshine boy he never gets low down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bending low at the peoples' feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from getting the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
He popped a shoeshine rag and then he said
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all your trouble from your worried mind
Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was going to jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a working that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a popping and he said again
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
But does a million dollars worth of good for you

===== Johnny Cash - Ain't No Grave =====
Johnny Cash:
There ain't no grave
Can hold my body down
Can hold my body down
When I hear the trumpet sound
I'ma rise right out of the ground
Verse 1:
Rise from the dirt man, rise from hurt
Speak Life over the bones and it'll make a body turn
Crack the urns and watch a dead man come to life, heard what I said
Been through the dirt and grime now you're a witness to the walkin' dead
Anxiety couldn't kill me suicide was laid to the land
Depression had me in the ground with a shovel in its hand
I had arrows in the back from the ones who were above me
And I've had knives in my chest from the ones who said they loved me
Like Lazarus, I rose so brother I can testify
He rose me from the dead and did it right in front of their eyes
They thought wouldn't see til the day my spirit's captured
But the author of life chose to add a chapter
The tombstones will crumble 'cuz the voice of God rumbles
And the corpses of chosen they will rise from the rubble
So I got tales from the crypt and believe they're full of hope
You said you don't believe in zombies but the dead woke
Hook: Johnny Cash & (Sharon Irving)
(Ain't no grave)
(Hold my body down)
(When I hear that trumpet sound)
(I'm gonna rise right out of the ground)
Verse 2:
With this new life given I'll make sure the work's divine
As long as my heart is beating, I'll never give a flat line
So my family in the faith, watch your words, be wise
'Cuz the bride of Christ is looking like the Bride of Frankenstein
Body parts are everywhere sown poorly with the gospel
Infested with pestilence and the structure is awful
'Cuz when the church is full of people but the message is worthless
Your little Sunday mass is really a funeral service
The people die from the lack of knowledge says the scripture
When you only see in black and white you'll never see the picture
The very word of God was created to uplift
But how many abused it to send millions to the pit
Don't let fake a servant dig your tomb with their tongue
Stomp the head of the serpent turn your head towards the Son
We lost too many people to those who claimed to be saved
So to the servants of falsehood, I declare there ain't no grave
Verse 3:
Now it's time to speak life to the people who will listen
Put my money where my mouth is that's why Cash is in the rhythm
Adonai can save from the darkest nights of the soul
'Cuz in this game of life you have to give Master control
There ain't no addiction that I know you cannot conquer
Alcohol, drugs, porn I know my God is stronger
Restoring the families the enemy tried breaking
You can lift your head child because of grace amazing
And there ain't no sickness my Father cannot cure
From mental depression to Cancer, I'm sure
I'm a witness to his power so I could never deny it
It only takes a leap of faith and I dare you to try
Put your faith in Messiah who walked through the fire and paid the cost
The man who took on the devil and danced with death, never lost
So place your trust in the Son and cling on to his name
Ain't no grave held the Savior and for you, it's the same
Hook: Johnny Cash
There ain't no grave can hold my body down

===== Johnny Cash - I Won't Back Down =====
Well, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down
Gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around
And I'll keep this world from dragging me down
Gonna stand my ground, and I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
Hey, I will stand my ground, and I won't back down
Well, I know what's right, I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushing me around
But I stand my ground, and I won't back down

===== Johnny Cash - Folsom Prison Blues =====
I hear the train a-comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby, my mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry
I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well, I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me
Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

===== Johnny Cash - One Piece at a Time =====
Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
And went to Detroit, working on assembly line
The first year, they had me putting wheels on Cadillacs
Every day, I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes, I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black
One day, I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now, getting caught meant getting fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand
I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'd know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around
So the very next day, when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friend
I left that day with a lunchbox full of gears
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
The first day, I got me a fuel pump
And the next day, I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts and bolts and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home
Now, up to now, my plan went alright
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts, all the holes were gone
So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help from an adaptor kit
We had that engine running just like a song
Now the headlights, they was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch, all three of 'em come on
The back end looked kind of funny too
But we put it together and when we got through
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail fin
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said, "Honey, take me for a spin"
So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughing for blocks around
But up there at the courthouse, they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up, it took the whole staff
And when they got through, the title weighed sixty pounds
I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
Uh, yeah, Red Ryder?
This is the Cotton Mouth in the Psycho-Billy Cadillac, come on
Huh? This is the Cotton Mouth
And negatory on the cost of this machine, there, Red Ryder
You might say I went right up to the factory and picked it up
It's cheaper that way
Uh, what model is it?
Well, it's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56, '57, '58, '59 automobile
It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67, '68, '69, '70 automobile

===== Loretta Lynn - Coal Miner's Daughter =====
Well, I was born the coal miner's daughter
In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor, but we had love
That's the one thing that Daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar
My Daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field hoeing corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light
And everything would start all over come break of morn'
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard every day
Why, I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain, there was no need
She's smiled in Mommy's understanding way
In the summertime, we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime, we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail-order catalog
Money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night, we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler
Well, a lot of things have changed since way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor
Nothing lives here anymore
Except the memories of a coal miner's daughter

===== Loretta Lynn - Don't Come Home A-Drinkin' (With Lovin' On Your Mind) =====
Well, you thought I'd be waitin' up when you came home last night
You'd been out with all the boys and you ended up half-tied
But liquor and love, they just don't mix, leave the bottle or me behind
And don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
No, don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
Just stay out there on the town and see what you can find
'Cause if you want that kind of love, well, you don't need none of mine
So don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
You never take me anywhere, because you're always gone
And many a night I've laid awake and cried, dear, all alone
Then you come in a kissin' on me, it happens every time

===== Loretta Lynn - You Ain't Woman Enough =====
You've come to tell me something you say I ought to know
That he don't love me anymore and I'll have to let him go
You say you're gonna take him, oh but I don't think you can
'Cause you ain't woman enough to take my man
Women like you, they're a dime a dozen
You can buy 'em anywhere
For you to get to him, I'd have to move over
And I'm gonna stand right here
It'll be over my dead body, so get out while you can
Sometimes a man starts lookin' at things that he don't need
Hе took a second look at you, but he's in love with mе
Well I don't know where that leaves you, but I know where I stand
And you ain't woman enough to take my man
No, you ain't woman enough to take my man

===== Loretta Lynn - Fist City =====
A-you've been making your brags around town
That you've been a-loving my man
But the man I love, when he picks up trash
He puts it in a garbage can
And that's what you look like to me
And what I see is a pity
You'd better close your face and stay out of my way
If you don't wanna go to Fist City
You'd better detour around my town
'Cause I'll grab you by the hair of the head
And I'll lift you off of the ground
I'm not a-sayin' my baby is a saint, 'cause he ain't
And that he won't cat around with a kitty
I'm here to tell you, gal, to lay off of my man
Come on and tell me what you told my friends
If you think you're brave enough
And I'll show you what a real woman is
Since you think you're hot stuff
You'll bite off more than you can chew
If you get too cute or witty
You better move your feet, if you don't wanna eat
A meal that's called Fist City

===== Loretta Lynn - You're The Reason Our Kids Are Ugly =====
You're the reason I'm ridin' around on recapped tires
And you're the reason I'm hangin' our clothes outside on wires
And you're the reason our kids are ugly, little darlin'
Ah, but looks ain't everything
And money ain't everything
But I love you just the same
Well, you're the reason I changed to beer from soda pop
And you're the reason I never get to go to the beauty shop
You're the reason our kids are ugly, little darlin'
I guess that we won't ever have everything we need
'Cause when we get ahead, it's got another mouth to feed
And that's the reason that my good looks and my figure is gone
And that's the reason that I ain't got no hair to comb
Conway, why in the devil don't you go and shave
And put on a clean pair of pants?
Well, Loretta, look at yourself
I wish you'd take them curlers out of your hair and
And go put on a little makeup and
And get out of that housecoat before supper
Ha, well let me tell you somethin', Conway
Considerin' everything that I went through today, I look like a movie star
Yeah, Ruth Buzzi
Thank you
Besides that, all of our kids took after your part of the family anyway
Oh, they did, huh?
What about the one's that's bald?
Well, I guess you might say they took after me

===== Loretta Lynn - Blue Kentucky Girl =====
You left me for the bright lights of the town
A country boy set out to see the world
Remember when those city lights shine down
That big old moon shines on your Kentucky Girl
I swear I love you by the moon above you
How bright is it shining in your world?
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky Girl
Don't wait to bring great riches home to me
I need no diamond rings or fancy pearls
Just bring yourself, you're all I'll ever need
That's good enough for this blue Kentucky Girl
I swear I love you by stars above you

===== Loretta Lynn - These Boots Are Made For Walkin' =====
You keep sayin' you got something for me
Something you call love, but confess, yes
You've been a-messin' where you shouldn't have been a-messin'
And now someone else is gettin' all your best
These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you
You keep lyin' when you ought to be truthin'
And you keep losin' when you oughta not bet
You keep samin' when you oughta be a-changin'
But what's right is right and you ain't been right yet
You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burned
I've just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah
And what he knows, you ain't had time to learn
Come on, boots, let's walk all over him

===== Loretta Lynn - You're Lookin' At Country =====
Well, I like my loving done country-style
And this little girl would walk a country mile
To find her a good old slow-talking country boy
I said a country boy
I'm about as old-fashioned as I can be
And I hope you're liking what you see
'Cause if you're looking at me
You're looking at country
You don't see no city when you look at me
'Cause a-country's all I am
I love running barefooted through the old cornfields
And I love that country ham
Well, you say I'm a-made just to fit your plans
But does a barnyard shovel fit your hands?
If your eyes are on me
You're lookin' at country
This here country is a little green
And there's a lot of country that a-you ain't seen
I'll show you around, if you'll show me a wedding band
I said a wedding band
When it comes to love, well, I know about that
Country folks all know where it's at
If you're looking at me
'Cause country's all I am
I love a-running barefooted through the old cornfields

===== Loretta Lynn - One's On The Way =====
They say to have her hair done, Liz flies all the way to France
And Jackie's seen in a discotheque doing a brand new dance
And the White House social season should be glittering and gay
But here in Topeka, the rain is a-falling
The faucet is a-dripping and the kids are a-bawling
One of them a-toddling and one is a-crawling
And one's on the way
I'm glad that Raquel Welch just signed a million dollar pact
And Debbie's out in Vegas, working up a brand new act
While the TV's showing Newlyweds, a real fun game to play
But here in Topeka, the screen door's a-banging
The coffee's boiling over and the wash needs a-hanging
One wants a cookie and one wants a changing
Now what was I doing? Jimmy, get away from there, darn, there goes the phone
Hello, honey, what's that you say? You're bringing a few old Army buddies home?
You're calling from a bar? Get away from there
No, not you, honey, I was talkin' to the baby
Wait a minute, honey, the doorbell
Honey, could you stop at the market and— hello? Hello?
Well, I'll be
The girls in New York City, they all march for women's lib
And Better Homes and Gardens shows the modern way to live
And the pill may change the world tomorrow, but meanwhile today
Here in Topeka, the flies are a-buzzing
The dog is a-barking and the floor needs a scrubbing
One needs a spanking and one needs a hugging
Lord, one's on the way
Oh, gee, I hope it ain't twins again

===== Loretta Lynn - As Soon As I Hang Up The Phone =====
Hello
Hello Loretta
Darlin', I knew it was you
Loretta, there's something I just got to tell ya...
Oh, please, tell me what to do
I don't...really know how to say this...but I wanna tell ya that I...
You gave me the will to go on
As soon as I picked up the phone
No...no, you don't understand Loretta.  I'm tryin' to tell you that I...
The talk is around that we're through
Yeah, I know...I've heard it too...
Oh, darlin', tell me what to do
But that's just it, that's what I'm tryin' to tell ya...I wanna tell ya that I...
I knew you'd tell me they were wrong
Ah, but it is true...they're not wrong...
Oh no
I'm sorry Loretta
Oh no...I can't believe that it's true
I'm sorry Loretta...I'm really, really sorry
Oh no, oh no
I can't believe that we're through
I know you know that I...I never thought it would come to this, but...
You tell me it's over and done
I really thought that I loved ya...and you know that
You say that you've had all your fun
And you just got to believe me that I never meant to hurt you
But I can't believe you'll be gone
As soon as I hang up the phone
This is the hardest thing that I've ever had to do...and it hurts me too
Yeah I'll be gone
Goodbye Loretta

===== Loretta Lynn - Lay Me Down =====
I've raised my head and set my sail
In the eye of a storm and the belly of a whale
My spirit stood on solid ground
I'll be at peace when they lay me down
When I was a child, I cried
Until my needs were satisfied
My needs have grown up, pound for pound
When they lay me down someday
My soul will rise and fly away
This old world will turn around
This life isn't fair, it seems
It's filled with tears and broken dreams
There are no tears where I am bound
And I'll be at peace when they lay me down

===== Loretta Lynn - Country Christmas =====
Mommy pop the popcorn and we string it on the tree
Apples nuts and candy oh what a Christmas feel
Daddy play the organ and we'll all sing Silent Night
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright
A good old country Christmas that's what it's gonna be
With all the family gathered round our pretty Christmas tree
We'll open up our presents Christmas Eve about midnight
Aunt Annie Belle will be here uncle Bill and darn our kids
We'll make ballets on the floor just like we always did
Grandmama bake the pies and cakes oh what a pretty sight
A good old country Christmas...

===== Loretta Lynn - The Pill =====
You wined me and dined me when I was your girl
Promised if I'd be your wife, you'd show me the world
But all I've seen of this old world is a bed and a doctor bill
I'm tearing down your brooder house 'cause now I've got the pill
All these years, I've stayed at home while you had all your fun
And every year that's gone by, another baby's come
There's gonna be some changes made right here on Nursery Hill
You've set this chicken your last time 'cause now I've got the pill
This old maternity dress I've got is going in the garbage
The clothes I'm wearing from now on won't take up so much yardage
Miniskirts, hot pants, and a few little fancy frills
Yeah, I'm making up for all those years since I've got the pill
I'm tired of all your crowing how you and your hens play
While holding a couple in my arms, another is on the way
This chicken's done tore up her nest and I'm ready to make a deal
And you can't afford to turn it down 'cause you know I've got the pill
This incubator is over-used because you've kept it filled
But feeling good comes easy now since I've got the pill
It's getting dark, it's roosting time, tonight's too good to be real
Aw, but Daddy don't you worry none 'cause Mama's got the pill
Oh, Daddy don't you worry none 'cause Mama's got the pill

===== Loretta Lynn - I'm A Honky Tonk Girl =====
Ever since you left me, I've done nothing but wrong
Many nights I've laid awake and cried
We once were happy, my heart was in a whirl
But now I'm a honky tonk girl
So turn that jukebox way up high
And fill my glass up while I cry
I've lost everything in this world
And now I'm a honky tonk girl
I just can't make a right with all of my wrongs
Every evening of my life seems so long
I'm sorry and ashamed for all these things you see
But losing him has made a fool of me
So fill my glass up to the rim
To lose my memory of him

===== Loretta Lynn - Out Of My Head And Back In My Bed =====
Lying alone in this big old bed, I got you on my mind
I said when you left, I could make it by myself, but it gets harder all the time
And I can't take it no more, I see your face every time I close my eyes
So I'm going out now and I'm looking for you some winter night
I want you out of my head and back in my bed before the morning sun comes up
I can't stand another night without you holding me tight, how I miss your loving touch
I'm going searching everywhere that you might be
When I find you, I'm a-bringing you home with me
I want you out of my head and back in my bed before the morning comes
Well, I might find somebody new to share my misery
But no other man can do what you can when it comes to loving me
I don't want nobody to say that I was a fool for being cool
I won't be satisfied 'til you're back in my arms and I'm loving you
And when I find you, I'm a-bringing you home with me

===== Loretta Lynn - Easy Loving =====
Easy lovin' so sexy lookin'
I know from the feelin' it comes from the heart
Easy lovin' everyday's things givin'
To count on my blessin's I would know where to start
Everytime I look you over
So real to life it seems
Mhm upon your pretty shoulders
There's a pair of angel wings
Easy lovin'
Seein's believin'
Life with you is like livin'
In a beautiful dream
Easy lovin'...

===== Loretta Lynn - Always on my Mind =====
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I should have
And maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Boy, I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me, give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

===== Loretta Lynn - Feelins' =====
Feelin's just lead us on till we know
Where we're goin', hmm
If I told you that I loved you
Could we slip away where the lights're low?
And if I put my arms around you
And held you close could you tell me no
Well, you know that I'd be lyin'
If I said, I was a tryin' to let you know I'd go
Let love take me where we've never been before
You don't know how long, I wanted
To have you where you are right now
With you looking soft and pretty
Ain't no telling where we've found
Now here we are together, too close with talkin'
I can't tell you no, whoa
Yes, love take us where we've never been before
Feelin's, hmm

===== Loretta Lynn - Wine, Women And Song =====
While I'm at home a-workin' and a-slavin' this way
You're out a-misbehavin', spendin' all of your pay
On wine, women, and song
While I'm a-makin' beds, you're out a-makin' time
You robbed my piggy bank and spent my last thin dime
Well, one of these nights, you're gonna come home
You'll find it's comin' home to you
You'll see what you've done and what's good for one
It's also good for two
When you're in the doghouse with that mangy old pup
You may start to thinkin' and a-givin' up
Your wine, women, and song
Well one of these nights, you're gonna come home

===== The Carter Family - Anchored in Love =====
I found a sweet haven of sunshine at last
In Jesus abiding above
His dear arms around me are lovingly cast
And sweetly he tells his love
The tempest is o'er
(The dangerous tempest forever is o'er)
I'm safe evermore
(My anchor is holding, I'm safe evermore)
What gladness, what rapture is mine
(What gladness, what rapture is mine)
The danger is past
(The waters are peaceful, the danger is past)
I'm anchored at last
(My spirit is happy, I'm anchored at last)
I'm anchored in love divine
(I'm anchored in love divine)
He saw me endangered and lovingly came
To pilot my stormy doomed soul
Sweet peace he has spoken and bless his dear name
The billows no longer roll
His love shall enfold me through life and in death
Completely I'll trust to the end
I'll praise him each hour and my last fleeting breath
Shall sing of my soul's best friend

===== The Carter Family - I'll Be All Smiles Tonight =====
I'll deck my brow with roses
The loved ones may be there
And gems that others give me
Will shine within my hair
And even those who know me
Will think my heart is light
Though my heart may break tomorrow
I'll be all smiles tonight
I'll be all smiles tonight, love
Oh, when the dance commences
Oh, how I will rejoice
I'll sing the song you taught me
Without a falling voice
When the flattering ones come around me
They'll think my heart is light
And when the room he enters
With a bride upon his arm
I stood and gazed upon him
As though he was a charm
And onced he smiled upon her
And onced he smiled on me
They know not what I suffered
They found no change in me

===== The Carter Family - Keep on the Sunny Side =====
There's a dark and a troubled side of life
There's a bright and a sunny side, too
Though we meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view
Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life
The storm and its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that we cherished so dear
Clouds and storm will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear
Let us greet with a song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Savior always
To keep us every one in His care

===== The Carter Family - Little Moses =====
Away by the river so clear
The ladies were winding their way
And Pharaoh's little daughter stepped down in the water
To bathe in the cool of the day
Before it was dark, she opened the ark
And found the sweet infant was there
And away by the waters so blue
The infant was lonely and sad
She took him in pity and thought him so pretty
And it made little Moses so glad
She called him her own, her beautiful son
And sent for a nurse who was near
And away by the rivers so clear
They carried the beautiful child
To his own tender mother,his sister and brother
Little Moses looked happy and smiled
His mother so good done all that she could
To rear him and teach him with care
And away by the sea that was red
Little Moses, the servant of God
While in him confided, the sea was divided
As upwards he lifted his rod
The Jews safely crossed while Pharaoh's host
Was drownded in the waters and lost
And away on the mountain so high
The last one that ever might see
While in his victorious, his hopes were most glorious
He'd soon o'er the Jordan be free
When his labor did cease, he departed in peace
And rested in the Heavens above

===== The Carter Family - Mid the Green Fields of Virginia =====
Mid the green fields of Virginia in the vale of Shenandoah
There's an ivy covered homestead that I love
With its white old fashioned chimney and its simple homelike airs
This the home of my dear parents now above
There's a peaceful cottage there, a happy home so dear
My heart is longing for them day by day
Where I spent life's golden hours in the vale of Shenandoah
Mid the green fields of Virginia far away
Mid the green fields of Virginia stands an old mill by the stream
I would wander to that spot to sing and play
And how often I would throw a stone into the babbling brook
And dream some day it would carry be away

===== The Carter Family - My Clinch Mountain Home =====
Far away on a hill to a sunny mountain side
Many years ago we parted, my little Ruth and I
From the sunny mountain side
She clung to me and trembled when I told her we must part
She said, "Don't go, my darling, it almost breaks my heart
To think of you so far apart"
Carry me back to old Virginia
Back to my clinch mountain home
Back to my old mountain home
Oh, my mountain home
I fold my arms around her, leaned her head upon my breast
I told her I would wed her when I came back from the west
To my old clinch mountain home
In my hand I hold a picture of the old home far away
In the other one my sweetheart I'm thinking of today
On the sunny mountain side

===== The Carter Family - Picture on the Wall =====
There's an old and faded picture on the wall
That has been a-hanging there for many a-year
This a picture of my mother
For I know there is no other
That can take the place of mother on the wall
On the wall (on the wall) on the wall (on the wall)
How I love that dear old picture on the wall
Time is quickly passing by and I bow my head and cry
Because I know I'll meet my mother after all
Yes, the children all have gathered, all have gone
And I have a little family of my own
And I know I love them well
More than any time can tell
But I'll hold that dear old picture on the wall
Since I lost that dear old mother years ago
There is none to which with troubles I can go
As my guitar makes its chords
I am praying to the Lord
Let me hold that dear old picture on the wall

===== The Carter Family - Wabash Cannonball =====
Out from the wide Pacific to the broad Atlantic shore
She climbs flowery mountains, over hills and by the shore
Although she's tall and handsome and she's known quite well by all
She's a regular combination of the Wabash Cannonball
Oh, the eastern states are dandy, so the western people say
Chicago, Rock Island, St. Louis by the way
To the lakes of Minnesota, where the rippling waters fall
No changes to be taken on the Wabash Cannonball
Oh, listen to the jingle, the rumour and the roar
As she glides along the woodlands, over hills and by the shore
She climbs the flowery mountains, hear the merrier hobo squall
She glides along the woodlands, the Wabash Cannonball
Oh, here's old Daddy Cleton, let his name forever be
And long be remembered in the courts of Tennessee
For he is a good old rounder, till the curtain round him fall
He'll be carried back to victory on the Wabash Cannonball
I have rode the I.C. Limited, also the Royal Blue
Across the eastern countries, on mail car number two
I have rode those high ball trains from coast to coast, that's all
But I have found no equal to the Wabash Cannonball

===== The Carter Family - Wildwood Flower =====
Oh, I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald dew
The pale amanita and eyes look like blue
I will dance, I will sing, and my loft shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming my idol was clay
All portion of love had all flown away
Oh, he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell
Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
That's blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower

===== The Carter Family - Worried Man Blues =====
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now
But I won't be worried long
I went across the river, I lay down to sleep
When I woke up
Had shackles on my feet
Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg
And on each leg
The initials of my name
I asked the judge, what might be my fine?
Twenty-one years
On the Rocky Mountain Line
The train I ride, sixteen coaches long
The girl I love
Is on that train and gone
If anyone asks you who composed this song
Tell 'em was I
And I sing it all day long

===== The Carter Family - Foggy Mountain Top =====
If I was on some foggy mountain top
I'd sail away to the west
I'd sail all around this whole wide world
To the girl I love the best
If I had listened what mama says
I would not have been here today
A-lying around this old jail house
A-weeping my sweet life away
Yeah, oh-lay-ee-oh, lee-oh-la-ee-ay
Lee-oh-lay-ee, lay-ee, oh-lay-ee
Oh, when you see that girl of mine
There is something you must tell her
She need not to fool no time away
To court some other feller
She's caused me to weep, she's caused me to mourn
She caused me to leave my home
For that lonesome pine and those good old times
I am on my way back home
Oh, when you go a-courting
I'll tell you how to do
Pull off that long-tailed roustabout
Put on your navy blue

===== The Carter Family - Gold Watch and Chain =====
Darling, how can I stay here without you
I have nothing to cheer my poor heart
This old world would seem sad, love, without you
Tell me now that we're never to part
Oh, I'll pawn you my gold watch and chain, love
And I'll pawn you my gold diamond ring
I will pawn you this heart in my bosom
Only say that you love me again
Take back all the gifts you have given
But a ring and a lock of your hair
And a card with your picture upon it
It's a face that is false, but it's fair
Tell me why that you do not love me
Tell me why that your smile is not bright
Tell me why you have grown so cold-hearted
Is there no kiss for me, love, tonight?

===== The Carter Family - I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes =====
Would have been better for us both had we never
In this wide and wicked world had never met
For the pleasure we've both seen together
I am sure, love, I'll never forget
Oh, I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes
Who is sailing far over the sea
And I wonder if he ever thinks of me
Oh, you told me once, dear, that you loved me
You said that we never would part
But a link in the chain has been broken
Leaves me with a sad and aching heart
When the cold, cold grave shall enclose me
Will you come, dear, and shed just one tear
And say to the strangers around you
A poor heart you have broken lies here

===== The Carter Family - Keep on the Firing Line =====
If you're in the battle for the Lord and right
Just keep on the firing line
If you win the battle, surely you must fight
So keep on the firing line
Brother, keep on the firing line
Keep on the firing line
Time is getting short, Jesus coming soon
There are many dangers everyone must face
If you die fighting, there is no disgrace
With the Lord for cowards you will find no place
God can only use the soldiers he can trust
To keep on the firing line
If you wear the crown, bear the cross you must

===== The Carter Family - My Old Cottage Home =====
I am thinking tonight of an old cottage home
That stands on the brow of the hill
Where in life's early morning I once loved to roam
But now all is quiet and still
Oh, my old cottage home, my old cottage home
Many years have gone by since in prayers there I knelt
With dear ones around the old hearth
But my mother's sweet prayers in my heart still are felt
I'll treasure them all while on earth
One by one they have gone from the old cottage home
On earth we shall see them no more
But we'll meet them again on that beautiful shore
Where parting will come nevermore

===== The Carter Family - On the Sea of Galilee =====
Am I a soldier of the cross
A follower of the Lamb
And shall I fear to own His cause
Or blush to speak His name
On the sea (the sea, the sea)
Of Galilee (of Galilee)
My Jesus is walking on the sea
Must I be carried to the skies
On flowery beds of ease
While others walk to win the prize
And sail through bloody seas
There shall I bathe my weary soul
In seas of heavenly rest
And not a wave of trouble roll
Across my peaceful breast

===== The Carter Family - The Church in the Wildwood =====
There's a church in the valley by the wildwood,
No lovelier place in the dale
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the dale
CHORUS
Oh come, come, come, come
Come to the church in the wildwood
Oh come to the church in the dale
How sweet on a clear Sabbath morning
To listen to the clear ringing bell
Its tones so sweetly are calling
There close by the side of a loved one
’neath the trees where the wild flowers bloom
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps ‘neath a willow
Disturb not her rest in the tomb
CHORUS (x2)

===== The Carter Family - The Storms are on the Ocean =====
I'm going away to leave you, love
I'm going away for a while
But I'll return to you some time
If I go 10,000 miles
The storms are on the ocean
The heavens may cease to be
This world may lose its motion, love
If I prove false to thee
Oh, who will dress your pretty little feet
Oh, who will glove your hand
Who will kiss your rosy red cheeks
When I'm in the far off land
Oh, papa will dress my pretty little feet
And mama will glove my hand
You can kiss my rosy red cheeks
When you return again
Oh, have you seen those lonesome doves
Flying from pine to pine
A-mourning for their own true loves
Just like I mourn for mine
I'll never go back on the ocean, love
I'll never go back on the sea
I'll never go back on the blue-eyed girl
Till she goes back on me

===== The Carter Family - Lonesome Pine Special =====
I was walking out this morning
With rambling on my mind
I am going to catch the special
That train called Lonesome Pine
You can hear the whistle blowing
And she's coming down the line
That's the train I catch this morning
To ease my troubling mind
Well, ah-le-ho, ah-le-ho-lay
Take me back to Texas
Back to my old home
Oh, I'm weeping like a willow
And I'm mourning like a dove
There's a girl way out in Texas
That I know I really love
Oh, I'm going back to Texas
Where the lonesome coyotes whine
Where the longhorn cattle are roaming
Around that cabin home of mine
Oh, give me back my rifle
Oh, give me back my gun
Give me back my home in Texas
And my rambling days are done

===== Willie Nelson - On the Road Again =====
One two
One two three four
On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
I can't wait to get on the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way
Is on the road again
I just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
Alright, thank you very much

===== Willie Nelson - Always On My Mind =====
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second-best
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
And you were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
And give me, give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied
But you were always on my mind

===== Willie Nelson - Good Hearted Woman =====
A long time forgotten are dreams that just felt by the way
And the good life he promised ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass though his world hand in hand
A good hearted woman lovin' her good timin' man
He likes the night life the bright lights and good timin' friends
When the party's all over she welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him but she does the best that she can
To be a good hearted woman to a do no good good timin' man
And she loves him in spite of his wicked ways that she don't understand
She loves me in spite of my wicked mouse ways and things that she don't understand

===== Willie Nelson - Pancho And Lefty =====
Living on the road, my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
And now you wear your skin like iron
And your breath as hard as kerosene
You weren't your momma's only boy
But her favorite one, it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit boy
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match, you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
But that's the way it goes
All the Federales say
They could've had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down South
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows
We only let him slip away
The poets tell how Pancho fell
And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends, we're told
Pancho needs your prayers, it's true
But save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growing old
(All the Federales say)
(We could've had him any day)
They only let him go so long
A few gray Federales say

===== Willie Nelson - Blue Eyes Crying In the Rain =====
In the twilight glow I see them
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand-in-hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Now my hair has turned to silver
All my life I've loved in vain
I can see her star in heaven

===== Willie Nelson - Seven Spanish Angels =====
He looked down into her brown eyes
And said "Say a prayer for me"
She threw her arms around him
Whispered "God will keep us free"
They could hear the riders coming
He said "This is my last fight
If they take me back to Texas
They won't take me back alive"
There were seven Spanish angels
At the altar of the sun
They were praying for the lovers
In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home
She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smoking in his hand
She said, "Father please forgive me
I can't make it without my man"
And she knew the gun was empty
And she knew she couldn't win
Her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again
At the alter of the sun
When the battle stopped
And the smoke cleared
Come on Willie, help me with this thing
At the Altar of the Sun (Oh I believe)
They were praying for the lovers (Yeah they was)
In the Valley of the Gun (Well, well, well)
There was thunder from the throne (Oh, yeah)
Took another Angel home

===== Willie Nelson - Whiskey River =====
Whiskey River take my mind
Don't let her mem'ry torture me
Whiskey River don't run dry
You're all I've got, take care of me
I'm drowning in a whiskey river
Bathing my mem'ried mind
In the wetness of its soul
Feeling the amber current
Flowin' from my mind
And leaving a heart you left so cold
1:42 - 2:13
Whiskey River take my mind (take my mind)
3:02 - 3:30

===== Willie Nelson - Just Breathe =====
Yes, I understand that every life must end, uh-huh
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
Oh, I'm a lucky man to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one, yeah well, others, they've got none uh-huh
Stay with me, oh
Let's just breathe
Practiced are my sins, never gonna let you win, uh-huh
Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh
And I don't want to hurt, there's so much in this world
To make me believe
Stay with me
You're all I see
Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
Or if I didn't, I'm a fool, you see
No one knows this more than me
But I come clean
I wonder every day, as I look upon your face, uh-huh
Everything you gave and nothing you would take, uh-huh
Nothing you would take
Everything you gave
Did I say that I need you? Oh-oh
Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool, you see
As I come clean, oh
Love you 'til I die
Meet you on the other side

===== Willie Nelson - Have You Ever Seen the Rain =====
Someone told me long ago there's a calm before the storm
I know it's been coming for some time
When it's over, so they say, it'll rain a sunny day
I know; shining down like water
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day?
Yesterday, and days before, sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes through the circle, fast and slow
I know it can't stop, I wonder
Coming down on a sunny day

===== Willie Nelson - City of New Orleans =====
Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
All along the southbound odyssey, the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name and freight yards full of old Black men
And the graveyards full of rusted automobiles
Good morning, America, how are you?
Say, don't you know me? I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
And I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Dealing cards with the old man in the club car
Penny a point, ain't no one keeping score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumbling 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep, rocking to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
Night time on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Halfway home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
But all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again, the passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues

===== Willie Nelson - Roll Me Up =====
Roll me up and smoke me when I die
And if anyone don't like it, just look 'em in the eye
I didn't come here, and I ain't leaving, so don't sit around and cry
Just roll me up and smoke me when I die
Now you won't see no sad and teary eyes
When I get my wings and it's my time to fly
Call my friends and tell 'em there's a party, come on by
Now just roll me up and smoke me when I die
A-just roll me up and smoke me when I die
When I'd go, I'll have been here long enough
So sing and tell more jokes and dance and stuff
Just keep the music playing, that'll be a good goodbye
Hey, take me out and build a roaring fire
Roll me in the flames for about an hour
Then take me out and twist me up, and point me towards the sky
And roll me up and smoke me when I die

===== Willie Nelson - Blue Skies =====
Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see
Blue birds singing a song
Nothing but blue skies from now on
I never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my how they fly by
Blue days, all of them gone

===== Willie Nelson - Frosty the Snowman =====
Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
O, Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me
Thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Over the hills of snow
Frosty the snowman knew
The sun was hot that day
So he said, "Let's run and
We'll have some fun
Now before I melt away."
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all
Around the square saying
Catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler "Stop!"
For Frosty the snow man
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
"Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day."

===== Willie Nelson - Georgia On My Mind =====
Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
An' just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you
No peace I find
Just an old sweet song
On my mind

===== Willie Nelson - Buddy =====
Laugh with me, buddy, jest with me, buddy
Don't let her get the best of me, buddy
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely
If I ever needed you, buddy
You know now I really do, buddy
I cry at the least, little thing, buddy
And I'll die if you mention her name, buddy
Talk to me, buddy, stay with me, buddy
Let's don't let her get away with it, buddy
Let's talk about things as they were, buddy
Before I got mixed up with her, buddy
Let's don't let her get the best of me, buddy

===== Willie Nelson - My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys =====
I grew up a-dreamin' of bein' a cowboy
And lovin' the cowboy ways
Pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes
I burned up my childhood days
I learned of all the rules of the modern-day drifter
Don't you hold on to nothin' too long
Just take what you need from the ladies, then leave them
With the words of a sad country song
My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are, it seems
Sadly in search of, but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow-movin' dreams
Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
From being alone too long
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare
Knowin' well that your best days are gone
Pickin' up hookers instead of my pen
I let the words of my years fade away
Old worn-out saddles, and old worn-out memories
With no one and no place to stay

===== Willie Nelson - Crazy =====
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new
Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wondering, "What in the world did I do?"
I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you

===== Willie Nelson - Baby It's Cold Outside =====
I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away
But baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour
Neighbours might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer
At least I'm going to say that I tried
What's the sense in hurting my pride?
I simply must go
Oh, the answer is no
Your welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is so vicious
Your lips are delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
I've got to go home
Maybe you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died

===== Willie Nelson - Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground =====
If you had not have fallen then I would not have found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
And I patched up your broken wing and hung around a while
Trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down
I knew someday that you would fly away
For love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember
So fly on, fly on past the speed of sound
I'd rather see you up than see you down
Leave me if you need to, I will still remember

===== Willie Nelson - Shotgun Willie =====
Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet, pulling out all of his hair
Now, Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there
Well, you can't make a record if you ain't got nothing to say
You can't make a record if you ain't got nothing to say
You can't play music if you don't know nothing to play
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there
Now, John T. Floores was a-working for the Ku Klux Klan
At six foot five, John T. was a hell of a man
Made a lot of money selling sheets on the family plan

===== Waylon Jennings - Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow up to Be Cowboys =====
Cowboys ain't easy to love
And they're harder to hold
They'd rather give you a song
Than diamonds or gold
Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levis
And each night begins a new day
If you don't understand him and he don't die young
He'll probably just ride away
Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they love
Cowboys like smoky old pool rooms
And clear mountain mornings
Little warm puppies and children
And girls of the night
Them that don't know him
Won't like him and them that do
Sometimes won't know how to take him
He ain't wrong, he's just different
But his pride won't let him
Do things to make you think he's right

===== Waylon Jennings - Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love) =====
The only two things in life that make it worth livin'
Is guitars that tune good and firm feelin' women
I don't need my name in the marquee lights
I got my song and I got you with me tonight
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love
Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas
With Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin'
Got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs and
Newbury's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain
Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain
So baby, let's sell your diamond ring
Buy some boots and faded jeans and go away
This coat and tie is choking me
In your high society you cry all day
We've been so busy keepin' up with the Jones
Four car garage and we're still building on
This successful life we're livin' got us feudin'
Like the Hatfield and McCoys
Newberry's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain
With Willie and Waylon and the boys
This successful life we're livin's got us feudin'
Between Hank Williams' pain songs
And Jerry Jeff's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain
Out in Luckenbach, Texas there ain't nobody feelin' no pain
Songwriters:  Bobby Emmons and Chips Moman

===== Waylon Jennings - Good Hearted Woman =====
A long time forgotten our dreams had just fell by the way
And the good life he promised ain't what she's livin' today
But she never complains of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to come
She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter they'll pass through this world, hand in hand
A good hearted woman, lovin' her good timin' man
He likes the night life, bright lights and good timin' friends
When the party's all over she'll welcome him back home again
Lord knows she don't understand him but she does the best that she can
'Cause she's a good hearted woman, she loves her good timin' man
She loves me in spite of my ways that she don't understand

===== Waylon Jennings - Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way =====
Lord, it's the same old tune, fiddle and guitar
Where do we take it from here?
Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars
It's been the same way for years
We need to change
Somebody told me when I came to Nashville
"Son, you finally got it made!
Old Hank made it here, we're all sure that you will"
But I don't think Hank done it this way, no
I don't think Hank done it this way, okay
Ten years on the road making one night stands
Speeding my young life away
Tell me one more time, just so's I'll understand
Are you sure Hank done it this way?
Did old Hank really do it this a-way?
Lord, I've seen the world with a five-piece band
Looking at the back side of me
Singing my songs and one of his now and then
But I don't think Hank done 'em this way, no
I don't think Hank done 'em this way
Take it home

===== Waylon Jennings - I'm a Ramblin' Man =====
I've been down to Mississippi
Down through New Orleans
Yes I have
I've played in California
There ain't too much I haven't seen
No there ain't
Lord, I'm a ramblin' man
Don't fool around with a ramblin' man
Left a girl in West Virginia
Up there where that green grass grows
Yes I did
Got a girl in Cincinatti
Waitin' where the Ohio River flows
Oh, girl
I'm a ramblin' man
Don't give your heart to a ramblin' man
You better move away
You're standing too close to the flame
Once I mess with your mind
Your little  heart won't be the same
But I'm a ramblin' man
Don't mess around with and ol' ramblin' man
You better not
Well, up in Chicago
I was known as quite a boy
Yes I was
Down in Alabama
They call me the man of joy
Still do
Well, I'm a ramblin' man
Don't fall in love with a ramblin' man
You're standing to close to the flame
Once I mess with the ol' mind
Your little ol' heart won't be the same
Oh, I'm a ramblin' man
Don't mess around with any ol' ramblin man...

===== Waylon Jennings - Theme from "The Dukes of Hazzard" (Good Ol' Boys) =====
Just a good old boys
Never meanin' no harm
Beats all you never saw
Been in trouble with the law since the day they was born
Straightening the curves, yeah
Flattenin' the hills
Someday the mountain might get 'em but the law never will
Makin' their way the only way they know how
That's just a little bit more than the law will allow
Makin' their way the only way they know how (Yeah)
I'm a good old boy
You know my mama loves me
But she don't understand
They keep a-showing my hands and not my face on TV, haha

===== Waylon Jennings - Waymore's Blues =====
Well, I woke up this mornin' it was drizzlin' rain
Around the curve come a passenger train
Heard somebody yodel and a hobo moan
Jimmy he's dead, he's been a long time gone
Been a long time gone, a long time gone
If you want to get to heaven, gotta D-I-E
You gotta put on your coat and T-I-E
Want to get the rabbit out of the L-O-G
You gotta make a commotion like D-O-G
Like D-O-G, like D-O-G, yeah
Well, I got a good woman, what's the matter with me?
What makes me want to love every woman I see?
I was trifling when I met her now I'm trifling again
And every woman she sees looks like the place I came in
Looks like the place I came in place I came in
I got my name painted on my shirt
I ain't no ordinary dude
I don't have to work

===== Waylon Jennings - Lonesome, On'ry and Mean =====
On a Greyhound bus
Lord, I'm traveling this morning
I'm going to Shreveport
And down to New Orleans
Been traveling these highways
Been doing things my way
It's been making me lonesome, ornery, and mean
Now her hair was jet black
And her name was Codeine
She thought she was the cream
Of the Basin Street Queens
She got tired of that smoky wine dream
Began to feel lonesome, ornery, and mean
We got together
And we cashed in our sweeps
Gave 'em to a beggar
Who was mumblin' through the streets
There's no escaping from his snowy white dreams
Born lookin' lonesome, ornery, and mean
Now I'm down in this valley
Where the wheels turn so low
At dawn I pray
To the Lord of my soul
I say, "Dear Lord, do right by me
You know I'm tired of being lonesome, ornery, and mean"

===== Waylon Jennings - I Ain't Living Long Like This =====
I looked for trouble and I found it, son
Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun
I tried to run but I don't think I can
"You make one move and you're a dead man, friend"
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?
He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
Then left me reeling on a steel rail rack
They got 'em all in the jailhouse, baby
Grew up in Houston off of Wayside Drive
Son of a carhop at some all night dive
Dad drove a stock car to an early death
All I remember was a drunk man's breath
You know the story how the wheel goes 'round
Don't let them take you to the man downtown
Can't sleep at all in a jailhouse, baby
I live with Angel, she's a roadhouse queen
Makes Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee
I want to love her but I don't know how
I'm at the bottom of the jailhouse now
You know the story about the jailhouse rock
Don't want to do it, but just don't get caught

===== Waylon Jennings - I've Always Been Crazy =====
I've always been crazy and the trouble that it's put me through
Been busted for things that I did, and I didn't do
I can't say I'm proud of all of the things that I've done
But I can say I've never intentionally hurt anyone
I've always been different with one foot over the line
Winding up somewhere one step ahead or behind
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane
Beautiful lady are you sure that you understand
The chances your taking loving a free living man
Are you really sure you really want what you see
Be careful of something that's just what you want it to be
Nobody knows if it's something to bless or to blame
So far I ain't found a rhyme or a reason to change

===== Waylon Jennings - Only Daddy That'll Walk the Line =====
Everybody knows you've been stepping on my toes
And I'm getting pretty tired of it
You keep a-stepping out of line and a-messing with my mind
If you had any sense, you'd quit
'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
You said I was the only man in this whole world
Now you better do some thinking, then you'll find
You got the only daddy that'll walk the line
I keep a-working every day, all you want to do is play
I'm tired of staying out all night
I'm a-coming unglued from your funny little moods
Now, honey-baby, that ain't right
You keep a-packing up my clothes, nearly everybody knows
That you're still just a-putting me on
But when I start a-walking, gonna hear you start a-squawking
And a-begging me to come back home

===== Waylon Jennings - Never Been to Spain =====
Well, I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it
They don't abuse it
Can't refuse it
Never gonna lose it
Well, I've never been to England
But I kinda like the Beatles
I was headed for Las Vegas
I only made it out to Needles
But can't you feel it
You must believe it
'Cause it feels so good
Well, I've never been to heaven
But I've been to Oklahoma
People tell me I was born there
Lord, I really don't remember
In Oklahoma or Arizona
What does it matter

===== Waylon Jennings - Can't You See =====
Gonna catch a freight train as far as I can Lord
I don't care which way it goes
Gonna climb a mountain, the highest mountain Lord
Jump off ain't nobody gonna know
Can't you see, oh can't you see
What that woman's been doin' to me
Can't you see, can't you see
What that woman's been doin' to me?
Gonna buy a ticket go as far as I can Lord
I ain't never coming back
Take me a southbound all the way down Lord
Till the train run out of track

===== Waylon Jennings - Drinkin' and Dreamin' =====
Everybody's lookin' for some way in
I'm lookin' for some way out
I've been wastin' my time standin' in line
If this is what it's all about
All I got is a job that I don't like
And a woman that don't understand
So tonight at the bar
I'll get in my car
And take off for the promised land
Drinkin' and dreamin'
Knowin' damn well I can't go
I'll never see Texas, L.A., or Old Mexico
But here at this table, I'm able to leave it behind
Drink 'til I'm dreamin', a thousand miles out of my mind
This suit and this tie, is just a disguise
This ain't really me
Some people are born, to be tied down
Some people are born to be free
When I look down the road she don't know
How it gets under my skin
She's got my body but my heart and soul
Are out there ridin' the wind

===== Waylon Jennings - I Can Get off on You =====
Take back the weed, take back the cocaine baby
Take back the pills, take back the whiskey too
I don't need them now, your love was all I was after
I'll make it now, I can get off on you
I can get by on little
Or nothing at all I know
I can get high just thinkin'
About you and so
Well, take back the weed, take back the cocaine baby
Who would have thought
This was somethin' that I'd ever do
I'm working it out
Mellowing out on you

===== Waylon Jennings - Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Got out of Hand =====
I'm for the law and order the way that it should be
This song's about the night they spent protecting you from me
Someone called us outlaws in some old magazine
New York sent a posse down like I ain't never seen
Don't you think this outlaw bit's done got out of hand?
What started out to be a joke, the law don't understand
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?
Maybe this here outlaw bit's done got out of hand...
Out of hand! (Woo!)
We were wrapped up in our music – that's why we never saw
The car pulls up, the boys get out, and the room fill up with law
They came boundin' through the backdoor in the middle of the song
They got me for possession of something that was gone
Long gone
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man? Oh, Lord...
Maybe this here outlaw bit's done got out of hand... (Woo!)
Out of hand!

===== Waylon Jennings - The Conversation =====
Hank, let's talk about your daddy
Tell me how your mama loved that man
Well just break out a bottle, Hoss
I'll tell you about the driftin' cowboy band
We won't talk about the habits
Just the music and the man
That's all
Now Hank, if you just got to tell me
Did your daddy really write all them songs, did he?
That don't deserve no answer, hossL
Et's light up and just move along
Do you think he wrote 'em about your mama
Or about the man who done her wrong?
You know that
Well back then they called him crazy
Nowadays they call him a saint
Now the ones that called him crazy
Are still ridin' on his name
Well if he was here right now, Bocephus
Would he think that we were right, do you think he might?
Don't you know he would, Watasha
Be right by our side
If we left for a show in Provo
He'd be the first one on the bus and ready to ride
"I just wanna go hoss!"
Wherever he is I hope he's happy
And I hope he's doin' well, yes I do
He is, 'cause he's got one arm around my mama now
How he sure did love Miss Audrey and raisin' hell
I won't ask you no more questions
To the stories only Hank could tell
Most folks don't know that they fired him from the Opry
And that caused him the greatest pain
I loved to tell you about lovesick
And how Miss Audrey loved that man
You know I've always loved to listen
To the stories about that driftin' cowboy band, yes man
You know when we get right down to it
Still the most wanted outlaws in the land

===== Waylon Jennings - Just to Satisfy You =====
Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through
Someone's gonna pay for the things you do
How many hearts must break, how many is it gonna take
To satisfy you, just to satisfy you
Another love, another fool
To play your game
They're all the same
You're gonna find when it's too late, a heart that just won't break
Just to satisfy you, just to satisfy you
How many hearts must break, how many will it take
Just to satisfy you, satisfy you, to satisfy you
Gonna find when it's too late, a heart that just won't break
Just to satisfy you, satisfy you
To satisfy you

===== Waylon Jennings - Honky Tonk Heroes =====
Low down leavin' sun
Done did everything that needs done
Woe is me, why can't I see
I'd best be leavin' well enough alone?
Them neon light nights, couldn't stay out of fights
Keep a-hauntin' me in memories
Well, there's one in every crowd, for cryin' out loud
Why was it always turnin' out to be me?
Where does it go? The good Lord only knows
It seems like it was just the other day
I was down at Green Gables, a-hawkin' them tables
And generally blowin' all my hard earned pay
Piano roll blues, danced holes in my shoes
There weren't another other way to be
For lovable losers, no account boozers
And honky tonk heroes like me, hey, hey
I was down at Green Gables, hawkin' them tables
Generally blowin' all my hard earned pay
For lovable losers and no account boozers and
Honky tonk heroes like me
Where do we go? The good Lord only knows
And it seems like it was just the other day
I was down at Green Gables, hawkin' them tables and
Generally blowin' all of my hard earned pay, well
For them lovable losers and no account boozers and
Honky tonk heroes like me, yeah

===== Waylon Jennings - Rose in Paradise =====
She was a flower for the taking
Her beauty cut just like a knife
He was a banker from Macon
He swore he'd love her all a his life
He bought her a mansion on the mountain
With a formal garden and a lot a land
But paradise became her prison
That Georgia banker was a jealous man
Every time he'd talk about her
You could see the fire in his eyes
He'd say, "I would walk through hell on Sunday
To keep my rose in paradise"
He hired a man to tend the garden
And keep an eye on her while he was gone
Some say they ran away together
Some say that gardener left alone
Now the banker is an old man
That mansion's crumbling down
He sits all day and he stares at the garden
Not a trace of her was ever found
Now there's a rose out in the garden
It's beauty cuts just like a knife
They say that it even grows in the winter time
And blooms in the dead of the night

===== Dolly Parton - Jolene =====
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm beggin' of you, please don't take my man
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothin' I can do to keep
From cryin' when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene

===== Dolly Parton - 9 to 5 =====
Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from nine to five
Workin' nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmm
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the bossman's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way
Working nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
Nine to five, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
Nine to five, what a way to make a livin'

===== Dolly Parton - Islands in the Stream =====
Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you, with a finetooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah-ah
Making love with each other, ah-ah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong?
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, ah-ah
Sail away
Oh, come sail away with me

===== Dolly Parton - I Will Always Love You =====
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bittersweet memories
That's all I am taking with me
Goodbye, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not what you need
But I will always love you
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all of this, I wish you love

===== Dolly Parton - Here You Come Again =====
Here you come again
Just when I'd begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wondering' how I came to doubt you
All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses
Looking' better than a body has a right to
And shaking' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go
And shaking' me up so
That all I really know
Here I go

===== Dolly Parton - Coat of Many Colors =====
Back through the years I go wandering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mama put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors, every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors that my mama made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me
So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
But they didn't understand it for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch
And I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes
But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be
Made just for me

===== Dolly Parton - Cuddle Up, Cozy Down Christmas =====
I want to cuddle up and cozy down with you
Wrap myself around you
And do what lovers do
Ah, the snow is fallin', passion's callin'
A glass of wine or two
I want a cuddle up, cozy down Christmas with you
Oh, we're not goin' anywhere (No, we better not)
The storm is just too bad (Oh, it's terrible)
There's no gettin' out of here
Old man Winter's seen to that
So here we sit
The candle's lit
And now that we're snowbound, aw
What's to do but love on you?
Cuddle up and cozy down
I wanna cuddle up and cozy down with you (Oh, my)
Nestle up against your skin, do anything that we want to (Ooh)
Makin' love, hug and touch
And steal some kisses, too
I want a cuddle up, cozy down Christmas with you
We could both pretend we're sorry, act so disappointed
But to tell you the truth
Snugglin' with you is all I ever really wanted
Now the fire is blazin', my thoughts are racin'
What we're gonna do (Oh, baby)
When I cuddle up and cozy down with you
What ya say, wanna cuddle? (Haha)
Yeah, I'd love to
Cuddlin' with you, aw
The snow is fallin', passion's callin'
A glass of wine or two
Cuddle up and cozy down in a wonderland for two
Why don't we cuddle up and cozy down Christmas with you
Merry Christmas Dolly
Merry Christmas... Baby

===== Dolly Parton - Hard Candy Christmas =====
Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far
They'll all lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back
Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me, I'll be just
Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down
I'll be fine and dandy
Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew
Maybe I'll just lie low
Maybe I'll hit the bars
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn
Me, I will go on
Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone
And make him mine
Because I'll be fine
(I'll be fine)
Oh, I'll be fine

===== Dolly Parton - Wildflowers =====
The hills were alive with wildflowers
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place
Just a wild mountain rose needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden, one day, set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where we'd go
Just a wild rambling rose seeking mysteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
Mmm...
Dee dee dum, dee dee doh, dee dee dum, dee dee doh
Dee dum, dee dee dee dee doh doh
Dee dee dee dee, dee dum, dee dee doh

===== Dolly Parton - Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That =====
Why'd you come in here looking like that?
In your cowboy boots and your painted-on jeans
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream
Here comes my baby dragging my heart behind
He's drivin' me crazy, who says love is blind?
He's got a wandering eye and a traveling mind
Big ideas and a little behind
Out with a different woman every night
But I remember when he was mine
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans
Waltzing right in here lookin' like that
When you could stop traffic in a gunny sack
Why, you're almost giving me a heart attack
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that
I just can't stand it to see him on the town
He's out slow dancing with every girl around
I'm a soft-hearted woman, he's a hardheaded man
And he's gonna make me feel just as bad as he can
He's got himself a mean streak a half a mile wide
But now he's dancing on this heart of mine
In your high heel boots and your painted-on jeans

===== Dolly Parton - Two Doors Down =====
Two doors down, they're laughin' and drinkin' and having a party
Two doors down, they're not aware that I'm around
But I here I am crying my heart out, feeling sorry
They're having a party two doors down
I think I'll dry these useless tears and get myself together
I think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around
'Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever
I think I'd really rather join 'em two door down, yeah
Here I am, no longer crying and feeling sorry
I can't believe I'm standing here, dry-eyed, all smiles and talking
Making conversation with the new love I have found
I asked him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin'
Down the hall to my place waiting two doors down, yeah
Two doors town, we're not aware that they're around
But I here I am feeling everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, two doors down
Oh, two doors down, oh
Two doors down, we're not aware that they're around
Here we are feelin' everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down, yeah

===== Dolly Parton - You Can't Make Old Friends =====
What will I do when you are gone?
Who's gonna tell me the truth?
Who's gonna finish the stories I start
The way you always do?
When somebody knocks at the door
Someone new walks in
I will smile and shake their hands
But you can't make old friends
You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was you and me, since way back when
How will I sing when you are gone?
Cause it won't sound the same
Who will join in on those harmony parts
When I call your name?
When Saint Peter opens the gate
And you come walking in
I will be there just waiting for you
Cause you can't make old friends
When I am out on the stage all alone
And I hear the music begin
We all know the show must go on
And you and me, will be young again
You and me, will be together again
Cause we both know, we will still be old friends
Not the way we have always been

===== Dolly Parton - Winter Wonderland / Sleigh Ride =====
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No, man
But you can do the job when you're in town"
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, oh, the plans that we've made
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside, the snow is falling
And friends are calling, "Yoohoo"
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
When he says, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No, man
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Woah, oh, baby
Come on and walk with me
Why don't you? (Walk along, talk along, sing along all night)
Oh, baby (Walk along, talk along, sing along all night)
Ooh
Take my hand, come on and walk with me, oh
(Walk along, come along, sing along all night)
(Walk along, talk along, sing along all night)
Why don't you just go with me?

===== Dolly Parton - 9 to 5 =====
Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from nine to five
Workin' nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Nine to five, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmm
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the bossman's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way
Working nine to five, what a way to make a livin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
Nine to five, yeah, they got you where they want you
There's a better life and you think about it don't you
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet
Nine to five, what a way to make a livin'

===== Dolly Parton - Baby I'm Burnin' =====
You look at me that way
I know what your eyes say
Your eyes reflect love and desire
I see that you need me
I need you to please me
You touch me and set me on fire
It's the way that you love me
The way that you touch me
The way that you whisper my name
I cannot resist you
Each time I kiss you
Then everything goes up in flames
Baby, I'm burnin' out of control
Baby, I'm burnin', body and soul
Hot as a pistol of flaming desire
Baby, I'm burnin', you got me on fire
I'm on fire
This red hot emotion
Puts fireworks in motion
It looks like the Fourth of July
There's no use in fighting
This fire you've ignited
Just stand back and watch the sparks fly
Baby, I'm burnin'

===== Dolly Parton - Here I Am =====
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am
If you need a love that's true
Need someone to stand by you
If you need a helping hand, need someone to understand
Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without
I can help you find what you've been looking for
Here I am, come to me, take my hand because I believe
I can give you all the love you need and more
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am
My world is such an empty place
I need someone to fill the space
And here I am, oh here I am, here I am
Because I've got so much love to give
I need someone to share it with

===== Dolly Parton - Love Is Like a Butterfly =====
Love is like a butterfly, as soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside, it flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
I feel it when you're with me, it happens when you kiss me
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside
Your touch is soft and gentle, your kiss is warm and tender
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies
Your laughter brings me sunshine, every day is springtime
And I am only happy when you are by my side
How precious is this love we share, how very precious, sweet and rare
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies

===== Dolly Parton - My Tennessee Mountain Home =====
Sitting on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a straight back chair on two legs, leaned against the wall
Watch the kids a-playing with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowing fireflies when evening shadows fall
In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
Crickets sing in the fields nearby
Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads its wings
And a songbird on a fencepost sings a melody
Crickets sing in the field nearby
Walking home from church on Sunday with the one ya love
Just laughing, talking, making future plans
And when the folks ain't looking, you might steal a kiss or two
Sitting in the porch swing, holding hands

===== Dolly Parton - Those Memories of You =====
Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down
In dreams of you, my body trembles
I wake up and call your name
But you're not there and I'm so lonesome
Without your love, I'd go insane
I close my eyes and you're there with me
Your kiss I feel, your face I see
It's not your lips now that drive me crazy
It's just your haunting memory
I'll always love you, my little darling

===== Dolly Parton - Wrecking Ball =====
We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
Oh, and it slowly turned, you let mе burn
And now, we're ashes on thе ground
But don't you ever say I just walked away
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always love you
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
Yeah, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war (I never meant to start a war)
I just wanted you to let me in (Let me in)
And instead of using force ('Sing force)
I guess I should've let you win
I never meant to start a war (Never meant to start a war)
I just wanted you to let me in (I just wanted you to let me in)
Guess I should've let you win
I came in like a— (I will always love you)
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung (I will always love you)

===== George Jones - He Stopped Loving Her Today =====
He said, "I'll love you til I die"
She told him, "You'll forget in time"
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
But he still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again
He kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
You know she came to see him one last time
Oh, and we all wondered if she would
And it kept runnin' through my mind
This time, he's over her for good

===== George Jones - The Race Is On =====
I feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside
Like my heart sprung a big break
And the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful
That I may never shake
Now you might say that I was taking it hard
Since you wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl
Now the race is on
And here comes pride up the back stretch
Heartache's a-going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on, and it looks like heartache's
And the winner loses all
One day I had ventured in love, never once suspecting
What the final results would be
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning
And finding that you'd gone from me
There's aching and pain in my heart
For the day was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place

===== George Jones - The One I Loved Back Then (The Corvette Song) =====
I stopped off at the Quicksack
For some beer and cigarettes
The old man took my money
As he stared at my Corvette
He said, "I had one just like her, son
In 1963
'Til the man down at the bank
Took her from me"
Oh, she was hotter than a two dollar pistol
She was the fastest thing around
Long and lean, every young man's dream
She turned every head in town
She was built, and fun to handle, son
I'm glad that you dropped in
She reminds me of the one I loved back then
Then I handed him my keys and said
"Here, take her for a spin"
The old man scratched his head
And then he looked at me and grinned
He said, "Son, you just don't understand
It ain't the car I want
It's the brunette in your 'Vette
That turns me on"
I had one that was
Hotter than a two dollar pistol
Lord, she was hotter than a two dollar pistol

===== George Jones - Finally Friday =====
I got a hundred dollars smoking in my billfold
I know I ought to save it but it's burning a hole
Right through my pocket and into my skin
Come Monday morning I'll be broke again
It's finally Friday, I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday, I'm out of control
Forget the working blues and let the good times roll
I got a little sugar baby down the road
She's sitting on a radio and rocking on roll
We'll dance up a storm and later all night
We'll be working on doing all the wrong things right
Monday, I'll be hurting with my head in a vice
Tuesday, I'll be wondering if I'll ever survive
Wednesday and Thursday, I'll be slowly tuning in
Friday, I'll be revving up my motor again

===== George Jones - Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes =====
You know this old world is full of singers
But just a few are chosen
To tear your heart out when they sing
Imagine life without them
All your radio heroes
Like the outlaw that walks through Jessi's dream
No, there will never be another
Red Headed Stranger
A Man in Black and Folsom Prison Blues
The Okie from Muskogee
Or Hello Darlin'
Lord I wonder, who's gonna fill their shoes?
Who's gonna fill their shoes
Who's gonna stand that tall
Who's gonna play the Opry
And the Wabash Cannonball
Who's gonna give their heart and soul
To get to me and you
God bless the boys from Memphis
Blue Suede Shoes and Elvis
Much too soon he left this world in tears
They tore up the Fifties
Old Jerry Lee and Charlie
And Go Cat Go still echoes through the years
You know the heart of country music
Still beats in Luke the Drifter
You can tell it when he sang I Saw the Light
Old Marty, Hank and Lefty
Why I can feel them right here with me
On this Silver Eagle rolling through the night

===== George Jones - The Grand Tour =====
Step right up, come on in
If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone
Over there sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee
And whisper, "Oh, I love you"
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never be the same
Without the love that we once knew
Straight ahead, that's the bed
Where we lay in love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say, "Good morning, dear"?
There's her rings, all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Like she left them
When she tore my world apart
As you leave, you'll see the nursery
Oh, she left me without mercy
Taking nothing but our baby and my heart

===== George Jones - If Drinkin' Don't Kill Me (Her Memory Will) =====
The bars are all closed, it's four in the morning
Must have shut 'em all down by the shape that I'm in
I lay my head on the wheel and the horn begins honking
The whole neighborhood knows that I'm home drunk again
If drinking don't kill me, her memory will
I can't hold out much longer, the way that I feel
With the blood from my body, I could start my own still
But if drinking don't kill me, her memory will
These old bones, they move slow, but so sure of their footsteps
As I trip on the floor and I lightly touch down
Lord, it's been ten bottles since I tried to forget her
But the memory still lingers lying here on the ground

===== George Jones - White Lightning =====
Well, in North Carolina, way back in the hills
Me and my old pappy, and he had him a still
He brewed white lightnin' till the sun went down
And then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around
Mighty, mighty pleasin', pappy's corn squeezin'
Whshhhoooh... white lightnin'
Well, the G men, T men, revenuers too
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin', tryin' to book him
But my pappy kept on cookin'
Well, I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightning 'stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Lightnin' started flashin', thunder started clashin'
Well, a city slicker came and he said "I'm tough
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff"
He took one s-slug and he drank it right down
And I heard him a-moanin' as he hit the ground
Mighty, mighty pleasin', your pappy's corn squeezin'
The G men, T men, revenuers too
But my pappy kept a-cookin'

===== George Jones - Tennessee Whiskey =====
I used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottle
And you brought me back from being too far gone
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And I stay stoned on your love all the time
I looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of the bottle always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
'Cause there nothing like your love to get me high
I stay stoned on your love all the time

===== George Jones - Golden Ring =====
In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the
Wedding rings there on display
She smiles and nods her head
As he says Honey that's for you
It's not much but it's the best that I can do
Golden ring with one tiny little stone
Waiting there for someone to take it home
By itself it's just a cold metalic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a little wedding chapel
Later on that afternoon
An old up right piano
Plays that old familiar tune
Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low with this ring I thee wed
Shining ring now at last it's found a home
In a small two room apartment
As they fight their final round
He says you won't admit it
But I know you're leavin' town
She says one thing's for certain
I don't love you anymore
And throws down the ring
As she walks out the door
Cast aside like the love that's dead and gone
Golden ring...

===== George Jones - Choices =====
Chorus:
I've had choices
Since the day that I was born
There were voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened
No, I wouldn't be here today
Living and dying
With the choices I've made
I was tempted
By an early age I found
I liked drinkin'
Oh, and I never turned it down
There were loved ones
But I turned them all away
Now I'm living and dying
--- Instrumental ---
I guess I'm payin'
For the things that I have done
If I could go back
Oh, Lord knows I'd run
But I'm still losin'
This game of life I play
I wouldn't be here today
With the choices I've made...

===== George Jones - She Thinks I Still Care =====
Just because I ask a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today
She thinks I still care
Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the memory of her lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
But if she's happy thinking I still need her
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer
But how could she ever be so foolish
Oh where would she get such an idea
And just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I saw her then went all to pieces
She thinks I still care, she thinks I still care

===== George Jones - Still Doin' Time =====
Has it been a year, since the last time I've seen her
My God, I could swear it was ten
And the ocean of liquor I drank to forget her
Is gonna kill me but I'll drink 'til then
I've been living in hell with a bar for a cell
Still paying for my cheating crime
Oh, And I've got a long way to go
Still doin' time
In a honky tonk prison
Where a man ain't forgiven
My poor heart is breaking
But there's no escaping
Each morning I wake up and I find
Oh when you're caught cheating twice
It's twenty to life in a place
Where the sun never shines
And tomorrow you're gonna find me right here
Still doin' time...

===== George Jones - The King Is Gone (So Are You) =====
Last night I broke the seal on a Jim Beam decanter
That looks like Elvis
I soaked the label off a Flintstone Jelly Bean jar
I cleared us off a place on that
One little table that you left us
And pulled me up a big ole piece of floor
I pulled the head off Elvis
Filled Fred up to his pelvis
Yabba Dabba Doo, the King is gone
And so are you
'Round about ten we all got to talking
'Bout Graceland, Bedrock and such
The conversation finally turned to women
But they said they didn't get around too much
Elvis said, "Find 'em young."
And Fred said, "Old Fashioned girls are fun."
Later on it finally hit me
That you wouldn't be 'a comin' home no more
Cause this time I know you won't forgive me
Like all of them other times before
Then I broke Elvis's nose
Pouring the last drop from his toes

===== George Jones - I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair =====
I don't need your rockin' chair
Your Geritol or your Medicare
Well, I still got neon in my veins
This grey hair don't mean a thing
I do my rockin' on the stage
You can't put this possum in a cage
My body's old but it ain't impaired
I ain't ready for the junkyard yet
'Cause I still feel like a new Corvette
It might take a little longer but I'll get there
Well, I don't need your rockin' chair
I've still got neon in my veins
I don't need this rockin' chair
Retirement don't fit in my plans
You can keep your seat, I'm a-gonna stand
An Eskimo needs a Fridgedaire
Like I need your rockin' chair
I don't need your rockin' chair (He don't need your rockin' chair)
Your Geritol or your Medicare (Geritol or your Medicare)
I've still got neon in my veins (Still got neon in his veins)
This grey hair don't mean a thing (HIs grey hair don't mean a thing)
I do my rockin' on the stage (Does his rockin' on the stage)
You can't put this possum in a cage (Can't put this possum in a cage)
Yeah, my body's old but it ain't impaired (Well, you know it ain't impaired)
I don't need your rockin' chair (He don't need no rockin' chair)
My body's old but it ain't impaired (Yeah, we all know you ain't impaired)
Uh-huh

===== George Jones - I'm A One Woman Man =====
If you told me that you loved me, I would feel so proud
If you'd let me hold you, honey, I'd holler out loud
I'll never love another, even if I can
Well, come to me, baby, I'm a one-woman man
Won't you let me, baby, just a-kind of hang around?
I'll always love you, honey, and I'll never let you down
I'd climb the highest mountain if it reached up to the sky
To prove that I love you, I would jump off and fly
I'd even swim the ocean from shore to shore
To prove that I love you just a little bit more
Come to me, baby, I'm a one-woman man

===== George Jones - Walk Through This World With Me =====
Walk through this world with me
Go where I go
Share all my my dreams with me
I need you so
In life we search and some of us find
I've looked for you a long, long time
And now that I've found you
New horizons I see
Come take my hand
And walk through this world with me
--- Instrumental ---
Share all my dreams with me
I searched for you so
And walk through this world with me...

===== George Jones - A Picture Of Me (Without You) =====
Imagine a world where no music was playing
Then think of a church with nobody praying
If you've ever looked up at a sky with no blue
Then you've seen a picture of me without you
Have you walked in a garden where nothing was growing?
Or stood by a river where nothing was flowing?
If you've seen a red rose unkissed by the dew
Can you picture Heaven with no angels singing?
Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing?
If you've watched as the heart of a child breaks in two

===== George Jones - Take Me =====
Take me, take me to your darkest room
Close every window and bolt every door
The very first moment I heard your voice
I'd be in darkness no more
Take me to your most barren desert
A thousand miles from the nearest sea
The very moment I saw your smile
It would be like heaven to me
There's not any mountain to rocky to climb
No desert too barren to cross
Darlin', if you would just show a sign of love
I could bear any loss
Take me to Siberia
And the coldest weather of the winter time
And it would be just like spring in California
As long as I knew you were mine
There's not any mountain to rugged to climb
I could bear any loss...

===== Garth Brooks - The Thunder Rolls =====
Three thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in
He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been
And the thunder rolls
Every light is burnin' in a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night
The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls
She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows
She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror, "He won't do this again"
'Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been

===== Garth Brooks - Friends in Low Places =====
Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots
And ruined your black-tie affair
The last one to know, the last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise and the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you, said, "Honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain"
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away
And I'll be okay
Yeah, I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends
In low places
Well, I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's all right, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well, I'll be as high as that ivory tower
That you're livin' in
I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
Oh, I got friends
Yeah, I got friends in low places

===== Garth Brooks - Two of a Kind, Workin’ on a Full House =====
Yeah, she's my lady luck, hey, I'm her wild card man
Together we're buildin' up a real hot hand
We live out in the country, hey, she's my little queen of the South
Yeah, we're two of a kind, workin' on a full house
She wakes me every mornin' with a smile and a kiss
Her strong country lovin' is hard to resist
She's my easy lovin' woman, I'm her hard-workin' man, no doubt
Yeah, our pickup truck is her limousine
And her favorite dress is her faded blue jeans
She loves me tender when the goin' gets tough
Sometimes we fight just so we can make up
Lord, I need that little woman like the crops need the rain
She's my honeycomb and I'm her sugar cane
We really fit together, if you know what I'm talkin' about
This time I found a keeper, I made up my mind
Lord, the perfect combination is her heart and mine
The sky's the limit, no hill is too steep
We're playin' for fun, but we're playin' for keeps
So, draw the curtain, honey, turn the lights down low
We'll find some country music on the radio
I'm yours and you're mine, hey, that's what it's all about
Lordy, mama, we'll be two of a kind, workin' on a full house

===== Garth Brooks - The River =====
You know a dream is like a river
Ever changin' as it flows
And a dreamer's just a vessel
That must follow where it goes
Trying to learn from what's behind you
And never knowing what's in store
Makes each day a constant battle
Just to stay between the shores
And I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So, I will sail my vessel
Too many times we stand aside
And let the waters slip away
Till what we put off till tomorrow
Has now become today
So don't you sit upon the shoreline
And say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids
And dare to dance the tide
Yes, I will sail my vessel
And there's bound to be rough waters
And I know I'll take some falls
But with the good Lord as my captain
I can make it through them all

===== Garth Brooks - Ask Me How I Know =====
You're stubborn as they come, you'll never settle down
You'll always be the one who doesn't stick around
You make all the rules, you're set in your ways
You gotta have your freedom, you gotta have your space
But one day you'll meet the girl you swore you'd never find
Start feelin' things you never felt and spendin' all your time
Tryin' to figure out how she got this hold on you
And when you start to fall, you'll hold onto your pride
Start buildin' up your walls and never let her get inside
You'll push her away 'cause that's all you know how to do
And then she'll leave and you won't beg her not to go
Ask me how I know
Go on and shake your head and tell me that I'm wrong
Say I'm just another fool and this is just another song
But I know how you are, 'cause I know how I am
And I'd give anything to go back and try again
And you best put this song on repeat
Maybe then you won't end up like me

===== Garth Brooks - If Tomorrow Never Comes =====
Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So, I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart?
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelin's for them never were revealed
So, I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel
'Cause if tomorrow never comes
So, tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinkin' of

===== Garth Brooks - That Summer =====
I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needin' somethin' from each other
Not knowin' yet what that might be
'Til she came to me one evenin'
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air, there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night
That summer wind was all around me
Nothin' between us but the night
And when I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much
We had a need to feel the thunder
Ragin' in each other's eyes
We had to ride the heat of passion
I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight, and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancin' with the wind
Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again

===== Garth Brooks - The Dance =====
Lookin' back on the memory of
The dance we shared, beneath the stars above
For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye
And now, I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end, the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance
I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance
Holding you, I held everything
For a moment, wasn't I the king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey, who's to say, you know I might have changed it all
Yes, my life, it's better left to chance

===== Garth Brooks - The Thunder Rolls (Live Long Version) =====
Three-thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in
He's headin' back from somewhere, that he never should have been
And the thunder rolls
Every light is burnin', in a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night
The thunder rolls and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold, on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart, the thunder rolls
She's waiting by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes and he knows that she knows
Another love grows cold, darlin', on a sleepless night
She runs back down the hallway and through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror, "He won't do this again
'Cause tonight will be the last time, she'll wonder where he's been"

===== Garth Brooks - Mom =====
A little baby told God, "Hey, I'm kinda scared
Don't really know if I wanna go down there
From here it looks like a little blue ball
But that's a great big place and I'm so small"
Why can't I just stay here with you?
Did I make you mad, don't you want me, too?
And God said, "Oh, child, of course I do
But there's somebody special waiting for you"
So, hush now, baby
Don't you cry
'Cause there's someone down there waiting
Whose only goal in life
Is making you sure you're always
Gonna be alright
A loving angel, tender tough and strong
It's almost time to go and meet your mom
You'll never have a better friend
Or a warmer touch to tuck you in
And she'll kiss your bruises, your bumps and scrapes
And anytime you hurt, her heart's gonna break
Now when she’s talking to you
Make sure you listen close
Cause she's gonna teach everything
You'll ever need to know
Like how to mind your manners
To love and laugh and dream
And she'll put you on the path
That'll bring you back to me
Come on child it's time to meet your mom

===== Garth Brooks - Unanswered Prayers =====
Just the other night at a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them, the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be
She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if He'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
And just because He doesn't answer doesn't mean He don't care
'Cause some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me, in her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days, there wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what He's doin', after all
And as she walked away, well, I looked at my wife
And then and there I thanked the good Lord for the gifts in my life
And just because He may not answer doesn't mean He don't care
'Cause some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

===== Garth Brooks - If Tomorrow Never Comes =====
Sometimes late at night

So, I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning

About her in my heart?
If tomorrow never comes

And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me

Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelin's for them never were revealed
So, I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

===== Garth Brooks - Papa Loved Mama =====
Papa drove a truck nearly all his life
You know it drove mama crazy bein' a trucker's wife
The part she couldn't handle was the bein' alone
I guess she needed more to hold than just a telephone
Papa called Mama each and every night
Just to ask her how she was and if us kids were alright
Mama would wait for that call to come in
But when Daddy'd hang up she was gone again
Mama was a looker, Lord, how she shined
Papa was a good 'ne, but the jealous kind
Papa loved Mama, Mama loved men
Mama's in the graveyard, Papa's in the pen
Well, it was bound to happen and one night it did
Papa came home and it was just us kids
He had a dozen roses and a bottle of wine
If he was lookin' to surprise us he was doin' fine
I heard him cry for Mama up and down the hall
Then I heard a bottle break against the bedroom wall
That old diesel engine made an eerie sound
When Papa fired it up and headed into town
Oh, the picture in the paper showed the scene real well
Papa's rig was buried in the local motel
The desk clerk said he saw it all real clear
He never hit the brakes and he was shiftin' gears
Papa was a good'n, but the jealous kind

===== Garth Brooks - More Than a Memory =====
People say she's only in my head
It's gonna take time but I'll forget
They say I need to get on with my life
But they don't realize
Is when you're dialin' six numbers just to hang up the phone
Drivin' 'cross town just to see if she's home
Wakin' a friend in the dead of the night
Just to hear him say it's gonna be alright
When you're findin' things to do not to fall asleep
Because you know she'll be there in your dreams
That's when she's
More than a memory
Took a match to everything she ever wrote
Watched her words go up in smoke
Tore all her pictures off the wall
That ain't helpin' me at all
'Cause when you're talkin' out loud but nobody's there
You look like hell and you just don't care
Drinkin' more than you ever drank
Sinkin' down lower than you ever sank
When you find yourself fallin' down upon your knees
Prayin' to God, beggin' him, please
She's more
'Cause when you're dialin' her number just to hang up the phone
Wakin' a friend in the dead of night
'Cause you know she's waiting in your dreams
That's when she's more than a memory

===== Garth Brooks - Rodeo =====
His eyes are cold and restless
An' his wounds have almost healed
And she'd give half of Texas
Just to change the way he feels
She knows his love's in Tulsa
An' she knows he's gonna go
Well, it ain't no woman flesh and blood
It's that damned old rodeo
Well, it's bulls and blood, it's dust and mud
It's the roar of a Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle
He'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats
It's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain
And they call the thing rodeo
Well, she does her best to hold him
When his love comes to call
But his need for it controls him
And her back's against the wall
And it's "So long girl, I'll see you"
When it's time for him to go
You know the woman wants her cowboy
Like he wants his rodeo
It'll drive a cowboy crazy
It'll drive a man insane
And he'll sell off everything he owns
Just to pay to play the game
And a broken home and some broken bones
Is all he'll have to show
For all the years that he spent chasin'
This dream they call rodeo
It's the broncs and the blood, it's the steers and the mud

===== Garth Brooks - Dive Bar =====
Well turn that bottle up and drink it, crank that jukebox up and Hank it
Bartender, pour another round
Here's to our best bad decisions, situation, no conditions
Oh, and memories we all need to drown
So, fill your cup and raise it up
Jump in and join the club
And float this whiskey river reservoir
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar
'Cause up in here you're not the only loved and left her
Lost and lonely one who's ever swam against the tide
Thinkin' this is your oasis, it's the safest of the places
That a broken heart can find to hide
So, here's a toast coast to coast
With a big old adios
To wishes wasted on them fallin' stars
Yeah it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
For some barstool believers, wear our heart out on our sleevers
Just goin' where the neon glows
Yeah, it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
Yeah, we're just never quite belongers, hanger on-ers way too longers
Just buzzin' where the neon glows
Problems, we all got 'em
Let 'em sink down to the bottom
Doesn't matter who or where you are
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end
The water's fine, y'all, so just come on in
To the deep end of a dive bar
Of this dive bar
Talkin' 'bout a dive bar

===== Garth Brooks - Callin’ Baton Rouge =====
I spent last night in the arms of a girl in Louisiana
And though I'm out on the highway, my thoughts are still with her
Such a strange combination of a woman and a child
Such a strange situation stoppin' every hundred miles, callin' Baton Rouge
A replay of last night's events roll through my mind
Except a scene or two, erased by sweet red wine
And I see a truck stop sign ahead so I change lanes
I need a cup of coffee and a couple dollars change, callin' Baton Rouge
Operator, won't you put me on through
I gotta send my love down to Baton Rouge
Hurry up, won't you put her on the line
I gotta talk to the girl just one more time
Hello, Samantha dear, I hope you're feelin' fine
And it won't be long until I'm with you all the time
But until then I'll spend my money up, right down to my last dime
Callin' Baton Rouge
Sweet Baton Rouge
My Baton Rouge
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

===== Garth Brooks - Two Piña Coladas =====
I was feeling the blues, I was watchin' the news
When this fella came on the TV
He said I'm tellin' you that science has proved
That heartaches are healed by the sea
That got me goin', without even knowin'
I packed right up and drove down
Now I'm on a roll and I swear to my soul
Tonight I'm gonna paint this town
So bring me two piña coladas
I want one for each hand
Let's set sail with Captain Morgan
Oh, and never leave dry land
Hey, troubles I forgot 'em
I buried 'em in the sand
She said goodbye to her good timin' man
Oh, now I've gotta say that the wind and the waves
And the moon winkin' down at me
Eases my mind, by leavin' behind
The heartaches that love often brings
Now I've got a smile that goes on for miles
With no inclination to roam
And I've gotta say that I think I've gotta stay
'Cause this is feelin' more and more like home
I gotta have one for each hand
Oh, we'll never leave dry land
Bring... bring... bring me two piña coladas
Let's all set sail with Captain Morgan
Troubles I forgot 'em
And say hello to her good timin' man
Bring me two piña coladas
And we will never leave dry land
I buried 'em in the sand...

===== Garth Brooks - Shameless =====
Well, I'm shameless, when it comes to lovin' you
I'll do anything you want me to, I'll do anything at all
And I'm standin', here for all the world to see
Oh, baby, that's what's left of me, don't have very far to fall
You know, now, I'm not a man who's ever been
Insecure about the world I've been livin' in
I don't break easy, I have my pride
But if you need to be satisfied
I'm shameless, oh, honey I don't have a prayer
Every time I see you standin' there, I go down upon my knees
And I'm changin', swore I'd never compromise
Oh, but you convinced me otherwise, I'll do anything you please
You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down
I can walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from you
I have never let anything have this much control over me
I worked too hard to call my life my own
And I've made myself a world and it's worked so perfectly
But it's your world now, I can't refuse, I've never had so much to lose
Oh, I'm shameless
You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I've never lost anything I've ever missed
But I've never been in love like this
It's out of my hands
I'm shameless, I don't have the power now
I don't want it anyhow, so I gotta let it go
Oh, I'm shameless, shameless as a man can be
You could make a total fool of me, I just wanted to you to know
I just wanted you to know
Oh, I'm down on my knees... shameless

===== Garth Brooks - Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old) =====
This old highway's gettin' longer
It seems there is no end in sight
To sleep would be best
But I just can't afford to rest
I gotta ride in Denver tomorrow night
I called the house but no one answered
For the last two weeks no one's been home
I guess she's through with me
To tell the truth I just can't see
What's kept the woman holdin' on this long
And the white line's getting longer and the saddle's gettin' cold
An' I'm much too young to feel this damn old
All my cards are on the table, with no ace left in the hole
The competition's gettin' younger
Tougher broncs, you know I can't recall
A worn out tape of Chris LeDoux
Lonely women and bad booze
Seem to be the only friends I've left at all
And the white line's gettin' longer and the saddle's gettin' cold
Lord, I'm much too young to feel this damn old

===== Jimmie Rodgers - The Soldiers Sweetheart =====
Once I had a sweetheart
A sweetheart brave and true
His hair was dark and curly
His loving eyes were blue
He told me that he loved me
And he often proved it so
And he often came to see me
When the evening sun was low
But fate took him away
To this awful German war
And when he came to say goodbye
My heart did overflow
He says, "Goodbye, little darling
To France I must go"
He takes the golden finger ring
And he placed it on my hand
Said, "Remember me, little darling
When I'm in no man's land"
He promised he would write to me
That promise he's kept to
And when I read this letter, friend
I pray the war is through
The second letter I got from him
The war was just ahead
The third one, wrote by his captain
My darling dear was dead
I'll keep all of his letters
I'll keep his gold ring, too
And I'll always live a single life
For the soldier who was so true

===== Jimmie Rodgers - Sleep Baby Sleep =====
Sleep, Baby, sleepy
Close your bright eyes
Listen to your mother, dear
Sing these lullabies
While angels watch over you
While she sings to you
Angels watching you

===== Jimmie Rodgers - Ben Dewberry's Final Run =====
Ben Dewberry was a brave engineer
He told his fireman don't you ever fear
All I want is the water and coal
Put your head out the window, watch the drivers roll
Watch the drivers roll, watch the drivers roll
Ben Dewberry said before he died
Two more roads that he wanted to ride
His fireman asked him what could they be
Said the old Northeastern and the A and B
The A and B, he said the A and B
It's the old Northeastern and the A and B
On the fatal morning it began to rain
Around the curve come a passenger train
Ben Dewberry was the engineer
With the throttle wide open and without any fear
He didn't have no fear, he didn't have no fear
He had her runnin' wide open without any fear
Ben looked at his watch, shook his head
We may make Atlanta but we'll all be dead
The train went flyin' by the trestle and switch
Without any warning then she took the ditch
Yeah she went in the ditch, well, she took the ditch
Without any warning, then she took the ditch
The big locomotive leaped from the rail
Ben never lived to tell that awful tale
His life was ended and his work was done
When Ben Dewberry made his final run
He made his final run, he made his final run

===== Jimmie Rodgers - Mother Was A Lady (If Brother Jack Were Here) =====
Two drummers sat at dinner in a grand hotel one day
While dining they were chatting in a jolly sort of way;
And when a pretty waitress brought them a tray of food
They spoke to her familiarly in a manner rather rude
At first she did not notice them or make the least reply
But one remark was passed that brought the teardrops to her eye;
And facing her tormentor, with cheeks now burning red
She looked a perfect picture as appealingly she said:
"My mother was a lady like yours, you will allow
And you may have a sister who needs protection now;
I've come to this great city to find a brother dear
And you wouldn't dare insult me, sir, if Jack were only here."
It's true, one touch of nature, it makes the whole world kin
And ev'ry word she uttered seemed to touch their hearts within;
They sat there stunned and silent, until one cried in shame
"Forgive me, Miss! I meant no harm, pray tell me what's your name?"
She told him and he cried again, "I know your brother, too
Why, we've been friends for many years and he often speaks of you;
He'll be so glad to see you, and if you'll only wed
I'll take you to him as my wife, for I love you since you said:
And you may have a sister, who needs protection now;
And you wouldn't dare insult me, sir, if Jack were only here

===== Jimmie Rodgers - Blue Yodel (T For Texas) =====
T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Thelma, that gal that made a wreck out of me
Oh-del-lay-ee oh, lay-ee eh, lay-ee
If you don't want me mama, you sure don't have to stall, oh Lord
If you don't want me mama, you sure don't have to stall
'Cause I can get more women than a passenger train can haul
I'm gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I'm tall, Lord Lord
I'm gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I'm tall
I'm gonna shoot poor Thelma just to see her jump and fall
Oh-del-lay-ee eh, lay-ee oh, lay-ee
I'm goin' where the water drinks like cherry wine, sing 'em boy sing 'em
Lord I'm goin' where the water drinks like cherry wine
'Cause this Georgia water tastes like turpentine
I'm gonna buy me a shotgun with a great long shiny barrel
Gonna buy me a shotgun with a great long shiny barrel
I'm gonna shoot that rounder that stole away my gal
Rather drink muddy water sleep in a holler log
Than to be in Atlanta treated like a dirty dog

===== Jimmie Rodgers - Away Out On The Mountain =====
I'll pack my grip for a farewell trip
Kiss Susie Jane goodbye at the fountain
I'm going, said I, to the land of the sky
Away out on the mountain
Where the wild sheep grows and the buffalo lows
And the squirrels are so many you can't count them
Then I'll make love to some turtle dove
Way out on the mountain
When the north winds blow and we're gonna have snow
And the rain and the hail comes bouncing
I'll wrap myself in a grizzly bear coat
Where the snakes are vile and the zebras wild
And the beavers paddle on walking canes
Then I'll send my boots with a buffalo hide
Where the whippoorwills sing me to sleep at night
And the eagle roosts on the rocks of spontan
I'll feast on the meat and the honey so sweet

===== Jimmie Rodgers - Dear Old Sunny South By The Sea =====
In my dear old southern home
I was just as happy as I could be;
Where the mocking birds sang at night while they rest
In that dear old sunny south by the sea
There's my mother and dear old dad
When I left I know it made them sad
So I'm going back to that dear old shack
Where I spent my happy days as a lad
Goodbye friends, I'm leaving today
Goodbye friends, I'm going away
I'll be happy and free near our dear old mother's knee
In that little old log cabin by the sea

===== Jimmie Rodgers - Treasures Untold =====
Dreaming of you and your eyes of blue
I've loved you forever it seems
I had longed for you dear, and wanted you near
You are the girl of my dreams
And though I have met you just now
I'll tell you of my love somehow
If I could but win your heart little girl
Then I would have treasure untold
The kisses you gave me in life's sweetest dreams
Are even more precious than gold
I love your sweet face and your dear smiling eyes
How often this story's been told

===== Jimmie Rodgers - Brakeman's Blues (Yodeling The Blues Away) =====
Portland Maine is just the same as sunny Tennessee
Any old place I hang my hat is home sweet home to me
Hey, hey, hey
I went to the depot and looked up on the board
Went to the depot and looked up on the board, hello Memphis
It says, "It's good times here but it's better on down the road"
I'll eat my breakfast here, get my dinner in New Orleans, right on down to Birmingham
Get my breakfast here, get my dinner in New Orleans
I'm gonna get me a mama, Lord I ain't never seen
Where was you mama when the train left the shed? Hey buddy
Where was you mama when the train left the shed?
Standing in my front door wishing to God I was dead
If your house catch a fire, there ain't no water around, sing them blues boy
If your house catch a fire, there ain't no water 'round
Just put my trunk out the window, let the house burn on down
If that's your mama, you better tie her to your side
If that's your mama, you better tie her to your side, hush your noise
'Cause if she flag my train, I'm sure gonna let her ride

===== Jimmie Rodgers - Sailors Plea =====
Dear sweetheart, as I write to you
My heart is filled with pain
For if these things I hear are true
I'll never see you again
They tell me, darlin', that tonight
You'll wed another man
But if you do, I'll tell you true
My boat will never land
You promised that you would wait for me
That nothin' could come between
That in my arms someday you'd be
My wife and lovely queen
I builded you that cozy home
And made a garden there
And planted too with my own hands
Sweet flowers rich and rare
My future hopes are placed in you
You've been my guidin' star
Please write and tell me that you're true
To the sailor who waits afar
Just tell me that you love me yet
Still long to be my wife
I'll return and then we'll wed
And live a happy life

===== Jimmie Rodgers - In The Jailhouse Now =====
I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob
Who used to steal, gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy in town
But I found out last Monday
That Bob got locked up Sunday
They've got him in the jailhouse way downtown
He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playing cards and shooting dice
He's in the jailhouse now
Oh-lay-ee-ee-ee, oh-dee-oh-dee-ee-ee
Ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-dee-del-ee-dee, oh-lay-ee
He played a game called poker
Pinochle, Whist and Euchre
But shooting dice was his greatest game
Now he's downtown in jail
Nobody to go his bail
The judge done said that he refused the fine
Ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-ee, ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-ee
I went out last Tuesday
Met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around
We started to spend my money
Then she started to call me honey
We took in every cabaret in town
We're in the jailhouse now, we're in the jailhouse now
I told the judge right to his face
We didn't like to see this place
We're in the jailhouse now
Ah-dee-oh-lay-ee-ee-dee, oh-lay-ee

===== Jimmie Rodgers - Blue Yodel 2 (Lovin' Gal Lucille) =====
If you ever had the blues you know just how I feel
I'm about to lose my lovin' gal Lucille
I love you woman but I don't like your lowdown ways
You got me in trouble and now I'm servin' days
Write me a letter send it to me by mail
Write me a letter and send it to me by mail
Just send it to me in care of the Birmingham jail
Well, I ain't gonna marry no I ain't gonna settle down
Lord, I ain't gonna marry and I ain't gonna settle down
I'm gonna be a rounder 'til the police shoots me down
You can blow your whistle mama you can toot your horn
You're gonna wake up some morning and find your daddy gone

===== Jimmie Rodgers - Memphis Yodel =====
I woke up this morning
The blues all around my bed
The blue's all around my bed
I didn't have nobody
To hold my aching head
If you don't want me, woman
Give me your right hand
Cause I can find me another mama
And I know you can find a man
I love you, Memphis
You know I love, love you so
Lord, I love you, Memphis
Tennessee, I love you so
And I'd rather be here
Than any other place I know
I've got my ticket
I'm sure gonna ride this train, hey, hey, hey
Lord, I've got my ticket
I'm sure gonna ride this train
I'm goin' some place
Where I won't hear 'em call your name
I'm goin' to the river
Take me a rockin' chair, sing them blues, boy
And take me a rockin' chair
And if the blues don't leave me
I'll rock all the way from here
I don't want you, mama
And I know you don't want me, Lord, Lord, Lord
I don't want you, woman
And I know you don't want me
So I'm goin' to New Orleans
From there on across the sea

===== Jimmie Rodgers - Blue Yodel 3 (Evening Sun Yodel) =====
She's long she's tall she's six feet from the ground
She's tailor made Lord she ain't no hand me down
Oh-di-lay-ee-ay, di-lay-dee-oh, de-lay-ee
She's got eyes like diamonds and her teeth shine just the same
Well she's got eyes like diamonds and her teeth shine just the same
She's got red ruby lips she's got hair like a horse's mane
Everytime I see you woman you always on the street
Everytime I see you you always on the street
You hang out on the corners like the police on his beat
Hey, hey, hey
Won't you tell me mama where you stayed last night
Tell me mama where you stayed last night
'Cause your hairs all tangled and your clothes don't fit you right
I ain't gonna tell you no stories, woman I ain't going to lie
I ain't gonna tell you no stories, mama I ain't going to lie
But the day you quit me woman, that's the day that you die
I hate see this evening sun go down
Lord I hate to see this evening sun go down
'Cause it makes me think I'm on my last go around

===== Jimmie Rodgers - My Old Pal =====
I'm thinking of you tonight old pal
And wishing that you were here
I'm dreaming of the times and the days gone by
When you filled my heart with cheer
I remember the nights when all alone
We sang sweet songs
No other face can take your place
In my heart old pal of mine
The old pals are always the best you see
New friends you can find every day
But they can't fill their places or ever be
Like the old pals of yesterday
I'm wondering just where you are tonight
And if you ever think of me
It would make my weary heart so light sweetheart
Your face again to see
But in my checkered life I find
Nothing comes right it seems
Still you'll always be a pal of mine
Though it may be only in dreams

===== Jimmie Rodgers - I'm Sorry We Met =====
Though you have refused to see me my dear
You'd rather I'd be all alone
Still I can't forget the kisses we knew
And the days when I called you my own
But you found another and you loved him too
My heart is broken I'm sad and I'm blue
I am sorry we met it's so hard to forget
The days that used to be
Though you found another...
And though you weren't true I still think of you
And your memory is so dear to me
But you found another...

===== Jimmie Rodgers - My Little Home Down In New Orleans =====
I never knew that the place i grew
Is the grandest place on earth
Till I roamed around from town to town
But now I know what it's worth
Listen while I tell you about the place I mean
It's my little old home down in New Orleans
Oh-de-lay-ee
In the sunny south where the black oil flows
That's where I long to be
The dixie land where the white cotton grows
Is calling now to me
And soon i'll be in the land of my dreams
I've been east, and way out west
Been around most everywhere
Now I'm headed south for a good long rest
I'll be glad when I get there
All the wonderful things in the world it seems
Are awaiting for me down in New Orleans
The dixie-land where the white cotton grows
And soon I'll be in the land of my dreams
And that's my little old home down in New Orleans

===== Jimmie Rodgers - You And My Old Guitar =====
I could never be lonely
I could never be blue
As I go through life if only
I have my guitar and you
Why should I ever worry
Why should I be sad
We travel along in a hurry
Sharing the good and the bad
Whenever I'm up, you're near me
Giving me happiness
And when I'm down, you cheer me
Nothing is better than this
Here we go, just we three
Oh, how happy we will be
I'll hook my ladder to a silver star
And climb with you and my old guitar
Over the land we wander
First here and there
But I never stop to ponder
If the clouds are dark or fair
In one horse town or city
No matter where we are
I'm happy if I have with me
You and my old guitar
We've travelled the roads together
Leading to lands afar
Singing in all kinds of weather
And strumming my old guitar

===== Jimmie Rodgers - Daddy And Home =====
I am dreaming tonight of an old Southern town
And the best friend that I ever had
For I've grown so weary of roaming around
I'm going back home to my dad
Your hair has turned to silver
I know you're fading too
Daddy, dear ol' Daddy
I'm coming back to you
You made my boyhood happy
But still I longed to roam
I've had my way, but now I'll say
"I long for you and for home"
Dear ol' Daddy, you shared my sorrows and joy
You tried to bring me up right
I know you'll still be just one of the boys
So I'm starting back home tonight

===== Jimmie Rodgers - My Little Lady =====
I had a gal, oh, what a gal, her name was Haydee Brown
I'd take her out, to ride about, when the moon was shining down
We'd sit alone, when we got home, out in the old porch swing
Then the dear little miss, would give me a kiss, while sweetly to her I would sing:
Oh, Haydee, my little lady, I love no one but you
Oh, Haydee, my little lady, won't you love me, too?
We'll get married in June, and have a long honeymoon, then settle down for life
Oh, Haydee, my little lady, won't you be my wife?
I had a gal, oh, what a pal, she left me alone one day
I didn't mind, because I find, they most always do you that way
So, I went about to try n' find out, if another gal I couldn't find
In less than a day, I'd met Sadie Mae, now I hand her the same old line:
Oh, Sadie, my little lady, I love no one but you
Oh, Sadie, my little lady, won't you love me, too?
Oh, Sadie, my little lady, won't you be my wife?

===== Patsy Cline - Ain't No Wheels on This Ship (We Can't Roll) =====
I used to have big money
That was many moons ago
You used to call me honey
Now you call me so and so
Because there ain't no wheels on this ship
And we can't roll, roll, roll
We can't roll, roll, roll
We can't roll
You used to be big papa
The cat of every ball
Now listen, little papa
You done had your big downfall
You used to like my loving
Because you liked my dough
Now you don't want my loving
Because there ain't no dough no more
Well, I'll tell you for the last time
And I've told you this before
If you want to keep your mama
You got to love me more and more

===== Patsy Cline - Always =====
(Always, always, always)
I'll be loving you, always
With a love that's true, always
When the things you plan
Need a helping hand
I will understand, always
Always
Days may not be fair, always
That's when I'll be there, always
Not for just an hour
Not for just a day
Not for just a year, but always

===== Patsy Cline - Anytime =====
Anytime you're feeling lonely
Anytime you're feeling blue
Anytime you feel down-hearted
That will prove your love for me is true
Anytime you're thinking about me
That's the time I'll be thinking of you
So anytime you say you want me back again
That's the time I'll come on home to you

===== Patsy Cline - Back in Baby's Arms =====
I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those lovin' arms
I'm back where I belong
Back in baby's arms
Don't know why we quarreled
We never did before
Since we found out how it hurt
I bet we never quarrel anymore
Thought I didn't need his love
'Til he took it away
Now I'm back where I belong
And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay

===== Patsy Cline - Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home =====
Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home?
I moan the whole night long
I'll do the cooking, honey, I'll pay the rent
I know that I've done you wrong
Remember that rainy eve that I drove you out
With nothing but a fine tooth comb
Yes, I know that I'm to blame and ain't that a shame
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?
Come home, come home, Bill Bailey
Bill Bailey, won't you please come on home?

===== Patsy Cline - Blue Moon of Kentucky =====
I said blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on a-shining
It was on one moonlit night, stars shining bright
Whispered on high, love said goodbye
(Blue moon of Kentucky, blue moon of Kentucky)
Well, it was on one moonlit night, stars shining bright
Whispered on high, your love said goodbye
Left me blue

===== Patsy Cline - A Church, a Courtroom, Then Goodbye =====
The first scene was the church, then the altar
Where we claimed each other, with tears of joy we cried
Our friends wished us luck there forever
As we walked from the church, side by side
The next scene was a crowded courtroom
And like strangers we sat side by side
Then I heard the judge make his decision
And no longer were we man and wife
I hate the sight of that courtroom
Where man-made laws push God's laws aside
Then the clerk wrote our story in the record
A church, a courtroom and then goodbye
We walked from that courtroom together
We shook hands and once again we cried
Then it was the end of our story

===== Patsy Cline - Come on In (And Make Yourself at Home) =====
Come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home
If I had one wish, I wish I could
Go back to my old neighborhood
Where the good folks they all love you as their own
Then I'd go over to my neighbor's house
Knock on the door 'n they'd all sing out
I'd sing their praises long and loud
Cause their all my folks and I'm mighty proud
Of the little old town back home where I was born
I wish that I could hear them say
In the good old-fashioned, friendly way
Well, they don't lock their doors at night
'Cause they all know they're a-doin' right
And the good Lord's bound to have them for his own
If I'd go back to hear them pray
In the little pine church, they all would say
When I was a child of only three
I said my prayers at my mother's knee
And I knew right then from God I'd never roam
When I get my summons on the Judgment Day
I hope I can hear my Savior say
Now, come on in and sit right down and make yourself at home

===== Patsy Cline - Crazy =====
Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue
I knew, you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then someday, you'd leave me for somebody new
Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wondering, what in the world did I do?
Crazy, for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you

===== Patsy Cline - Crazy Arms =====
Blue's not the word for the way that I feel
And the storm brewing in this heart of mine
This is no treasure dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now, you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
But my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll leave with
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
Please take the treasure dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time

===== Patsy Cline - Crazy Dreams =====
I had a dream last night that I held you
And you still seemed as handsome to me
But when I awoke I found you missing
It's just another crazy dream for me
Crazy dreams linger on as I face an empty dawn
With no end to it all can I see
For I've surely reached the end
Lost your love to a friend
Just another crazy dream for me
Once you were mine and we were so happy
I never thought that the end soon would be
But now that you're gone and I'm so lonesome

===== Patsy Cline - Cry Not for Me =====
Cry not for me, my love
When I am far away
There's nothing more to say
Cry not for me
You've found another thrill
And though I love you still
Love is a golden rose
That grows within your heart
Unless the petals fade
And fall apart
Cry not for me, sweetheart
But if a tear should start
Cry not my broken heart
(There is a golden rose)
(That grows within your heart)
Cry not for my broken heart
Cry not for me...

===== Patsy Cline - Dear God =====
I go to church on a Sunday
The vows that I make
I break them on Monday
The rest of the week
I do as I please
Then come Sunday morning
I pray on my knees
Chorus:
Dear God
I know I'm not worthy
But I need you so
Please won't you hurry
And help me turn back from
The path I have trod
You'll never be sorry
--- Instrumental ---
Each day we read in the paper
Of the carryin's on
Of some of our neighbors
We're sinnin', and lyin'
And forgetting the faith
Then we have the nerve
To ask is it too late?
Dear God...

===== Patsy Cline - Does Your Heart Beat for Me =====
Thought we said goodbye
When the moon was high
Does your heart beat for me
I wonder if I still linger
In your memory
When you hear my name
Is the thrill the same
As it once used to be
When you're lonesome, my sweetheart

===== Patsy Cline - Don't Ever Leave Me Again =====
Wake up every morning, heart's full of pain
Looked out the window and it's pouring down the rain
And I cry, "Baby, oh, baby, don't ever leave me again"
I miss your loving, your kisses too
Ain't nothing on earth, I wouldn't do for you
And I cry, "Baby, oh, baby don't ever leave me again"
When rain starts falling and I start calling
Oh baby, how I love you
My heart is crying, I feel like dying
Baby you know, I want you so
Tell me that you're mine till the end of time
And I cry, "Baby, oh, baby, don't ever leave me again
Don't ever leave me again"

===== Patsy Cline - Faded Love =====
As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines, that to me were so dear
I remember our faded love
I miss you, darling, more and more everyday
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love
As I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watched the mating of the dove
It was in the spring time that you said goodbye

===== Patsy Cline - Fingerprints =====
I feel the fingerprints
That you left on my heart
You played a game of love
And then you said we had to part
You left me all alone
And as the tear-drops start
Of sorrow on my heart
I know you didn't mean to be unkind
And hurt me so
And you've made up your mind
But I just thought you ought to know
That when the day is through
I think of only you
I sit alone and dream
And think of things we didn't do
And when the day is through

===== Patsy Cline - Foolin' Around =====
I know that you've been foolin' 'round
On me right from the start
So I'll give back your ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Just come on home and fool around with me
Well I wasn't foolin' 'round the day I said "I do"
But many a night, I wished that I had been a-foolin' too
I know it's foolish taking all this misery
But when it's you, a fool I'll always be
And when you're tired of foolin' round with two or three
Then come on home and fool around with me
So honey, fool around, you know right where I'm at
And don't worry if I'm lonesome, 'cause I'm used to that
Umm, come on home, baby
Come on home, uh huh...

===== Patsy Cline - Gotta Lot of Rhythm in My Soul =====
Come on dad, get with the jive
Let's let em' know that we're alive
Until the break of dawn
We'll yell for more, more, more
Gonna live it up an' tear it down
Get in the groove and paint the town
Gotta lot of rhythm in my soul
Well now, baby, baby, let's go tonight
Together you and me
Baby, baby, when ya hold me tight
Oohee, what ya do to me
The big black hands on the clock
Tell me that it's time to rock
Big bad beat with a crazy bop
When the lights are low and the music's hot
Dance from two to three and then a half past four
When that sun peeks over the hill
I won't stop, I'll be rockin' still

===== Patsy Cline - Half as Much =====
If you loved me half as much as I love you
You wouldn't worry me half as much as you do
You're nice to me when there's no one else around
You only build me up to let me down
If you miss me half as much as I miss you
You wouldn't stay away half as much as you do
I know that I would never be this blue
If you only loved me half as much as I love you
If you only loved me half as much as I loved you

===== Buck Owens - Act Naturally =====
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make the film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm a gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
Biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally
And then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time

===== Buck Owens - Streets Of Bakersfield =====
I came here looking for something
I couldn't find anywhere else
Well, I don't want to be nobody
Just want a chance to be myself
I've done a thousand miles of thumbing
Yes, I've worn blisters on my heels
Trying to find me something better
On the streets of Bakersfield
You don't know me but you don't like me
You say you care less how I feel
How many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?
Spent some time in San Francisco
Spent a night there in the can
They threw this drunk man in my jail cell
I took fifteen dollars from that man
I left him my watch and my old house keys
I don't like folks thinking that I'd steal
Then I thanked him as he was sleeping
And I headed out for Bakersfield

===== Buck Owens - Together Again =====
Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long, lonely nights
Are now at an end
The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again
The gray skies are gone
You're back in my arms
Now, where you belong
The love that I knew
Is living again

===== Buck Owens - Before You Go =====
Oh, you say that you're goin' away and leave me
And you say you ain't never coming back
That you're sick and tired of how I'm doing
And you're gonna head off down the track
But darlin' before you go be sure you know how much I love you
And that I'm sorry for the quarrels that we had
If you leave you're gonna tear my world to pieces
So take it slow be sure you know before you go
--- Instrumental ---
Oh, your wounded pride has blinded your reason
And right now you want to hurt me if you can
The man is waiting here to take you to the station
And you're leaving with your ticket in your hand
So take it slow be sure you know before you go...

===== Buck Owens - Made In Japan =====
My transistor radio comes from far away
And when it's night over here, over there it's-a breaking day
I remember all the good times I had walking in the sand
With a beautiful girl that I met made in Japan
The beauty of her face was beyond my wildest dreams
Like cherry blossoms blooming in the mountains in the early spring
As we walked by the river and she softly took hold of my hand
That's when I fell deep in love with a girl made in Japan
In the dark of night we would lay on Tokyo Bay
And the singing of the birds woke us up at the break of day
Her smiling eyes always seemed to try to understand
All the love in my heart for the girl made in Japan
And when it's night over here over there it's-a breaking day
She cried when she said she'd been promised to another man
That's when I left my heart with the girl made in Japan
Yes my heart will always be with the girl made in Japan

===== Buck Owens - Foolin' Around =====
I know that you've been foolin' around on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
And when you're tired of foolin' around with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me
I wasn't foolin' around the day I said I do
But many a night I wished that I had been a-foolin' too
I know it's foolish taking all this misery
But when it's you, a fool I'll always be
So honey fool around, you know right where I'm at
Don't worry if I'm lonesome cause I'm used to that
Then come on home and fool around with me

===== Buck Owens - I've Got A Tiger By The Tail =====
I've got a tiger by the tail, it's plain to see
I won't be much when you get through with me
Well, I'm a-losing weight and a-turning mighty pale
Looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
Well, I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans
Now, the pace we're livin' takes the wind from my sails
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail
Well, every night, you drag me where the bright lights are found
There ain't no way to slow you down
I'm as 'bout as helpless as a, a leaf in a gale

===== Buck Owens - Under Your Spell Again =====
Chorus:
You've got me under your spell, again
Sayin' those things, again
Makin' me believe that you're just mine
You've got me dreamin' those dreams, again
Makin' those things, again
I've gotta take you back just one more time
I swore the last time that you let me down
That I wouldn't see you if you came around
But I can't tell my heart what's right or wrong
And I've been so lonely since you've been gone
--- Instrumental ---
Well, everybody tells me that I'm a fool
That, I never should have put my faith in you
And way down deep inside I guess I know it's true
But no one else can make me feel the way you do
I've gotta take you back just one more time...

===== Buck Owens - Think Of Me =====
Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
Oh, I'll be thinking of you
Remember all the good times
We shared in days gone by
Remember all the sadness
The day you said goodbye
You said that you were leaving
But you wouldn't be gone too long
With each new day, I hope and pray
That you'll come traveling home
I watch the mailman coming
I listen for the phone
I meet the trains at the station
But I spend my nights alone
But now the waiting is over
And time has set the scene
Yes, God meant me for only you
And he meant you for me

===== Buck Owens - Who's Gonna Mow Your Grass =====
Who's gonna dry your big blue eyes day after day?
Who's gonna jump when you say frog ?
Who's gonna bow and stray
After I've gone away?
Who's gonna kiss ya and who's gonna miss ya?
Who's gonna hold to your hand?
Who's gonna chop your kindlen wood
After I've made new plans?
Hey, who's gonna be your man?
Who's gonna bring you your breakfast in bed?
Who's gonna whisper goodnight?
Who's gonna keep you warm as toast
On those cold winter nights?
And who's gonna be your puppy dog
When I'm a thing of the past?
Hey, who's gonna mow your grass?
--- Instrumental ---
Hey, who's gonna mow your grass?..

===== Buck Owens - Excuse Me (I Think I've Got A Headache) =====
They just don't know how lost I feel without you
My teardrops never see the light of day
I laugh and joke each time they talk about you
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it say
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied
And I better say goodbye before I cry
I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow
I live a lie in all I do and say
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say

===== Buck Owens - Big In Vegas =====
When I was young I left the home
And went away, to Vegas
With my guitar and my dreams
I had to try to play and sing, in Vegas
But my momma told me I was wrong
And she begged me to stay at home
But my will was strong and
I had to make it big, in Vegas
Chorus
They'll put my name up in lights where I play
And the lines out in front will be long
I'll get a standing ovation from the people
When I start to sing my song
When I turn 'em on in Vegas
Well I've played every
Honky tonk and smokey bar, in Vegas
And I guess I don't have
What it takes, for Las Vegas
But my dreams still linger on
Oh my faith is almost gone
But my will is strong and
I've gotta make it big, in Vegas
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la, big in Vegas
La la la la la, big in Vegas...

===== Buck Owens - One of Everything You Got =====
My little boy is a barrel of fun
There's nothing in the world that he ain't done
He wrote old Santa Claus a letter today
A-making sure that it comes this way
I mind my mama and my daddy too
I've done everything that I ought to do
Just so there won't be a mistake
Well here's the list of everything I'll take
I want some of this and some of that
Some cowboy boots and a cowboy hat
A choo-choo train and a baseball bat
A puppy dog and a baby cat
Bring me a transistor radio
A Sting-Ray bike that'll really go
A police car with a light on the top
Bring me one of everything you got
Santa Claus, I promise you
I won't do things that I oughtn't do
Well, I'm-a gonna quit a-acting like a kid
I'm six years old and it's time I did
Last night after he went to bed
Well, I listened in and here's what he said
God bless mama and daddy and me
And God bless Santa on Christmas Eve
I don't wanna put you in a spot
So bring me one of everything you got

===== Buck Owens - Home on Christmas Day =====
Christmas time is coming
Santa's not far away
Things are gonna be humming
Here at home on Christmas day
Well, mama's in the kitchen a-cooking
Daddy's decorating the tree
Big sister's hanging the mistletoe
Little brother's jumping with glee
Yes, now Christmas time is a-coming
Well, Johnny's coming home from the army
Yes, and Susie's coming home from school
Uncle Bill's a-coming up the hill
With a gift for me and you
Oh, Christmas time is a-coming

===== Buck Owens - All I Want for Christmas Is My Daddy =====
A little boy with tear dimmed eyes
With trembling lips he could not hide
Too young to understand why daddy said goodbye
Why, Christmas time is almost here
And daddy won't be home this year
The little boy looked up at mommy and he cried
All I want for Christmas is my daddy
To help me decorate the Christmas tree
Tell old Santa Claus forget about those presents
But don't forget to bring my daddy Christmas Eve
Mommy said if I'd be good
And say my prayers the way I should
Maybe God would help bring daddy back to us
For it won't seem like Christmas day
With my daddy far away
'Cause we miss him so and love him oh so much
No, don't forget to bring my daddy Christmas Eve

===== Buck Owens - A Very Merry Christmas =====
Snowflakes fallin' everywhere
Christmas carols fill the air
Santa Claus is almost here
It's a very merry Christmas
Children playin' in the lane
Echoes at my window pane
Santa Claus is here again
Hang your stocking and jump in bed
Close your eyes and cover up your head
Don't dare peep 'cause if'n you do
Ol' Santa Claus might be watching you
Christmas lights are green and red
Mistletoe hanging overhead
Fills my heart with happiness
And the very merry Christmas
Hang your stocking and jump in your bed
And a very merry Christmas

===== Buck Owens - It's Not What You Give =====
My little boy wrapped the toy in some paper
And he places it underneath our Christmas tree
It was his very favorite toy, he got last Christmas
And to think he give it up and just for me
Then little sister came runnin' with her dolly
And very shyly she climbed upon my knee
She said daddy here's your Christmas present
To you with love especially from me
It's not what you give that really matters
Or how much money you may pay
It's that feeling of giving to others
That's what makes Christmas such a pretty day
--- Instrumental ---
That's what makes Christmas such a pretty day...

===== Buck Owens - Good Old Fashioned Country Christmas =====
We're packing up our clothes and we're going
We're heading out to some place where it's snowing
'Cause for you and for me and the kids there's gonna be
A good old fashioned country Christmas
Some folks enjoy Christmas in the city
To them downtown shopping scenes are pretty
But for you and for me and the kids there's gonna be
Well, we'll chop some fire wood
And pop some popcorn for the Christmas tree
We'll hang our stockings on the mantle
There for old Saint Nick to see
And when our happy holidays have ended
We'll head back to the city quite contented
With our hearts full of peace and with happy memories
Of a good old fashioned country Christmas
And when our holidays have ended
I love a good old fashioned country Christmas

===== Buck Owens - Christmas Ain't Christmas Without You =====
I heard no Christmas carols as I walked down the street
I heard no Merry Christmas from people I'd meet
It seems you've made the whole world blue
Christmas ain't Christmas, dear without you
I talked to a snowman and to my surprise
When I spoke of you, he started to cry
Now that's pretty sad to see a snowman turn blue
No, Christmas ain't Christmas since you went away
And now it seems like just any other day
Yes, you've turned my whole world blue

===== Buck Owens - Santa Looked a Lot Like Daddy =====
Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him
It's not the way I had him pictured, Santa was a-much too thin
He didn't come down the chimney, so mama must have let him in
Well, they thought I was fast a-sleepin', they thought I was tucked in bed
They never thought I'd come a-peepin' or that I'd hear what was said
Santa put his arm around mama and mama put her arm around him
So if Santa Claus ain't daddy, then I'm a-gonna tell on them
Well, Santa looked a lot like daddy, or daddy looked a lot like him
I never saw Dancer or Prancer, I never heard the sleigh bells ring
I never saw the red nosed reindeer like they show on the TV screen
But he sure brought a lot of presents, so Santa Claus, he must have been
Well, he sure looked a lot like daddy and daddy looked a lot like him

===== Bob Wills - New San Antonio Rose =====
Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue, up above
A moonlit path that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor knows only my heart
Call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

===== Bob Wills - New Spanish Two Step =====
Down below the Rio Grande
A senorita held my hand
And sweetly sang an old melody
Without a worry or a care
A rose she gave me from her hair
Then she whispered, "Si, Senor, si, si"
In a cabaret we danced the hours away
Her eyes told more than words dare could say
I told her I had to go
Left her down in Mexico
The band played Spanish Two-Step soft and low
Instrumental Break

===== Bob Wills - Roly-Poly =====
Roly Poly, eatin' corn and taters
Hungry every minute of the day
Roly Poly, gnawin' on a biscuit
Long as he can chew it, it's okay
He can eat an apple pie
And never even bat an eye
He likes everything from soup to hay
Roly Poly, daddy's little fatty
Bet he's gonna be a man someday
Roly Poly, scrambled eggs for breakfast
Bread and jelly twenty times a day
Roly Poly, eats a hearty dinner
It takes lots of strength to run and play
Pulls up weeds and does the chores
And he runs both ways to all the stores
He works up an appetite that way

===== Bob Wills - Take Me Back To Tulsa =====
You see that girl with the red dress on
Some folks call her Dinah
Stoled my heart away from me
Way down in Louisiana
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Little bee sucks the blossom
And the big bee makes the honey
Dark man throws the cotton
White man makes the money
Walk and talk, Susie
We always wear this great big smile
Never do look sour
Travel all over this country wide
Playing music by the hour
I'm too young to wed thee

===== Bob Wills - Cherokee Maiden =====
One night when the moon was bright on the moonlit glade
That is where I found my little Cherokee maiden
The memory of that night of love is lingering here
And I know I never will forget
My little Cherokee maiden, I love her so
Even though we're far apart
I know I'll never be trading my love for her
For anybody else's heart
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee strip
And I'll carry her away with me
And straight as an arrow flies, we'll ride to Paradise
My sweet little chickadee, my little Cherokee maiden and me

===== Bob Wills - Black Rider =====
Black Rider Black Rider
Don't you hear me calling you
You know you're three times seven
You know just what to do
Ride ride ride Black Rider
Set in the saddle and hold the reigns
If you don't ride Black Rider
I'll just have to change your name
Keep your stroke don't get confused
I'll keep these Black Rider blues

===== Bob Wills - Faded Love =====
As I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you, darling, more and more every day
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat I still think of you
And remember our faded love
I think of the past and all the pleasures we had
As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye

===== Bob Wills - Bubbles In My Beer =====
Tonight in a bar alone I'm sitting
Apart from the laughter and the cheers
While scenes from the past rise before me
Just watchin' the bubbles in my beer
A vision of someone who loved me
Brings a lone silent tear to my eye
Oh, I know that my life's been a failure
I'm seeing the road that I've traveled
A road paved with heartaches and tears
And I'm seeing the past that I've wasted
While watchin' the bubbles in my beer
As I think of the heart that I've broken
And all the golden chances that have passed me by
And the dreams that I've made, now are empty
As empty as the bubbles in my beer

===== Bob Wills - Stay A Little Longer =====
You ought to see my blue eyed Sally
She lives a way down on Shinbone Alley
The number on the gate is the number on the door
And the next house over is the grocery store
Stay all night and stay a little longer
Dance all night and dance a little longer
Pull off your coat, throw it in the corner
I don't see why you don't stay a little longer
You can't go home if you're going by the mill
'Cause the bridge washed out at the bottom of the hill
The big creek's up and the little creek's level
I plow my corn with a double shovel
Sitting in the window, singing to my love
The slop bucket fell from the window up above
The mule and the grasshopper, eating ice cream
Mule got sick and they laid him on the beam
Grab your gal and a-pat her on the head
If she don't like biscuits, feed her cornbread
The gals on the big creek about half grown
Jump on a man like a dog on a bone

===== Bob Wills - Time Changes Everything =====
There was a time when I thought of no other
And we sang our own loves refrain
And our hearts beat as one as we had our fun
But time changes everything
And when you left me my poor heart was broken
Our romance seemed all in vain
The dark clouds are gone and there's blue skies again
Yes time changes everything
The time has passed and I have forgotten you
Mother Nature does wonderful things
I guess it is true for me and for you
'Cause time changes everything
Oh you can change the name of an old song
Rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you
So good luck to you and may God bless you
I can't say we won't love again
You have gone your way and I'll go mine

===== Bob Wills - Don’t Let The Deal Go Down =====
Been all around this wide wide world
Done most everything
Played cards with the King and the Queen
And the ace, and the deuce and the trey
Don't let your deal go down, boy
Don't let your deal go down
Don't let your deal go down the drain
'Til my last gold dollar is gone
Where did you get
Those high buckle shoes
And the dress that you wear so fine?
Got my dress from an engineer
And my shoes from a driver in the mine
You call me a bum
When I'm home with you
And it's bad man and tramp when I'm gone
But when I come over the hill
With a hundred-dollar bill
Then it's honey, where ya been so long?

===== Bob Wills - Can’t Get Enough Of Texas =====
Can’t get enough of Texas its range I love to ride
Can’t help but love this country its got me branded and tied
Can’t get enough of Texas it really is a treat
Folks everywhere say howdy when you’re walking down the street
And when that Texas moon gives out and I hear a sweet guitar
I know I wouldn’t trade all this for a round trip to the stars
I found myself a sweetheart way down near San Antone
Can’t get enough of Texas from now on it’s my home

===== Ray Price - If You're Ever Lonely Darling =====
If you're ever lonely darling think of all that I've been through
Long and lonesome nights sweetheart I've waited on you
Say in your mind you have it coming and you know you have to pay
Maybe baby you will learn and change someday
Why oh why did you try to deceive me
You've made me blue sweetheart both night and day
--- Instrumental ---
Maybe baby you will learn and change someday...

===== Ray Price - Talk to Your Heart =====
When you're alone at night with the world locked outside
Have a talk to your heart about me
If you told that it's right that we stay apart
Then let me come in and talk to your heart
Loving you changed my life in just one day
I'm waiting to hear what your heart will say
If your told that it's right that we stay apart
Believe you me there will be happiness when
You open your door and let me come in
So talk to your heart if it can't decide
Remember my own is waiting outside
Waiting alone outside in the dark
So let me come in and talk to your heart

===== Ray Price - Release Me =====
Please release me, let me go
For I don't love you anymore
To waste our lives would be a sin
Release me and let me love again
I have found a new love din
And I will always want her near
Her lips are warm, while yours are cold
Release me, my darling, let me go
(Please release me, let me go)
(To waste our life would be a sin)
So release me and let me love again
Please release me, can't you see?
You'd be a fool to cling to me
To live our life would bring us pain
(Let me love, let me go)

===== Ray Price - I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me) =====
There ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
Ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
Never have I seen a river that's too wide
There ain't no jail tight enough to lock me
Ain't no man big enough to stop me
I'll be there if you ever want me by your side
Love me, if you're ever gonna love me
Never have seen a road too rough to ride
There ain't no rope strong enough to bind me
Look for me, honey you will find me
Any old time you're ready with your charm
I'll be there, ready and a-waitin'
There won't be any hesitatin'
I'll be here if you ever want me in your arms

===== Ray Price - Crazy Arms =====
Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
So please take the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms may hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time

===== Ray Price - You Done Me Wrong =====
Well you tell me that you care but now you're gone you got me cryin'
No use denyin' you done me wrong
If I could look inside your heart then maybe I would know the reason
Why you are leavin' me all alone
Well you know it's not so when you say it's not well you know you lie
I didn't do one wrong thing to you won't you tell me baby
Why you went and left me here so lonely I miss only for I love you
Did I ever make you sad so you be mad and love to hurt me
And desert me for so long
Well you're telling everyone what you done you think it's funny
Well listen honey you done me wrong
Well you know it's not so...

===== Ray Price - Wasted Words =====
Wasted words about an old love affair
You don't love me, you don't care
I've tried so hard to forget
The things that used to be
It's so easy to remember
A few old memories
Just when I think I'm doing fine
Someone speaks your name
Then I have to talk about you
Though I know it's all in vain
An old friend tries to tell me
That I shouldn't be so blue
But that old friend, he just don't know
The love I have for you
Forget the past and have some fun
Go out with someone new
But it's so hard to face it
When I know I can't have you

===== Ray Price - I've Got a New Heartache =====
You're back in town again spreadin' talk around
That I'm still in love with you though you let me down
I hate to admit it but I guess the talk is true
Or else you couldn't make my heart ache the way you do
I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart
That left me for somebody new
And that's why I'm feeling so blue
Why did you turn up again I was doing fine
I'd found another sweetheart to drive you from my mind
I thought that I'd forgotten you but I know that it's not true
I've got a new heartache...

===== Ray Price - My Shoes Keep Walking Back to You =====
I may say that I don't care
Hold up head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through
My heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all
And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you
No matter how much I pretend
I wish I had you back again
For no one else means half as much as you
The day you said goodbye
My world just seemed to die
And I can't forget no matter what I do

===== Ray Price - Curtain in the Window =====
These lyin' lips said, they'd forget
Those same lovin' arms that I miss
This foolish heart that let me part
From those sweet, tender lips, I long to kiss
I hear the ticking of the clock, as it begged me then to stop
Each picture on the wall seemed to cry
And that old rusty gate, I can hear it beg me, wait
While the curtain in the window waves goodbye
Turn around
In memory, I still can see
Two arms, that once held me tight
Oh, how I miss a tender kiss
From those lovin' lips that I kissed goodbye

===== Ray Price - Invitation to the Blues =====
I couldn't sleep last night just walked the floor
Don't know how I stand this anymore
Lonely are the times since I lost you
Received your invitation to the blues
I don't know why you caused me such pain
I just hope I'll never go through this much again
Thanks for sending something I can't use
You took the laughter from this world of mine
Thanks to you the sun will never shine
Walk the floor so much wore out my shoes
Lonely me I don't know what to do

===== Ray Price - City Lights =====
A bright array of city lights as far as I can see
The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabaretes and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget her name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights
The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
The God who put the stars above I don't believe made those lights
Oh it's just a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights
Lights that say forget her love in a different athmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing but a masquarade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights

===== Ray Price - Heartaches by the Number =====
Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
And heartache number two was when you came back again
You came back and never meant to stay
Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score
Every day you love me less
Each day I love you more
Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win
But the day that I'll stop counting
That's the day my world would end
Heartache number three was when you called me
And said that you were coming back to stay
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited, but you must have lost your way
Now I've got heartaches by the number
And the day that I'll stop counting
That's the day my world will end

===== Ray Price - One More Time =====
I wonder what the power is that you hold over me
I never get to love you long just your memory
And I make a vow each time you leave that this will draw the line
Then you come back and just like now I'm falling one more time
One more time my lips may kiss you one more time my arms will hold you
But it won't belong until you're gone with a mem'ry left behind
And I just know that when you go I'll be lonely one more time
Your nearness makes me weaken and I give into you
And I'm doing all the things I said that I wouldn't do
One more time my lips may kiss you...

===== Ray Price - Heart Over Mind =====
I love you so much that I can't leave you
Even though my mind tells me I should
But then you make me think that you still love me
And all my thoughts of leavin' do no good
You've got me, heart over mind, worried all the time
Knowin' you will always be the same
You'll keep hurting me I know but I still can't let you go
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change
Friends tell me they see you out with others
And in my heart I try hard to forget
But then you come home and tell me, you still love me
I still hope there's some chance for us yet
And knowin' you will always be the same

===== Ray Price - Soft Rain =====
Soft rain was falling when you told me goodbye
Thunder and lightning filled my heart inside
The love born in heaven had suddenly died
And the soft rain was teardrops for the angels all cried
If love can be perfect ours must have been
But perfection is always destroyed by men
The rain whispered softly a true love just died
The rain started falling when you told me goodbye
And lightning came crashing from out of the sky
The sky that was bright blue turned slowly to grey
And the angels cried with me as you walked away
If love can be perfect ours must have been...

===== Tammy Wynette - Stand By Your Man =====
Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
Givin' all your love to just one man
You'll have bad times, and he'll have good times
Doin' things that you don't understand
But if you love him, you'll forgive him
Even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him, oh, be proud of him
Because, after all, he's just a man
Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And somethin' warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely
And show the world you love him
Keep givin' all the love you can

===== Tammy Wynette - D-I-V-O-R-C-E =====
Our little boy is four years old and quite a little man
So we spell out the words we don't want him to understand
Like T-O-Y or maybe S-U-R P-R-I-S-E
But the words we're hiding from him now
Tear the heart right out of me
Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E becomes final today
Me and little J-O-E will be goin' away
I love you both and this will be pure H-E double L for me
Oh, I wish that we could stop this D-I-V-O-R-C-E
Watch him smile, he thinks it Christmas or his fifth Birthday
And he thinks C-U-S-T-O-D-Y spells fun or play
I spell out all the hurtin' words and turn my head when I speak
'Cause I can't spell away this hurt
That's drippin' down my cheek

===== Tammy Wynette - Golden Ring =====
In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the
Wedding rings there on display
She smiles and nods her head
As he says Honey that's for you
It's not much but it's the best that I can do
Golden ring with one tiny little stone
Waiting there for someone to take it home
By itself it's just a cold metalic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a little wedding chapel
Later on that afternoon
An old up right piano
Plays that old familiar tune
Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low with this ring I thee wed
Shining ring now at last it's found a home
In a small two room apartment
As they fight their final round
He says you won't admit it
But I know you're leavin' town
She says one thing's for certain
I don't love you anymore
And throws down the ring
As she walks out the door
Cast aside like the love that's dead and gone
Golden ring...

===== Tammy Wynette - I Don't Wanna Play House =====
Today I sat alone at the window
And I watched our little girl outside at play
With the little boy next door like so many times before
But something didn't seem quite right today
So I went outside to see what they were doing
And then the teardrops made my eyes grow dim
'Cause I heard him name a game
And I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little girl say to him
I don't wanna play house
I know it can't be fun
I've watched mommy and daddy
And if that's the way it's done
It makes my mommy cry
'Cause when she played house
My daddy said "goodbye"

===== Tammy Wynette - Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad =====
I've never seen the inside of a bar room
Or listened to a jukebox all night long
But I see these are the things that bring you pleasure
So I'm gonna make some changes in our home
I've heard it said if you can't beat'em join'em
So if that's the way you've wanted me to be
I'll change if it takes that to make you happy
From now on you're gonna see a different me
Because your good girl's gonna go bad
I'm gonna be the swingin'est swinger you've ever had
If you like'em painted up powdered up then you ought to be glad
Cause your good girl's gonna go bad
I'll even learn to like the taste of whiskey
In fact you'll hardly regonize your wife
I buy some brand new clothes and dress up fancy
For my journey to the wilder side of life
Because your good girl'd gonna go bad
Oh yeah your good girls gonna go bad

===== Tammy Wynette - We're Gonna Hold On =====
We're gonna hold on, we're gonna hold on
We're gonna hold on to each other
Life can be rough, sometimes it's kind
A real good life is hard to find
But the best love is the one we've known
And the faith we have between us makes it grow
Some love lives and some love don't
We've got the kind of love we want
It brings us happiness all through the day
And nothing can ever make it go away
Time will tell if you're right or wrong
We know we're right by holding on
And the future is set for you and me
Filled with love the way we both want it to be
We're gonna hold

===== Tammy Wynette - Two Story House =====
(George)
We always wanted a big two story house
Back when we lived in that little two room shack
(Both)
We wanted fame and fortune
And we'd live life the way the rich folks do
We knew some how we'd make it
Together me and you
(Tammy)
With dreams and hopes of things to come
We worked and never stopped
Not much time for you and me
We had to reach the top
We bought that big two story house
And soon became the envy of the town
With all our work behind us
We'd finally settled down
Now we live (yes we live) in a two story house
Whoa, what splendor
But there's no love about
I've got my story
And I've got mine, too
How sad it is, we now live, in a two story house
The house is filled with rare antiques
There's marble on the floor
Beauty all around us
Like we've never seen before
There's chandeliers in every room
Imported silks and satin all about
We filled the house with everything
But somehow left love out
Oh what splendor
How sad it is, we now live, in a two story house...

===== Tammy Wynette - Help Me Make It Through the Night =====
Take the ribbon from my hair shake it loose and let it fall
Laying soft against your skin like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side till the early morning light
All I'm taking is your time help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrow's out of sight
I don't want to be alone help me make it through the night
I it's sad to be alone help me make it through the night

===== Tammy Wynette - Sometimes When We Touch =====
You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
Id rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
In what you say or do
I'm only just beginning
To see the real you
And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides
Romance and all its strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through all the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter
Still trapped within my youth
At times Id like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times Id like to break through
And hold you endlessly
At times I understand you
And I know how hard you try
I watched while love commands you
And Ive watched love pass you by
At times I think were drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again
I want to hold ya till I die
Subsides

===== Tammy Wynette - 'Til I Can Make It On My Own =====
I'll need time to get you off my mind
And I may sometimes bother you
Try to be in touch with you
Even ask too much of you from time to time
Now and then
Lord, you know I'll need a friend
And 'till I get used to losing you
Let me keep on using you
'Til I can make it on my own
I'll get by, but no matter how I try
There'll be times that you'll know I'll call
Chances are my tears will fall
And I'll have no pride at all, from time to time
But they say, oh, there'll be a brighter day
But 'til then I lean on you
That's all I mean to do
Surely someday I'll look up and see the morning sun
Without another lonely night behind me
Then I'll know I'm over you and all my crying's done
No more hurtin' memories can find me
But 'til then
Lord, You know I'm gonna need a friend
'Til I get used to losing you

===== Tammy Wynette - 'Til I Get It Right =====
I'll just keep on falling in love till I get it right
Right now I'm like a wounded bird hungry for the sky
But if I try my wings and try long enough I'm bound to learn to fly
So I'll just keep on falling in love till I get it right
My door to love has opened up more times than in
I'm either fool or wise enough to open it again
Cause I'll never know what's beyond that mountain till I reach the other side
If practice makes perfect then I'm near bout as perfect as I'll ever be in my life

===== Tammy Wynette - There Goes My Everything =====
I hear footsteps slowly walking
As they gently walk across a lonely floor
And a voice that's softly saying
Darling this will be goodbye forever more
There goes my reason for living
There goes the one of my dreams
There goes my only possesion
There goes my everything
As my mem'ry turns back the pages
I can see the happy years we had before
And the love that kept this cold heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of a door

===== Tammy Wynette - Satin Sheets =====
Satin sheets to lie on
Satin pillows to cry on
Still, I'm not happy, don't you see?
Big long Cadillac
Tailor-mades upon my back
Still, I want you to set me free
I found another man
Who can give more than you can
Though you've given me everything money can buy
But your money can't hold me tight
Like he does on a long, long night
You know you didn't keep me satisfied
(Satin sheets) Satin sheets to lie on
(Satin pillows) Satin pillows to cry on

===== Tammy Wynette - My Arms Stay Open Late =====
The baby cries I could almost die from lonesome
The late show's gone and the coffee's on think I'll read some
Somewhere out there my love you share and your thoughts are far from home
But when the lights on Broadway go off and every honky tonk is closed up
My arms stay open late so you'll come home
What you do is wrong but my love stays strong for you
I don't think I'll change a thing at all I might lose you
Though it's almost dawn and you're still not home I'll wait here patiently
The lights to my love never go off and the door to my heart don't close up

===== Tammy Wynette - Forever Yours =====
Forever yours I'll always be please say that you'll give your sweet love to me
Forever yours my love will be I will take care of you say that you love me
I started living the day I found you I love you with all my heart say you love me too
I will stay beside you and I will guide you forever yours please say you are mine
Forever yours I'll always be...
I will take care of you say that you love me

===== Tammy Wynette - You and Me =====
Well we found a life together and it's a gonna last forever
Nothing can hurt me now cause you are mine
We put away all of our sadness we're walking every day with gladness
You and me together all the time
Well she wants to love me a little bit better it's okay I'm gonna let her
When he holds me I can feel he's hard giving love's true and real
Oh now we got a little bitty baby we're happy and we don't mean maybe
Well we'll build a little house in the country and we'll go to church every Sunday
We got each other and we don't need a thing
We start every day with a sweet kiss and that's one thing we wouldn't miss
You and me together making life sweet
Well she wants to love me...

===== Tammy Wynette - Apartment #9 =====
Just follow the stairway
To this lonely world of mine
You'll find me waitin' here
In apartment number 9
Not so very long ago
You walked away from me
And after the all the plans we made
You decided to be free
Loneliness surrounds me
Without your arms around me
And the sun will never shine
I keep waiting in this lonely room
Just in case you change your mind
No the sun will never shine in apartment number 9

===== Tammy Wynette - My Elusive Dreams =====
T: I followed you to Texas
T: I followed you to Utah
G: We didn't find it there, so we moved on
T: I went with you to Alabam'
T: Things looked good in Birmingham
Chorus: (Both)
I know you're tired of followin'
My elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things
My elusive dreams
G: You had my child in Memphis
G: Then I heard of work in Nashville
T: We didn't find it there, so we moved on
G: To a small farm in Nebraska
G: To a gold mine in Alaska
Both: And now we've left Alaska
Both: Because there was no gold mine
T: But this time, only two of us moved on
G: And now all we have is each other
G: And a little memory to cling to
T: And still I won't let you go on alone
Chorus: (Both):
For they're only a fleeting thing
For they're only a fleeting thing, my elusive dreams...

===== Tammy Wynette - A Woman's Needs =====
Where have you been are you still on my side
Is that love or regret that I see in your eyes
How many years have we played out this game
Every time we come close the answer's always the same
I guess some souls get restless under the skin
There's a shortage by half of marrying men
You know that I love you but I love to be free
So tell me what do you want, yeah from a gypsy like me
I need a ring on my finger, champagne on ice
One man to show me the best part of life
Is that what you want
Yeah, that's what I need
A home and a family makes sense for us
A solid foundation built out of trust
Do you think you can find that with someone like me
Two arms to hold you, one place to be
Are just some of the things that a woman needs
I've been shortchanged and cheated so many times
But you're all that I've wanted for all of my life
I've searched for the reasons, known how I've felt
But what can I give you when I can't trust myself

===== Tammy Wynette - No Charge =====
My little girl came up to me in the kitchen this evenin'
While I was fixin' supper. And she handed me
A piece of paper she'd been writing on, and
After wiping my hands on my apron I read it
And this is what it said
For mowing the yard, five dollars
For making my own bed this week, one dollar
Going to the store, fifty cents
Playing with little sister while you went to the store, twenty-five cents
Taking out the trash, one dollar
Getting a good report card, five dollars
And for raking the yard, two dollars
Total owed, fourteen dollars and seventy-five cents
Well, I looked at her standing there expectantly
And a found memory flashed through my mind
And so I picked up the pen and turning the paper over
This is what I wrote
For the nine months I carried you growing inside me, no charge
For the nights I sat up with you doctored you prayed for you, no charge
For the toys food and clothes and for wiping you nose there's no charge
When you add it all up the full cost of my love is no charge
Well, when she finished reading she had great big old tears in her eyes and
She looked up at me and said "mommy I sure do love you"
Then she took the pen and in great big letters she wrote
Paid in full
When you add it all up the cost of real love is no charge

===== Glen Campbell - Southern Nights =====
Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way, hey, yeah
Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky)
Oh, its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin' through your soul
Like the stories told of old
Old man
He and his dog that walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy
Joy
Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Mystery
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
In the Southern skies
They feel so good, it's a frightening
Wish I could (Southern nights)
Stop this world from the fighting
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
(Southern skies)
Have you ever noticed?

===== Glen Campbell - Rhinestone Cowboy =====
I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone
Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know

===== Glen Campbell - Wichita Lineman =====
I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singing in the wire
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman
Is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time

===== Glen Campbell - Gentle On My Mind =====
It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you in the backroads by the rivers of my memory
It keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the backroads by the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clotheslines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a rough'nin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the backroads by the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

===== Glen Campbell - By The Time I Get To Phoenix =====
By the time I get to Phoenix
She'll be risin'
She'll find the note I left hangin'
On her door
She'll laugh when she reads the part
That says I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before
By the time I make Albuquerque
She'll be workin'
She'll prob'ly stop at lunch
And give me a call
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'
Off the wall
That's all
By the time I make Oklahoma
She'll be sleepin'
She'll turn softly
And call my name out low
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her
Though time and time I've tried to tell her so
She just didn't know
I would really go

===== Glen Campbell - Galveston =====
Galveston, oh Galveston
I still hear your sea winds blowin'
I still see her dark eyes glowin'
She was twenty-one
When I left Galveston
I still hear your sea waves crashing
While I watch the cannons flashing
I clean my gun
And dream of Galveston
I still see her standing by the water
Standing there lookin' out to sea
And is she waiting there for me?
On the beach where we used to run
I am so afraid of dying
Before I dry the tears she's crying
Before I watch
Your sea birds flying in the sun
At Galveston

===== Glen Campbell - It's Only Make Believe =====
People see us everywhere
They think you really care
But myself I can't deceive
I know it's only make believe
My one and only prayer
Is that some day you'll care
My hopes, my dreams come true
My one and only you
No one will ever know
How much I love you so
My only prayer will be
Someday you'll care for me
But it's only make believe
My life, I'd give for you
My heart, a wedding ring
My all, my everything
My heart, I can't control
You rule my very soul
My plans, my hopes, my schemes
You are my every dream
Just how much I love you so
That someday you'll care for me

===== Glen Campbell - Try A Little Kindness =====
If you see your brother standing by the road
With a heavy load from the seeds he sowed
And if you see your sister falling by the way
Just stop and say you're goin' the wrong way
You've got to try a little kindness yes show a little kindness
Yes shine your light for everyone to see
And if you'll try a little kindness and you'll overlook the blindness
Of the narrow minded people on the narrow minded streets
Don't walk around the down and out lend a helping hand instead of doubt
And the kindness that you show every day will help someone along their way
You've got to try a little kindness...

===== Glen Campbell - Yesterday, When I Was Young =====
Yesterday, when I was young
The taste of life was sweet
Like rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if
It were a foolish game
The way an evening breeze
May tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed
The splendid things I planned
I always built to last
On weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned
The naked light of day
And only now I see
How the years have ran away
Chorus...
There were so many songs
That waited to be sung
So many wild pleasures
Lay in store for me
And so much pain
My dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time
And youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think
What life was all about
And every conversation
That I can now recall
Concerns itself with me
And nothing else at all
Yesterday, the moon was blue
And every crazy day
Brought something new to do
And I used my magic age
As if it were a wand
And never saw the waste
And emptiness beyond
The game of love I played
With arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit
So quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all seemed
Somehow to drift away
And only I am left
On stage to end the play
Repeat ..
There are so many songs in me
That won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste
Of tears upon my tongue
And The time has come for me
To pay for yesterday
When I was young

===== Glen Campbell - (Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay =====
Sittin' in the morning sun I'll be sittin' when the evening comes
Watchin' the ships roll in then I watch 'em roll away again
'Msittin' on the dock of the bay watchin' the tide roll away
Sittin' on the dock of the bay wastin' time
I left my home in Georgia headed for the Frisco Bay
I had nothin' to live for looked like nothing's gonna come my way
Looks like nothin's gonna change everythin' still remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do so I guess I'll remain the same
Sittin' here restin' my bones this loneliness won't leave me alone
Two thousand miles I roamed just to make this dock my home

===== Glen Campbell - I'll Be Lucky Someday =====
Feeling low, feeling blue
All the troubles come my way
But I just won't worry
I'll be lucky someday
My money's gone, ain't got no friends
More debts than I can pay
Let it rain, oh, let it pour
'Cause it just can't get worse no way
And I know maybe soon
My luck will change someday
The gal I love done said goodbye
She went on her merry way
Maybe I'll get lucky someday...

===== Glen Campbell - Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life) =====
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to do
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life
So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf of good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while

===== Glen Campbell - Sunflower =====
Sunflower, good morning
You sure do make it like a sunny day
Sunflower, fair warning
I'm gonna love you if you come my way
Now, if there's a chance that romance can find you
Better not find you looking the other way
Now, isn't it time you finally take it
Make it so real it steals your breath away
Hey hey hey
You sure do make it like a sunny time
Sun morning, good morning
And someday, child, I'm gonna make you mine
Well, if there's a chance that romance will find you
Isn't it time you finally take it
Make it so good it steals your breath away
It sure do make it like a sunny time
Sunflower, sweet morning
For every time I'm gonna make you mine

===== Glen Campbell - I'm Not Gonna Miss You =====
I'm still here, but yet I'm gone
I don't play guitar or sing my songs
They never defined who I am
The man that loves you 'til the end
You're the last person I will love
You're the last face I will recall
And best of all, I'm not gonna miss you
Not gonna miss you
I'm never gonna hold you like I did
Or say I love you to the kids
You're never gonna see it in my eyes
It's not gonna hurt me when you cry
I'm never gonna know what you go through
All the things I say or do
All the hurt and all the pain
One thing selfishly remains
I'm not gonna miss you

===== Glen Campbell - Country Boy (You Got Your Feet In L.A.) =====
Living in the city
Ain't never been my idea
Of getting it on
But the job demands
That you make new plans
Before your big chance is gone
You get a house in the hills
You're paying everyone's bills
And they tell you that
You're gonna go far
But in the back of my mind
I hear it time after time
Is that who you really are
Country boy
You got your feet in L.A
But your mind's on Tennessee
Looking back, I can
Remember the time
When I sang my songs for free
Take a look at everything you own
But now and then
My heart keeps going home
Talking on the telephone
Setting up another day
Of people to meet
You've gotta do what's right
You've gotta spend the night
Staying in touch with the street
When you're surrounded by friends
They say the fun never ends
But I guess I'll never figure it out
Cause in the back of my mind
Is this what its all about

===== Glen Campbell - Southern Nights =====
Southern nights
Have you ever felt a Southern night?
Free as a breeze
Not to mention the trees
Whistlin' tunes that you know and love so
Just as good even when closed your eyes
I apologize
To anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way, hey, yeah
Southern skies
Have you ever noticed Southern skies? (In Southern sky)
Oh, its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye
It goes runnin' through your soul
Like the stories told of old
Old man
He and his dog that walk the old land
Every flower touched his cold hand
As he slowly walked by
Weepin' willows would cry for joy
Joy
Feels so good
Feels so good, it's frightening
Wish I could
Stop this world from fighting
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Mystery
Like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
In the Southern skies
They feel so good, it's a frightening
Wish I could (Southern nights)
Stop this world from the fighting
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
(Southern skies)
Have you ever noticed?

===== Glen Campbell - Honey Come Back =====
Honey, I know I've said it too many times before
I said I'd never say it again
I guess I shouldn't say anything at all since you're supposed to belong to him
But I just can't let you go without telling you just how much I love you
So that is why I'm gonna say it one more time
Honey, come back I just can't stand
Each lonely day's a little bit longer
Than the last time I held you
Seems like a hundred years ago
Back to his arms and never know
The joy of love that used to taste like
Honey, come back where you belong to only me
Well, I guess that's about all I gotta say
So I'm just gonna take my bags and I'm gonna walk
I know those bright lights are callin' ya, honey
Big fine cars and fancy clothes
But if you ever want somebody to just love ya
And some day you just may, just give me a call-you know where I am
And here is what I'll say
Honey, come back
Where you belong to only me

===== Glen Campbell - Times Like These =====
I, I'm a one way motorway
I'm the road that drives away
Then follows you back home
I, I'm a street light shining
I'm a wild light blinding bright
Burning off all alone
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
I, I'm a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky
To hang the stars upon tonight
I, I'm a little divided
Do I stay or run away
And leave it all behind?

===== Glen Campbell - Dreams Of The Everyday Housewife =====
She looks in the mirror, and stares at the wrinkles that
Weren't there yesterday
And thinks of the young man that she almost married
What would he think if he saw her this way?
She picks up her apron, in little girl fashion
As something comes into her mind
Then slowly starts dancing, remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line
Ah, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere, anytime of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me
The photograph album, she takes from the closet
And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her, now withered with age
She closes her eyes, and touches the house dress that
Suddenly disappears
And just for the moment, she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

===== Glen Campbell - Everybody's Talkin' =====
Everybody's talking at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes in my mind
People stop to starin'
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the fallin' rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off the northeast winds
Sailin' on summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone
Only the echoes of my mind
I won't let you leave my love behind
I won't let you leave
Know I won't let you leave my love behind

===== Eddy Arnold - To Life =====
If I had my life to live over I'd do the same things again
I'd still want to roam to the place we call home
Where my happiness never would end
I'd meet you when school days were onward
And walk through the lanes that we'd knew
If I had my life to live over I'd still fall in love with you
I'd meet you when school days...

===== Eddy Arnold - Anytime =====
Anytime you're feeling lonely
Anytime you're feeling blue
Anytime you feel down hearted
That will prove your love for me is true
Anytime you're thinking 'bout me
That's the time I'll think of you
Anytime you say you want me back again
That's the time I'll come back home to you
Anytime your world is lonely
And you'll find true friends a few
Anytime you see a rainbow
That will be a sign the storm is through
Anytime will be the right time
Anytime at all will do
Anytime you're sure you want only my love

===== Eddy Arnold - I Walk Alone =====
I walk alne where once we wandered
It seems so strange, since you are gone
'Til your turn, I'll stay the same, dear
I'll still be true and walk alone
By stars above, I swear to love you
With all the love I've ever known
While we're apart, you'll always own me
When teardrops start, I walk alone
This lonely night was made to ponder
The golden hours that we once knew
No matter where you are out yonder
I walk alone and think of you
The flame of love is brightly burning
You know that I'm your very own
Each night I pray for your returning
But while you're gone, I walk alone...

===== Eddy Arnold - Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye =====
Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening by your side
Tell me you love me for a million years
If it don't work out, if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye
Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss
Soften my dreams with your sigh
After you've loved me for a million years
If you must go I won't grieve
If you'll just wait a lifetime before you leave
But if you must go I won't say no
Just so we can say that we try

===== Eddy Arnold - Lonely Again =====
You told me that others before you
Were foolish to cause me to cry
And just when I learned to adore you
You kissed one more dream goodbye
And left me lonley again
Just like you found me
Lonely again
No arms around me
Just when I'm sure
That my heart is secure
And my tear drops are dry
With a warm glow inside
And this love of mine
Till the end of the line
That's always the time
That I'm lonely again
You told me you wanted me only
That this time and this love would last
You told me I'd never be lonely
And now you belong to the past
And I'm so lonley again

===== Eddy Arnold - Make The World Go Away =====
Make the world go away
And get it off my shoulders
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away
Do you remember when you loved me
Before the world took me astray?
If you do then forgive me
I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'll make it up day by day
Just say you love me like you used to

===== Eddy Arnold - What's He Doin' In My World =====
What's he doing in my world?
What's he doing holding my world?
If he's not more than just friend
Why were you kissing him?
And what's he doing in my world?
Did you tell him that you're my girl?
If your love is really true
Tell him my world's made for two
Oh, don't let me keep on wondering
Just what you're gonna do
Wondering if the one I love
Loves somebody new
We don't need him in our world
So if it's true he's just a friend
Explain those kisses you gave him

===== Eddy Arnold - The Last Word In Lonesome Is Me =====
The last word in lonesome is me
My heart is as lonely as a heart can be lonely
Too bad what's happened to our good love
Sometimes our best isn't quite good enough
And the last word in lonesome is me

===== Eddy Arnold - Bouquet Of Roses =====
I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
One for every time you broke my heart
And as the door of love between us closes
Tears will fall like petals when we part
I begged you to be different
But you'll always be untrue
I'm tired of forgivin'
Now there's nothin' left to do
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses
You made our lovers' lane a road of sorrow
Till at last we have to say goodbye
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow
With a broken heart you taught to cry
I know that I should hate you
After all you've put me through
But how can I be bitter
When I'm still in love with you?

===== Eddy Arnold - Have I Told You Lately That I Love You =====
Have I told you lately that I love you?
Could I tell you once again somehow?
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you?
Well, darling, I'm telling you now
Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
Every dream I dream is you somehow?
Have I told you why the nights are long
When you're not with me?
My heart would break in two if I should lose you
I'm no good without you, anyhow
And have I told you lately that I love you?

===== Eddy Arnold - Cattle Call =====
The cattle are prowlin', the coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the doggies bawl
Where spurs are a-jinglin', a cowboy is singin'
This lonesome cattle call
He rides in the sun 'til his day's work is done
As he rounds up the cattle each fall
Singin' his cattle call
He's brown as a bearie from ridin' the prairie
And he sings with an old western drawl

===== Eddy Arnold - The End =====
Why does the sun go on shining
Why does the sea rush to shore
Don't they know it's the end of the world
'Cause you don't love me anymore
Why do the birds go on singing
Why do the stars glow above
It ended when I lost your love
I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand, no I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does
Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
It ended when you said goodbye
It ended when you said goodbye...

===== Eddy Arnold - There Goes My Everything =====
There goes my only possession there goes my everything
I hear footsteps slowly walking as they gently walk across a lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying darling this will be goodbye forever more
There goes my reason for living there goes the one of my dreams
As my mem'ry turns back the pages
I can see the happy years we had before
Now the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of a door
There goes my reason for living...

===== Eddy Arnold - Please Help Me I'm Falling =====
Please help me I'm falling in love with you
Close the door to temptation don't let me walk through
Turn away from me darling I'm begging you to
I belong to another whose arms have grown cold
But I promised forever to have and to hold
I can never be free dear but when I'm with you
I know that I'm losing the strenght to be true
Please help me I'm falling and that would be sin
Close the door to temptation and don't let me walk in
For I mustn't want you but darling I do

===== Eddy Arnold - Green Green Grass of Home =====
The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me arms areaching smiling sweetly
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk and there Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
Then I awake look around me at the grey walls that surround me
And I realize that I was only dreaming
There's a guard and there's that sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch I'll touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green green grass of home

===== Eddy Arnold - Crying Time =====
Oh it's crying time again you're gonna leave me
I can see that faraway look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you held me darling
That it won't be long before it's crying time
Oh they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger
If I live to be a hundred years old
Oh it's crying time again you're gonna leave me...
Oh they say that you found someone that you love better
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as sun comes up tomorrow
Crying time will start when you walk out the door
No it won't be long before it's crying time

===== Roger Miller - Dang Me =====
Well, here I sit high, gettin' ideas
Ain't nothin' but a fool could live like this
Out all night and runnin' wild
Woman's sittin' home with a month old child
Dang me, dang me
They oughta take a rope and hang me
High from the highest tree
Woman, would you weep for me?
Just sittin' 'round drinkin' with the rest of the guys
Six rounds bought, and I bought five
And I spent the groceries, and a half the rent
I lack fourteen dollars and a-twenty seven cents
Roses are red and violets are purple
Ssugar's sweet and so is maple surple
Well I'm seventh out of seven sons
My pappy's a pistol, I'm a son of a gun
Well, dang me, dang me

===== Roger Miller - Chug-A-Lug =====
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Make you want to holler hi-de-ho
Burns your tummy, don'tcha know?
Grape wine in a Mason jar
Homemade and brought to school
By a friend of mine 'n' after class
Me and him and this other fool decide
That we'll drink up what's left
Chug-a-lug, so help thyself
First time for everything
Mmm, my ears still ring
4-H and FFA
On a field trip to the farm
Me 'n' a friend sneak off behind
This big old barn where we uncovered
A covered-up moonshine still
And we thought we'd drink our fill
And I swallered it with a smile
Bll-bbb, I run ten mile
Jukebox 'n' sawdust floor
Sumpin' like I ain't never seen
And I'm just goin' on fifteen
But with the help of my finaglin' uncle
I get snuck in
For my first taste of sin
I said, "Lemme have a big old sip"
Bll-bbb, I done a double back flip
(Nonsense syllables), ughhhh

===== Roger Miller - Do Wacka Do =====
I hear tell you're doin' well
Good thing have come to you
I wish I had your happiness
And you had a do-wacka-do
Wacka do, wacka-do, wacka-do
They tell me you're runnin' free
Your days are never blue
I wish I had your good-luck charm
Yeah, I see you're goin' down the street in your big Cadillac
You got girls in the front, you got girls in the back
Yeah, way in back, you got money in a sack
Both hands on the wheel and your shoulders rared back
Root-doot-doot-doot-doot, do-wah
Good things have come to you
(Nonsense syllable interlude)

===== Roger Miller - King Of The Road =====
Trailers for sale or rent
Rooms to let, fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets
I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah, but two hours of pushing broom
Buys a eight by twelve four-bit room
I'm a man of means, by no means
King of the road
Third boxcar, midnight train
Destination: Bangor, Maine
Old worn-out suit and shoes
I don't pay no union dues
I smoke old stogies I have found
Short but not too big around
I know every engineer on every train
All of the children and all of their names
And every handout in every town
And every lock that ain't locked when no one's around
I sing, trailers for sale or rent
Buys an eight by twelve four-bit room

===== Roger Miller - You Can't Roller Skate In A Buffalo Herd =====
You can't roller skate in a buffalo herd
But you can be happy if you've a mind to
You can't take a shower in a parakeet cage
All you gotta do is put your mind to it
Knuckle down, buckle down, do it, do it, do it
Well, you can't go swimmin' in a baseball pool
You can't go swimmin' in a baseball pool
You can't change film with a kid on your back
You can't drive around with a tiger in your car
Well, you can't roller skate in a buffalo herd
You can't go fishin' in a watermelon patch

===== Roger Miller - Engine Engine #9 =====
Engine, Engine No. 9, coming down the railroad line
How much farther back did she get off?
Old brown suitcase that she carried, I've looked for it everywhere
It just ain't here among the rest and I'm a little upset
Yes, tell me Engine, Engine No. 9, coming down the railroad line
I know she got on in Baltimore
A hundred and ten miles ain't much distance, but
It sure do make a difference, I don't think she loves me anymore
I warned her of the dangers, don't speak to strangers
If by chance she find new romance, warmer lips to kiss her
Arms to hold her tighter, stirring new fires inside her
How I wish that it was me instead of he that stands beside her
A hundred and ten miles ain't much distance
But it sure do make a difference, I don't think she loves me anymore
No, I don't think she loves me anymore
I don't think she loves me anymore
Songwriter:  Roger Miller

===== Roger Miller - One Dyin' & A Buryin' =====
Well, I think I finally found me a sure-fire way to forget
It's so simple, I'm surprised I hadn't done thought of it before yet
It's foolproof - well, it's foolhardy, maybe, but who knows
Anyway, here I am walking toward where the cold dark water flows
Cos all it takes is:
One dying and a buryin'
Some crying
Six carrying me
I wanna be free
Oh...I wanna be free
Free from all this heartache and regret
And free from pining for the love I can't forget
The love that once was warm and then just somehow turned to hate
Made my life a prison from which there's only one escape
And that's:
Some cryin'
Six carryin' me

===== Roger Miller - The Last Word In Lonesome Is Me =====
The last word in lonesome is me
My heart is as lonely as a heart can be lonely
Too bad what's happened to our good love
Sometimes our best isn't quite good enough
And the last word in lonesome is me
Life is a desert and love quenches thirst
We all have to hurt sometime this is my first time

===== Roger Miller - Kansas City Star =====
Got a letter just this morning
It was postmarked Omaha
It was typed and neatly written
Offering me this better job
Better job with higher wages
Expenses paid and a car
But I'm on TV here locally
I can't quit, I'm a star
I come on the TV
Grinnin', wearing pistols and a hat
It's a kiddie show and I'm a hero
Of the younger set
I'm the number one attraction
In every supermarket parking lot
I'm the king of Kansas City
No thanks Omaha, thanks a lot
Kansas City Star
That's what I are
Yoodledy you ought to see my car
I drive a big old Cadillac with wired wheels
I got rhinestones on my spokes
I've got credit down at the grocery store
And my barber tells me jokes
Da da da da de da
Baa ba de baa ba ba bu
Baa ba bee
Baa Ba buu buu diddly
Ba da da da da da
I've got credit down at my grocery store
Stay tuned we're going to have a Popeye cartoon in a minute

===== Roger Miller - England Swings =====
England swings like a pendulum do
Bobbies on bicycles, two by two
Westminster Abbey, the Tower, and Big Ben
The rosy red cheeks of the little children
Now, if you huff and puff and you finally save enough
Money up to take your family on a trip across the sea
Take a tip before you take your trip; let me tell you where to go
Go to England, oh
Westminster Abbey the tower of Big Ben
Mama's old pajamas and your papa's mustache
Falling out the window sill, frolic in the grass
Tryin' to mock the way they talk fun but all in vain
Gaping at the dapper men with derby hats and canes
Bobbies on Bicycles, two by two

===== Roger Miller - Husbands And Wives =====
Two broken hearts lonely, lookin' like
Houses where nobody lives
Two people each havin' so much pride inside
Neither side forgives
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the number of husbands and wives
A woman and a man, a man, and a woman
Some can and some can't and some can't

===== Roger Miller - I've Been A Long Time Leavin' (But I'll Be A Long Time Gone) =====
I've been a fool, I've been a foo-ooo-ooool
Forgivin' you each time you done me wrong
I've been a long time leavin' ya, but I'll be a long time gone
Loved you so much, loved you so mu-u-huuuch
I stayed around when I should've moved along
I say hi there high line, hello highway
Here come a big old semi my way
I stick up my thumb, hear the truck come
But the truck goes by and he looks like he's flyin'
And he whoops the big legs on my Levi's
They go woop woop woop woop woop
I've been a fool, I've been a foo-oo-ooool
Forgivin' you each time that you've done me wrong
And he's whoopin' the big legs on my Levi's
Woop woop woop woop woop woop woop woop
Gone gone gone

===== Roger Miller - Walkin' In The Sunshine =====
Walkin' in the sunshine, sing a little sunshine song
Put a smile upon your face as if there's nothing wrong
Think about a good time had a long time ago
Think about forgetting about your worries and your woes
La la la la la de ho
Whether the weather be rain or snow
Pretending can make it real
A snowy pasture, a green and grassy field
Walkin' in the sunshine, singing a sunshine song
Songwriter:  Roger Miller

===== Roger Miller - Little Green Apples =====
And I wake up in the morning
With my hair down in my eyes and she says, "Hi"
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are going off to school, goodbye
And she reaches out takes my hand and squeezes it
And says, "How you feeling, hon?"
And I look across at smiling lips
That warms my heart and see my morning sun
And if that's not loving me, then all I've got to say
God didn't make the little green apples
It don't rain in Indianapolis in the summer time
And there's no such thing as Dr. Seuss, or Disney Land
And Mother Goose is no nursery rhyme
And when myself is feeling low, I think about her face aglow
And ease my mind
Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And ask her if she can get away and meet me
And maybe we can grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doing and she hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late
But she sits waiting patiently and smiles when she first sees me
'Cause she's made that way
And if that ain't not loving me, then all I've got to say
And it don't snow in Indianapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such thing as make believe
Puppy dogs, or autumn leaves, no BB guns

===== Roger Miller - Me And Bobby McGhee =====
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana and was
Blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time and Bobby clappin' hands we fin-
-ally sang up every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord, through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Nothin' left is all she left for me
I bet feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Buddy, that was good enough for me
La da la la la, la da la la la da la
La da da la la la Bobby McGee
La da da la la me and Bobby McGee
La da da la me and Bobby McGee (Hey, ho!)
La da da la me and Bobby McGee
La da da la me and Bobby McGee (Ha, ho, hey, ho!)

===== Roger Miller - Where Have All The Average People Gone =====
The people in this city call me country
Because of how I walk and talk and smile
Well, I don't mind them laughing in the city
But the country folks all say I'm citified
The fighting men they say that I'm a coward
Because I never push no one around
Gentle people call me trouble maker
'Cause I'll always fight and stand my ground
Funny I don't fit
Where have all the average people gone?
Some pious people point and call me sinner
Because to them I've never seen the lights
Other folks think of me as a preacher
I'm just doing what I think is right
The wealthy people think that I am a hobo
Lean and hungry, writing mournful songs
And the poor, poor people think I am a rich man
But really, I'm just trying to get along
It's funny I don't fit
Tell me where have all the average people gone?
And the government has given me a number
To simplify my birth and life and death
And still my woman thinks I'm awful important
Like the moon and the sun and the sea and the sky and breath
Yes, it's funny I don't fit
Songwriter:  Dennis Linde

===== Roger Miller - South =====
Hot afternoon, sometime in June
Sittin' on the front porch waitin' on the moon
Talkin' to my neighbor next door ain't never ever very much fun
Go get my car, and my guitar, ride through town with the top down
Maybe I could buy me some beer, run out and look at the farms
And they call it the South, it's the land of the free
It lost the only war it ever fought in history
But I love the South, it's the land of the free
It's the land of hush your mouth, 'n Joe South
And that's home to me
She was born in '52, she finished in a Mississippi school
And something about her smile that turns you on
She's different, like another world
And you can tell she's not a New York girl
And something about her kiss that takes you home
But she was born in the South, Memphis, Tennessee
She was rich in looks from a poor Memphis family
But she will stay in the South, it's the land of the free
California, I love you, your hills are high and your oceans blue
In LA there's always something to do, and you're never alone
But I like Fall, and I like Spring, I love snow and I love rain
And there's something about LA I can't call home
I guess I'll stay in the South, it's the land of the free
And that's home to me...

===== Roger Miller - Tomorrow Night In Baltimore =====
Her head rolls back and forth
Against the billows of her long black shiny hair
As she contemplates the ecstasy
Of some other love that now she wished was there
If she could only realise that the love I have could beckon her command
Instead of laughing endlessly and pushing back advances with her hands
Every night I see her leaves a nightmare of illusions when she's gone
And it leaves a longing feeling in a man with a pain that lingers on
The gaudy goodbye can't replace the girlish giggle of her sweet hello
But tonight I've made my crumbled mind up that I'll never ever let her go
Too many nights I've watched her tease by shifting all her weight from hip to hip
And with her hands brush back the falling strands that cover up her satin lips
She struts upon the stage and her fallen victims are calling out for more
But she leaves them stranded helplessly and exits to her dressing room door
Tonight I'm gonna take her, I've infiltrated past the guarded door
But she just hurries by me carrying all those scanty costumes that she wore
And she asks a sawed off cigar smoking cat if he would open up the door
Then she told him to load the baggage because they open tomorrow night in Baltimore
God' if I have to crawl, I'm gonna be there tomorrow night in Baltimore

===== Roger Miller - River In The Rain =====
River in the rain
Sometimes at night you look like a long, white train
Winding your way away somewhere
River, I love you, don't you care?
If you're on the run
Winding some place just tryin' to find the sun
Whether the sunshine, whether the rain
River, I love you just the same
But sometimes in a time of trouble
When you're out of hand and your muddy bubbles
Roll across my floor
Carryin' away the things I treasure
Hell, there ain't no way to measure
Why I love you more than I did the day before
Sometimes at night, you look like a long, white train
Roll across the floor, hey
Winding your way away from me
River, I've never seen the sea

===== George Strait - Check Yes Or No =====
It started way back in third grade
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell
Next day I chased her 'round the playground
Across the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote
"Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no"
Now we're grown up and she's my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Ain't much changed, I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room
Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together, she still gets to me
Can't believe it's been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note
Check yes or no

===== George Strait - Amarillo By Morning =====
Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone
Everything that I got is just what I've got on
When that sun is high in that Texas sky
I'll be buckin' at the county fair
Amarillo by morning
Amarillo, I'll be there
They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe
Lost my wife and a girlfriend, somewhere along the way
Well, I'll be lookin' for eight when they pull that gate
And I hope that judge ain't blind
Amarillo's on my mind
I ain't got a dime, but what I got is mine
I ain't rich, but Lord, I'm free
Amarillo is where I'll be

===== George Strait - Carrying Your Love With Me =====
Baby all I got is this beat up leather bag
And everything I own don't fill up half
But don't you worry about the way I pack
All I care about is getting back real soon
A goodbye kiss is all I need from you
'Cause I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me
It's my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
I'll have everything I ever need
On a lonely highway, stuck out in the rain
Darling all I have to do is speak your name
The clouds roll back and the waters part
The sun starts shining in my heart for you
You're right there in everything I do
I'll have everything I'll ever need
I'm carrying your love with me

===== George Strait - Write This Down =====
I never saw the end in sight
Fools are kind of blind
Thought everything was going alright
But I was running out of time
'Cause you had one foot out the door
I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away
Here's some final words from me
Baby, write this down, take a little note
To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down
Take my words and read them every day
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
I'll sign it at the bottom of the page
I'll swear under oath
Cause every single word is true
And I think you need to know
So use it as a bookmark
Stick it on your refrigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel
Where you'll see it for sure
You can find a chisel, I can find a stone
Folks will be reading these words long after we're gone
Oh, I love you and I don't want you to go
Baby, write this down

===== George Strait - Give It Away =====
She was storming through the house that day
And I could tell she was leaving
And I thought, aw, she'll be back
Till she turned around and pointed at the wall and said
That picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
Just give it away
She said, give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where so much love was made
She said, just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway
So I tried to move on
But I found that each woman I held
Just reminded me of that day
Hmm
When that front door swung wide open
She flung her diamond ring
Said, give it away
And I said, now, honey, don't you even want
Your half of everything
So I'm still right here where she left me
Along with all the other things
She don't care about anymore
Mmm, like that picture from our honeymoon
Well, I can't give it away
Where all our love was made
I've got a furnished house, a diamond ring
And a lonely broken heart
Full of love and I can't even give it away

===== George Strait - All My Ex's Live In Texas =====
All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
And sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimples, who now lives in Temple's
Got the law looking for me
I remember that old Frio River
Where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time
Where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
But I always come back to myself
Long before daylight
Therefore I reside in Tennessee
Some folks think I'm hiding
It's been rumored that I died
But I'm alive and well in Tennessee

===== George Strait - Here For A Good Time =====
I'm not gonna lay around and whine and moan
'Cause somebody done done me wrong
Don't think for a minute that I'm gonna sit around
And sing some old sad song
I believe it's half full, not a half empty glass
Every day I wake up knowing it could be my last
I ain't here for a long time, I'm here for a good time
So bring on the sunshine, to hell with the red wine
Pour me some moonshine
When I'm gone, put it in stone, "He left nothing behind"
Folks are always dreaming 'bout what they'd like to do
But I like to do just what I like
I'll take the chance, dance the dance
It might be wrong but then again it might be right
There's no way of knowing what tomorrow brings
Life's too short to waste it, I say bring on anything

===== George Strait - Troubadour =====
I still feel twenty-five most of the time
I still raise a little Cain with the boys
Honky Tonks and pretty women
But Lord I'm still right there with 'em
Singing above the crowd and the noise
Sometimes I feel like Jesse James
Still trying to make a name
Knowing nothing's gonna change what I am
I was a young troubadour
When I rode in on a song
And I'll be an old troubadour when I'm gone
Well, the truth about a mirror
Is that a damned old mirror
Don't really tell the whole truth
It don't show what's deep inside
Or read between the lines
And it's really no reflection of my youth
I'll be an old troubadour when I'm gone

===== George Strait - Blue Clear Sky =====
You swear you've had enough
You're ready to give up
On that little lie they call love
Then out of the blue clear sky
Fallin' right into your hands
Like rain on the desert sand
It's the last thing you had planned
Here she comes a walkin' talkin' true love
Sayin' I been lookin' for you love
Surprise your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear sky
Ain't love a funny thing
One day you're givin' up the dream
And the next you're pickin' out a ring

===== George Strait - Ocean Front Property =====
If you leave me, I won't miss you
And I won't ever take you back
Girl, your memory won't ever haunt me
'Cause I don't love you, and now, if you'll buy that
I got some ocean front property in Arizona
From my front porch you can see the sea
If you'll buy that, I'll throw the Golden Gate in free
I don't worship the ground you walk on
I never have, and that's a fact
I won't follow or try to find you
Yeah, if you'll buy that, I'll throw the Golden Gate in free

===== George Strait - Every Little Honky Tonk Bar =====
Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge
Ice creates the water that's no longer runnin' under it
Stool holds the fool that pours the whiskey on his broken heart
Cigarettes create the smoke that hides the lonesome in his eyes
The jukebox plays Hank, "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"
Dance floor holds the folks trying to forget who they are
And that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar
Friday night, it's a given
I'll be L-I-V-N, livin'
We'll dance on the bar 'til we're sleeping it off in the car
Monday morning, it's a given
I'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'
Neon lights flashing bright 'til you're almost hypnotized
Waitress, short skirt, gets hit on by every guy
Comin' and goin', always rollin' with the flow
Bartender, pour our drinks; Código, do a shot
You think you're tall and bulletproof
Until somebody says you're not
You step outside thinkin' you're gonna show 'em you are
We'll be L-I-V-N, livin'
We'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'
Yeah, that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar

===== George Strait - Love Without End, Amen =====
I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye
Fighting was against the rules and it didn't matter why
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed
Then stood there on those trembling knees and waited for the worst
And he said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us"
He said, "Daddies don't just love their children every now and then
It's a love without end, amen"
It's a love without end, amen
When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and I passed it on to him
I said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
I said, "Daddies don't just love their children every now and then
Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake
If they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in
And then somewhere from the other side, I heard these words again
And they said, "Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
"You see, daddies don't just love their children every now and then

===== George Strait - I Can Still Make Cheyenne =====
Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine
She heard his voice on the other end of the line
She wondered what was wrong this time
She never knew what his calls might bring
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind
He said, "It's cold out here and I'm all alone
I didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home
I know I've been away too long
I never got a chance to write or call
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all
But I'll be home soon and honey is there something wrong?"
She said, "Don't bother coming home
By the time you get here I'll be long gone
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man."
He said, "I'm sorry it's come down to this
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss
But it's alright baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
Gotta go now baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
He left that phone dangling off the hook
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
Then he just walked away
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line
With a little luck he could still get there in time
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say

===== George Strait - Give It All We Got Tonight =====
July moonlight shines
Your pretty little head on my shoulder
Pull over on the side of the road
Oh my God, you're something
Like nothing I've ever seen
If I'm asleep girl, let me dream
Baby fall into my kiss
It should just happen like this
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and
This moment that says it's so right
Cause that's all we have in this life
Drink up this love, baby, give it all we got tonight
Summer honeysuckle
Leaking through a rolled down window
We both know when that seat lays back
Anything can happen
So imagine it'll never end
Just close your eyes and you can see that we are where we're meant to be

===== George Strait - You Look So Good In Love =====
Oh, how you sparkle and oh, how you shine
That flush on your cheeks is more than the wine
And he must do something that I didn't do
Whatever he's doing, it looks good on you
You look so good in love
You want him, that's easy to see
And I wish you still wanted me
He must have stolen some stars from the sky
And gave them to you to wear in your eyes
I had my chances, but I set you free
And now I wonder why I couldn't see
Darling, I've wasted a lot of years not seeing the real you
But tonight your beauty is shining through
And I never took the time to let you know
So before he takes you away, please let me say

===== George Strait - The Fireman =====
Well, they call me the fireman - that's my name
Making my rounds all over town putting out old flames
Hell, everybody'd like to have a what I got
I can cool 'em down when they're smoldering hot
I'm the fireman - that's my name
Last night they had a bad one a mile or two down the road
My buddy walked out and left his woman burning out of control
Well, I was down there in about an hour or so
With a little mouth to mouth, she was ready to go
Got a fire engine red T-bird automobile
In a minute or less I can be dressed fit to kill
I work twenty-four on, twenty-four off
When they get too hot, they just give me a call

===== George Strait - I Got A Car =====
She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up, and I said
"Hey, I know I don't know you but I'd kind of like a shot"
She said, "I saw you coming over, I already thought it over and okay, so now what?"
And I said, "Well, I got a car," she said, "There's something
At least it's a start," I said, "It's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are"
And she said, "Where do you think all this is going?"
I said, "There ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car"
So we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when out of nowhere
She said, "I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kind of wish this day would never end"
She said, "I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin"
I really hadn't thought it through that far
I can't promise you the moon and the stars
We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor said, "You know what's on the way?"
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down
She said, "I think it's time, but all the lines are out"
And her eyes teared up and she said, "What are we gonna do now?"
And I said, "Well, I got a car, she said, there's something
You think it'll start?" I said, "It's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are"
She said, "Are you sure it'll get us where we're going?"
I said, "If there's one thing I know, girl, it's gotten us this far
And I don't mean to hurry, but I'm ready when you are"

===== George Strait - Carried Away =====
I don't take my whiskey to extremes
Don't believe in chasing crazy dreams
My feet are planted firmly on the ground
But darling when you come around
I get carried away by the look by the light in your eyes
Before I even realize the ride I'm on baby I'm long gone
I get carried away nothing matters but being with you
Like a feather flying high up in the sky on a windy day, I get carried away
It might seem like an ordinary night
Same ol' stars, the same ol' moon up high
But when I see you standing at your door
Nothing's ordinary anymore
Carried away

===== George Strait - The Chair =====
Well, excuse me
But I think you've got my chair
No, that one is not taken
I don't mind if you sit here, I'll be glad to share
Yeah, it's usually packed here on Friday nights
Oh, if you don't mind, could I talk you out of a light?
Well, thank you, could I drink you a buy?
Oh, listen to me, what I mean is can I buy you a drink?
Anything you please
Oh, you're welcome, well, I don't think I caught your name
Are you waiting for someone to meet you here?
Well, that makes two of us, glad you came
No, I don't know the name of the band, but they're good
Aren't they, would you like to dance?
Yeah, I like this song too, it reminds me of you and me
Baby, do you think there is a chance
That later on I could drive you home?
No, I do not mind at all
Oh, I like you too, and to tell you the truth
That wasn't my chair after all

===== Conway Twitty - Hello Darlin' =====
Hello Darlin', nice to see you, it's been a long time
You're just as lovely as you used to be
How's your new love, are you happy? Hope you're doin' fine
Just to know it means so much to me
What's that, Darlin', how am I doin'? I'm doin' alright
Except I can't sleep, I cry all night 'til dawn
What I'm trying to say is I love you and I miss you
And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong
Look up, Darlin', let me kiss you just for old times' sake
Let me hold you in my arms one more time
Thank you, Darlin', may God bless you and each step you take
Bring you closer to the things you seek to find
Goodbye Darlin', gotta go now, gotta try to find a way
To lose these memories of a love so warm and true
And if you should ever find it in your heart to forgive me
Come back, Darlin', I'll be waitin' for you

===== Conway Twitty - Fifteen Years Ago =====
I saw a man today who said he'd talked to you
Not so long ago I think a month or two
As my mind raced back in time I prayed
Oh Lord don't let it show
He thinks I forgot you fifteen years ago
Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same
Why did he have to mention your name
I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or so
Takes a mighty strong love to keep a man thinking of a girl
He hasn't seen since fifteen years ago
I've got a lovely wife who thinks the world of me
Promised her my love through all eternity
I've tried hard to make her happy
And so far she doesn't know
I can't shake this thing of fifteen years ago
Takes a mighty long time to get a real love off your mind
I know, I've tried since fifteen years ago

===== Conway Twitty - How Much More Can She Stand =====
There's a devil in my body that I just can't satisfy
Other women haunt me even though I love my wife
It's because I really love her I try to save her heart with lies
But I know she knows, I can see it in her eyes
I tried to stay at home, love only her, play with the kids and watch TV
But then my mind becomes unsure about the kind of love I need
My reasons for cheating, they're as good as lies can be
How much more can she stand and still stand by me
It's so hard for me to call her, I can hardly dial the phone
I did wrong again last night, now, I just want to go back home
She knows that I lied, Lord, she'll cry where I can't see

===== Conway Twitty - I Wonder What She'll Think About Me Leaving =====
I wonder what she'll think about me leaving
I wonder if she'll even know I'm gone
I wonder what she'll think about my leaving
Wish I could be there hidden if she cries
'Cause leaving really won't be worth my trouble
If I can't see the teardrops fill her eyes
Wish I could be there standing by her window
When she finds the note about me being gone
I'm almost sure her coldness never changes
But still I'd like to know it if I'm wrong
I'd like to see her standing all alone
If she hurts at all I'd like to know it happened
I wonder if she'll notice that I'm gone...

===== Conway Twitty - I Can't See Me Without You =====
I can't see you in my arms anymore
And I can't see me without you
Is it day, is it night
Am I losing my sight
Is it over, are we really through?
I can't see me without you to lean on
And I can't see you leaving or gone
I could never see anything you wanted me to
I see the house, you once called your home
And I see the door you walked through
And I see the road you're leaving me on
But I can't see me without you
And I can't see me without you...

===== Conway Twitty - (Lost Her Love) On Our Last Date =====
It's over, our love affair
Too late now I find I care
Her sweet love, never more I'll share
Now she's gone, I'm alone
I was wrong, should have known
Took her home after our last date
I searched for a simple way
To tell her what I had to say
And I kissed her then I turned away
Set her free, foolishly, destiny misery
Tragedy, on our last date
Took my ring from her trembling finger
Brushed the tears from my baby's eyes
Walked away, didn't know
That I'd soon miss her so
I guess I was too young to realize
So blind I couldn't see
How much she really meant to me
And that soon she would always be
On my mind, in my heart
I was blind from the start
Lost her love on our last date

===== Conway Twitty - She Needs Someone to Hold Her (When She Cries) =====
Lord, she needs someone to hold her when she cries
She packed her few belongings left a note and now she's gone
And I can't stand to think of her out there so all alone
As soon as she's gone far enough to know she's out of sight
She'll pull off the highway and she'll cry
And she needs someone to hold her when she cries
Someone who really understands the way she feels inside
When her heart breaks the tears won't stop, no matter how she tries
I don't blame her for leavin' Lord, she didn't want to go
But she thinks I don't love her or need her anymore
I've driven her into a world as dark and cold as ice
With no one there to hold her when she cries
And if she ever loves again I hope that she will find
Someone who'll always hold her when she cries

===== Conway Twitty - You've Never Been This Far Before =====
I can almost hear the stillness
As it yields to the sound of your heart beating
(Bum bum bum)
And I can almost hear the echo
Of the thoughts that I know you must be thinking
And I can feel your body tremble
As you wonder what this moment holds in store
And as I put my arms around you
I can tell you've never been this far before
I don't know what I'm saying
As my trembling fingers touch forbidden places
I only know I've waited
For so long for the chance that we are taking
I don't know and I don't care
What made you tell him you don't love him anymore
And as I taste your tender kisses
And as I take the love you're giving
I can feel the tension building in your mind
(Bum bum bum, uh huh huh, bum bum bum)
And you're wondering if tomorrow
I'll still love you like I'm loving you tonight
You have no way of knowing
But tonight will only make me love you more
(Mmm mmm mmm)
And I hope that you'll believe me
'Cause I know you've never been this far before
(Bum bum bum, bum bum bum, bum bum bum)

===== Conway Twitty - Clinging to a Saving Hand =====
Sing me a song of praise and glory
Help this wandering child to understand
That when I close my eyes in sleep eternal
I'll be clinging to a saving hand
I want you to sing to me about the rock of ages
And sing about eternity so sweet
So that when I take my last breath of life
I'll awaken at my saviour's feet
I want you to tell me about Paul and Matthew
And sing about my dear saviour's birth
And tell about his trials and tribulations
While he walked upon his heathen Earth
Come on and sing me a song of praise and glory
I'll be clinging to a saving hand...

===== Conway Twitty - Steal Away =====
Steal away steal away steal away to Jesus
Steal away steal away home I ain't got long to stay here
I was walkin’ in Savannah passed the church decayed and dimmed
When there slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn
And a sympathy awakened and a wonder quickly grew
Till I found myself environed in a little negro pew
Out at front a young couple sat in sorrow and nearly wild
On the altar was a coffin and in the coffin was a child
Rows of sad old negro preacher at a little wooden desk
With a manner grandly offеred in the countless grotеsque
And he said now don't be weepin' for this pretty bit of clay
For the little boy who lived there why he done up and run away
But he is doin’ very finly and he appreaciated your love
But he's sure enough father want him in the large house up above
Now he didn't give you that baby no not by a hundred thousand miles
He just thought you need some sunshine and he lend it to you for a while
And he let you love and keep till your hearts was bigger grown
And these silver tears you've shed why they're just interest on the lawn
So my poor dejected mourners let your hearts with Jesus rest
And don't go criticize no one that knows the best
He give us many comforts and he has the right to take away
To the Lord be praised in glory now and ever let us pray
My Lord calls me he calls me by the thunder the trumpet sounds within my soul
I ain't got long to stay here

===== Conway Twitty - Honky Tonk Angel =====
That was the last time you've kissed me
And I don't mean a touch now and then
It's been a long time since you felt like my woman
And even longer since I felt like your man
So tell me if you think it's over
And I'll leave it up to you how it ends
And if there's someone who wants to love you can give him
Well there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in
We've been livin' a life for so long now
How much more do you think we can stand
There's an old friend out there and she's waiting
Lord she's happy just holding my hand
And if he still wants the love you can give him
Yeah there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in

===== Conway Twitty - I'm Not Through Loving You Yet =====
You came to me, and you threw me, with a simple goodbye
I begged your forgiveness but you won't even try
You just say that its all over, that you'll soon forget
But I still remember, I'm not through loving you yet
No, I'm not through loving you
I just need some time
To make the plans that we made come true
Now, you are tired of trying and soon I'll regret
That I couldn't hold you
I'm not through loving you yet
--- Instrumental ---
But your tired of trying and soon I'll regret
I'm not through loving you yet..

===== Conway Twitty - Linda on My Mind =====
Now I'm lying here with Linda on my mind
And next to me, my soon-to-be, the one I left behind
And Lord it's killing me to see her cry
She knows I'm lying here beside her with Linda on my mind
Yes I know that I once loved her
And I placed no one above her
And I never thought I'd ever set her free
But it just wasn't in my plans
The way that Linda squeezed my hand
The first time that I held her close
As she danced with me
She said, "I've loved you for a long time
But you're married to a friend of mine
And I've tried hard to never let it show
But my love for you is stronger
I can't hide it any longer"
And so I thought I'd better let you know

===== Conway Twitty - This Time I've Hurt Her More Than She Loves Me =====
She wore that fallin' out of love, look
I even swore by the good book
Still the last lie I told her
Was the one she couldn't believe
No more crying on her shoulder
She won't even let me hold her
And this time I've hurt her more
Than she loves me
I've been too busy drinking
She's been too busy thinking
'Bout the kind of love she needs
And the man she never sees
But Lord, she's already stood more
Than I was ever good for
Lord, this time I've hurt her more
Than she loves me...

===== Conway Twitty - Play Guitar Play =====
Play, guitar play
Take me back to yesterday
Let me see, cotton growing, in the fields
Let me hear, my momma calling
Look a-yonder ya'll who's coming
Down the road, he's a coming home
But they know I never will
I left them living with that awful thing I done
I didn't tell them I just packed my clothes and run
Help me through another day
Help me make another dollar, before I go
We got time, for one more song
Then we'll have to move along
Another town, another crowd
Lord, I wonder if they know
Can they read between the lines in my song
As I sing about a good boy that's went wrong
Guitar we got years to kill
We got to climb that distant hill
I wonder if they think of me
(Guitar play)...

===== Conway Twitty - I've Already Loved You in My Mind =====
I thought I've never seen a girl like her in here before
And I could see her watching me as I walk across the floor
I asked her if she'd like to dance
When the band starts up again
She said I never danced with strangers
I don't even know your name
I said we're not exactly strangers, you and I
My thoughts were running wild and free
As I watched you tonight
Just think about it and you'll find
We're not exactly strangers
I've already loved you in my mind
The band started playing a slow moving song
She got up and easily moved into my arms
I kept on saying the things a girl likes to hear
And when the dance was over she whispered in my ear
She said we're not exactly strangers, you and I
While you held me tight
I thought about it and I find
I've already loved you in my mind...

===== Conway Twitty - Georgia Keeps Pulling on My Ring =====
Georgia, sweet Georgia, keeps pulling on my ring
Most men would give their right arm or anything they own
To have a woman just like you to be waiting when they come home
But the devil made me cheat on you one too many times
And honey, I'm sorry, but she left Heaven on my mind
I need her and I love her Lord, she's a sweet and precious thing
Her sweet and easy loving, Lord, beats all I've ever seen
Georgia, sweet sweet Georgia, keeps pulling on my ring
I didn't wanna fall in love with anybody else
But when I tasted Heaven, Lord, I just couldn't help myself
I pray someday that you'll forget and forgive me for all these things
I just can't seem to love you with Georgia pulling on my ring

===== Conway Twitty - Don't Call Him a Cowboy =====
So you came from New York city
And you want to see the sights
You've heard all about those cowboys
And those crazy Texas nights
I see you've got your eye on something
Leaning on the bar
But the toughest ride he's ever had
Was in his foreign car
Chorus:
So don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride
'Cause a Stetson hat and those fancy boots
Don't tell ya what's inside no
And if he ain't good in the saddle
Lord, you won't be satisfied
He's the Hollywood idea
Of the wild andd wooly west
In his french designer blue jeans
And his custom tailored vest
You think he's the real thing
But I think you oughta know
He can't even make it through
A one night rodeo. No
Don't tell ya what's inside. no
Don't call him a cowboy
Until you've seen him ride...

===== Conway Twitty - Rest Your Love on Me =====
Maybe you don't know me any more than I know you
And I wouldn't blame you if you walked away
I've been watching you all evening with those teardrops in your eyes
And it touches me much more than I can say
You know I hate to think that someone could have hurt someone like you
And if I was him I'd be right by your side
Lay your troubles on my shoulder
Put your worries in my pocket
Rest your love on me a while
Saw you in the corner from the moment I walked in
Saw your lonely face across the room
No I won't forget you and the way it could have been
Why'd you have to leave so soon
You know I hate to think there's someone you loved instead of me
'Cause at times like this I'd be right by your side

===== Lefty Frizzell - I Love You A Thousand Ways =====
I love you, I'll prove it in days to come
I swear it's true, darlin', you're the only one
I think of you, of the past and all our fun
You're my darling, you've been true
I should have been good to you
You're the one that's in my heart
While we're apart
I'll be true, I'll prove it to you someday
My love is for you, in my heart, you'll always stay
I've been so blue and lonesome all these days
I love you, I'll prove it a thousand ways
I'll be nice and sweet to you
And no more will you be blue
I'll prove I love you every day
All kinds of ways
Darlin', please wait, please wait until I'm free
There'll be a change, a great change made in me
I'll be true, there'll be no more blue days

===== Lefty Frizzell - Look What Thoughts Will Do =====
Once I thought I loved just you
And I thought you loved me too
But just look what thoughts will do
For today you say we're through
Now another wears the crown
And you think that you have found
Just what makes your world go round
Watch those thoughts, they'll get you down
If within your future years
Your new love should bring you tears
Then you'll think of me I'm sure
But those thoughts won't help you dear
Thought I'd build a home for two
Just a home for me and you
Thought we'd have some kiddies too
Now I know just how you feel
That your love was never real
Guess to you I don't appeal
So we'll just forget the deal
So goodbye and here's to you
And I'm happy through and through
Yes you thought that I'd be blue

===== Lefty Frizzell - I Want To Be With You Always =====
I lose my blues
Honey, when I'm with you
No one else can do
You're in my heart to stay
But when I'm gone
And I'm all alone
I'll be singing this song
I wanna be with you, always
I'd be happy, dear
If you could only be here
And always be near
Forever and a day
Then we'd travel far
To some big shinin' star
Just you and my guitar
And stay there, sweetheart, for always
I hope you feel the same
You really want my name
Well, you'll be the one who's to blame
If it works out wrong that day
'Cause my love is true
My love is only for you
I'll never be blue
If I can be with you always

===== Lefty Frizzell - Always Late (With Your Kisses) =====
Always late (Always late) with your kisses (Always late)
Won't you come to my arms sweet darling and stay
Why oh why do you want to do me this way
How long do you think I can wait
When you know you're always late
(You're always late, with your kisses)
Why why why do you want to do me this way
(Always late)

===== Lefty Frizzell - Mom And Dad's Waltz =====
I'd walk for miles, cry or smile
For my mama and daddy
I want them
I want them to know
How I feel, my love is real
I love them so
In my heart, joy tears starts
'Cause I'm happy
And I pray every day
For mom and pappy
And each night
I'd fight in wars, do all the chores
I want them to live on
'Til they're called
I'd work and slave and never rave
To my mama and daddy
Because I know
I owe them my all

===== Lefty Frizzell - Travellin' Blues =====
I had a dream last night
I thought my good gal had gone
Well, I woke up this morning
She really had done me wrong
I know it's not fair
But my good gal has done caught air
I'm goin' away
Leaving today
I'm gonna bring my baby back
If that eight wheel driver don't jump the railroad track
I'll take her from that man
Gonna bring her home if I can
My gal's been triflin' 'round
About a week I know
Several of my friends
Just told me so and so
She's found new man
And now I can understand
So I'm goin' away
Well, it's true, my baby's gone
I know it won't be long
We'll both be on that train
My baby's coming home again
She's been triflin' 'round
But now she has turned him down
Yeah I'm goin' away

===== Lefty Frizzell - I'm An Old, Old Man (Tryin' To Live While I Can) =====
Said an old man to a good-looking girl
Well I've been around this big wide world
That home on the hill well honey that's mine
I got the money and got lots of time
I'm not too old to cut the mustard anymore
I can still get around like I did before
So come along with me my sweet sweet hon'
I'm an old old man searching for fun
What I can do now most young men can't
There's not a town that this old boy can't paint
I can make all the clubs just any old night
I may feel little older but I'm doing alright
Don't take me wrong I just wanna have fun
Have someone along to help me spend my mon'
'Cause you don't live but once so please understand
That I'm an old old man trying to live while I can
I got money to spend, a new car to drive
And I won't give in we'll have fun man alive
And we'll honky tonk all the night long
I'm just an old man that don't wanna go home

===== Lefty Frizzell - Just Can't Live That Fast (Any More) =====
Hey, I was out last night started a fight
Feelin' bad this morning and a-lookin' a sight
Stumblin' and a-fumblin' and a-feelin' for the knob of my door
'Cause I just can't live that fast anymore
Well, I remember back when the fun begin
Noon the next day 'fore I come in
And the morning never bothered me after the night before
But I just can't live that fast anymore
Well, take a look at me and you can see
That that fast livin' brings misery
Just a messed up rick at the end with blood-shot eyes
Man, you just can't live that fast and get by
Take my advicе think it over twice
Live rеal slow and be real nice
You better heed this warning I'm a-givin' you in this song
'Cause you just can't live that fast very long

===== Lefty Frizzell - The Long Black Veil =====
Ten years ago, on a cold, dark night
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me
The judge said, "Son what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die"
I spoke not a word, though it meant my life
For I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
The scaffold was high and eternity nears
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

===== Lefty Frizzell - Saginaw, Michigan =====
I was born in Saginaw, Michigan
I grew up in a house on Saginaw bay
My dad was a poor, hard working Saginaw fisherman
Too many times he came home with too little pay
I loved a girl (I loved a girl) in Saginaw, Michigan (Saginaw, Michigan)
The daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
But he called me "That son of a Saginaw fisherman"
And not good enough to claim his daughter's hand
Now I'm up here in Alaska, looking around for gold
Like a crazy fool, I'm digging in this frozen ground so cold
But with each new day, I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I wrote my love (I wrote my love) in Saginaw, Michigan  (Saginaw, Michigan)
I said, "Honey, I'm coming home, please wait for me
And you can tell your dad, I'm coming back a richer man
I hit the biggest strike in Klondike history"
Her dad met me (Her dad met me) in Saginaw, Michigan  (Saginaw, Michigan)
He gave me a great big party with champagne
Then he said, "Son, you're a wise young ambitious man
Will you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim?"
Now he's up there in Alaska, diggin' in the cold, cold ground
The greedy fool is looking for the gold I never found
It serves him right, and no one here is missing him
Least of all the newlyweds of Saginaw, Michigan
We're the happiest man and wife in Saginaw, Michigan
He's ashamed to show his face in Saginaw, Michigan

===== Lefty Frizzell - She's Gone, Gone, Gone =====
She said if I ever deceived her
She'd be gone before I could count ten
I guess that I didn't believe her
'Cause look at the trouble I'm in
She's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Crying won't bring her back
The more that I cry, the faster that train
Flies farther on down the track
I've lost every right to be happy
When I lost the heaven I found
She warned me she'd leave and she left me
Before my first tear hit the ground
If I only knew where to find her
I'd crawl there on my hands and knees
Each tick of the clock's a reminder
She's one second farther from me

===== Lefty Frizzell - I'm Not The Man I'm Supposed To Be =====
I'm supposed to shake his hand and walk all smiling
Make believe that you don't mean a thing to me
I'm supposed to offer my congratulations
But I'm not the man that I supposed to be
I'm supposed to make believe I won't miss you
And forget the times you held me tenderly
I'm supposed to tell the world it never happened
I'd rather stand up and fight for what's mine
And to give you up it's just too much for me
So if I don't shake his hand and come out fighting
That I'm not the man that I supposed to be
So if I don't shake his hand

===== Lefty Frizzell - How Far Down Can I Go =====
I've hurt one who loved me
They don't understand that my love is out of control
All that really matters is this bottle in my hand
How far down can I go?
Tonight it's the bottom, tomorrow what then
Anything that brings the happy glow
Once I loved someone, I wish I could again
I'd steal and use those dimes for a small glass of wine
My hands get too trembling so
I brought many a tear to my mama's eyes

===== Lefty Frizzell - I Never Go Around Mirrors =====
I can't stand to see a good man go to waste
One who never combs his hair or shaves his face
A man who leans on wine over love that's told a lie
It tears me up to see a grown man cry
I never go around mirrors
I can't stand to see me without you by my side
'Cause I've got a heartache to hide
And it tears me up to see a grown man cry

===== Lefty Frizzell - That's The Way Love Goes =====
I've been throwin' horseshoes
Over my left shoulder
I've spent most all of my life
Searchin' for that four-leaf clover
Yet, you run with me
Chasin' my rainbows
I love you too
That's the way love goes
That's the way love goes, babe
That's the music God made
For all the world to sing
It's never old, it grows
Losing makes me sorry
You say, "Honey, now don't you worry
I love you too"

===== Lefty Frizzell - Give Me More, More, More (Of Your Kisses) =====
When my gal and I go on a date
We always come in kinda late
When I say goodnight at her front door
I always beg for one kiss more
Give me more, more, more of your kisses
I want more, more, more tender kisses
And when I finally go
You can hear the rooster crow
Oh please give me one more tender kiss
Now I'll admit I lose some sleep
By staying out so late
But when I kiss my gal goodnight
The sleep will have to wait
The neighbors all raise Cain
And I know that it's a shame
But I've got to have another tender kiss
Now all the neighbors in her block
Have offered things, you see
They'll even pay the wedding bills
To just get rid of me
Yelling more, more, more of your kisses
I cry for more, more, more tender kisses
And when I leave her door
You can hear me beg for more
Oh, please give me one more tender kiss

===== Lefty Frizzell - How Long Will It Take to Stop Loving You =====
How long would it take to count all the stars
How long would it take to climb up to Mars
How long has this old world stood so true
Well, that's how long it'd take me to stop loving you
How long has the sea had water so deep
How long has the mountain stood so steep
How long has it been since this world was new
Well, that's how long it'll take me to stop loving you
How long is forever and a day
How old is time dear, can you say
How long has God's love been so true
Well, that's how long it would take me to stop loving you

===== Lefty Frizzell - Shine, Shave, Shower (It's Saturday) =====
Oh it's Saturday yes it's Saturday
Gonna shine, shave, shower and brush my teeth
Go out a dancing and forget my grief
Make all the nightclubs in this town
'Cause my sweet baby's gonna show me around
Well we'll go here and there and everywhere
Where we go I just don't care
We'll do the town up and we'll do it right
Because tonight is Saturday night
Who cares if talk gets around?
Just cause I'm sly and not so mean
Saturday don't come but once a week
Go out a dance and forget my grief
We'll do the town up and do it right
Daylight will catch me going strong
One only lives once in a life
And I don't have a nagging wife
Gonna shine, shave, shower and shampoo
Go out a dance the whole night through
I'll swing it left and I'll swing it right

===== Lefty Frizzell - Brakeman's Blues =====
Portland Maine is just the same as sunny Tennessee
Any old place I hang my hat is home sweet home to me
I went to the depot and looked up on the board
It said it's good times here but better on down the road
I'll eat my breakfast here get my dinner in New Orleans
I'm going to get me a momma Lord I ain't never seen
Well where was your momma when the train left the shed
Where was your momma when the train left the shed
Standin' in my front door wishin' to God I was dead

===== Ernest Tubb - Walking The Floor Over You =====
You left me, and you went away
You said that you'd be back in just a day
You've broken your promise, and you've left me here alone
I don't know why you did, dear,  but I do know that you're gone
I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink, that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Aw, pick it out, Smitty!
Now darling, you know I love you well
Love you more than I can ever tell
I thought that you wanted me and always would be mine
But you went and left me here with troubles on my mind
Aw, do it pretty, son!
Now someday you may be lonesome too
Walking the floor is good for you
Just keep right on walking, and it won't hurt you to cry
Remember that I love you and I will the day I die

===== Ernest Tubb - Mean Mama Blues =====
There's lots of mean women on almost any street
Lord There's lots of mean women on almost any street
But I've got the meanest Mama that ever walked on two feet
That gal is so low down I often wonder why
Lord she's so low down I often wonder why
That she keeps on livin' I guess she's to mean to die
Now you triflin' women always say you love your man
Lord you triflin' women always say you love your man
And when he goes out the front door the back door lets a new man in
(Ah maybe two of them)
Now there's two things in this world I don't understand
Lord there's two things in this world that I don't understand
One of thems a woman the other ones a man
I'm gonna buy me a pistol I'll think I'll get a 44
Gonna buy me a pistol I'll think I'll get a 44
And when I get through shootin' that girl won't step no more

===== Ernest Tubb - Our Baby's Book =====
There's a new star in heaven tonight
The brightest of them all up there
As we gaze at the sky
We wonder why
That the Lord took our baby so fair
For he was as sweet as the rose
His eyes was so big bright and blue
And it made me so glad they said he favors his dad
And my wife said: "He's the image of you"
Now you should see our baby's book
It's pink and bordered with gold
Though it's not complete
But on the first sheet
Our darling's life story is told
It tells of the days that he came
To add more joy to our home
After seven short weeks
Our Master did speak
And now Rodger Dale has gone
But I know that he's happy up there
I can vision each action and look
Friends, as you travel on
Please remember this song
For it's written in our baby's book

===== Ernest Tubb - You Nearly Lose Your Mind =====
Well if you love your mama and you treat her right
But she keeps on fussin' at you every day and night
And she's triflin' on ye they'll do it every time
And when your baby starts to steppin' Lord you nearly lose your mind
Now if your mama's mean take a tip from me
Lock her up at home Lord and hang on to the key
Cause she won't triflin' on ye they'll do it every time
But if your mama's good I'll tell you what to do
Give her lots of lovin' and what she wants to do
She'll trifle on ye they'll do it every time
Now you come home to your mama find your clothes ain't clean
You can bet you're slippin' if you know just what I mean
Cause she's been triflin' on ye they'll do it every time
Now you may have a mama who says that she is true
But wait till you get down and out and really leave her too
Now I've been lotta places not much I ain't done
But when it comes to women I just don't trust a one
Because they'll trifle on ye they'll do it every time
(Really drive you crazy)

===== Ernest Tubb - Soldier's Last Letter =====
When the postman delivered the letter
Well, it filled her old heart full of joy
But she didn't know 'til she read the inside
It was the last one from her darling boy
"Dear Mom," was the way that it started
"I miss you so much," it went on
"And, Mom, I didn't know that I loved you so
But I'll prove it when this war is won"
"I'm writing this down in a trench, Mom
So don't scold if it isn't so neat
For you know as you did, when I was a kid
And would come home with mud on my feet"
"Well, the captain just gave us our orders
And mom we will carry them through
I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
But for now I'll just say I love you"
Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
As she fought against tears in her eyes
For they came unashamed, there was no name
And she knew that her darlin' had died
That night as she knelt by her bedside
She prayed, "Lord above, hear my plea
Protect all the sons that are fighting tonight
And dear God keep America free"...

===== Ernest Tubb - Tomorrow Never Comes =====
Oh you tell me that you love me yes you tell me that you care
That tomorrow we'll be married but tomorrow's never there
No tomorrow never comes no tomorrow never comes
Now you tell me that you love me but tomorrow never comes
Many weeks now have I waited many long nights have I cried
Just to see that happy morning when I'd have you by my side
(No tomorrow never comes no tomorrow never comes
Now you tell me that you love me but tomorrow never comes)
So tomorrow I'll be leaving yes tomorrow I'll be gone
And tomorrow you'll be weeping but tomorrow never comes
No tomorrow never comes...

===== Ernest Tubb - It's Been So Long Darling =====
It's been so long, darlin'
Since I had to go away
And I'll never forget that day
Although you never mentioned it
You cried that whole daylong
But now I'm comin' home
(Chorus)
Since I gazed into your eyes
Do you really realize
That the thought of seein' you
It scares me through and through
Since I had a kiss from you
But it won't be long now
But I've kept every vow
I pray that you'll be waiting
As you did in days gone by
Please don't blame me if I cry
(Repeat chorus)

===== Ernest Tubb - Rainbow At Midnight =====
After the war was over
I was coming home to you
I saw a rainbow at midnight
Out on the ocean blue
The stars in heaven were shining
The moon gave its light from above
I saw your face in this rainbow
And it made me think of our love
We'll build our home in the country
And make all our dreams come true
There we will make a heaven
Sweetheart just for we two
Here we will live so happy
And have a baby or two
We'll name them after the rainbow
Because it reminds me of you
After this life is over
And our journey here is through
We'll move to the land of the rainbow
And live in the starry blue

===== Ernest Tubb - Filipino Baby =====
When the warship's left Manila sailing proudly o'er the sea
All the sailors hearts were filled with fond regret
Looking backward to this Island where they spent such happy hours
Making love to every pretty girl they've met
(Well up stopped a little sailor with his pride eyes all aglow
Saying take a look at my girl's photograph)
Then the sailors gathered round him just to look upon her face
And he said I love my Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby she's my trasure and my pet
Her teeth are bright and pearly and her hair is black as jet
Oh her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know
She's my darling my little Filipino baby
In a little rustic cottage in the port of Philippines dwells a lonely little maiden all alone
(She is thinking of her true love though he's far across the sea
And her heart beats true for him and him alone)
Then one day he whispered darling I've come back from Caroline
I've come back to claim the only girl I love
And that night there was a wedding while the ships crew gathered round
And he wed his little Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby she's my treasure and my pet

===== Ernest Tubb - Drivin' Nails In My Coffin =====
My sweetheart has gone and I'm so lonely she said that she and I were through
So I started out drinking for past time drivin' nails in my coffin over you
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin everytime I drink a bottle of booze
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin Lord I'm drivin' those nails over you
Now ever since the day that we've parted I've been so sad and so blue
I'm always thinking of you love and I just can't quit drinking that old booze
I'm just drivin' nails in my coffin...
Now you've turned me down you don't want me there's nothing now I can lose
I'm just drivin' those nails in my coffin and worryin' my darlin' over you

===== Ernest Tubb - Have You Ever Been Lonely (Have You Ever Been Blue)? =====
Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?
Have you ever loved someone
Just as I love you?
Can't you see that I'm sorry
For each mistake I've made
Can't you see I've changed, dear
Can't you see I've paid
Be a little forgiving
And take me back in your heart
How can I go on living
Now that we're apart
If you knew what I've been through
Then you'd know why I ask you

===== Ernest Tubb - Let's Say Goodbye Like We Said Hello =====
Let's say goodbye like we said hello in a friendly kind of way
There's something wrong your love is gone I've no reason now to stay
We live and love we meet and part and broken hearts must pay
Your love sweetheart I won't forget you're always on my mind
You're all the happiness I knew so thoughtful sweet and kind
For old time sake I'm asking you to think of me some day
(I wish you happiness sweetheart in everything you do
May good luck always come your way and every dream come true)
I remember you and the love we knew the love of yesterday
If I should meet some other dear and learn to love them too
I hope and pray somehow sweetheart they'll make me think of you
A tender smile an old love song a heart so light and gay

===== Ernest Tubb - Slipping Around =====
Seems I always had to slip around to be with you my dear
Slippin' around afraid we'd might be found
I know I can't forget you and I've got to have you near
But we'll just have to slip around and live in constant fear
Though you're tied up with someone else and I'm all tied up too
I know I've made mistakes dear but I'm so in love with you
I hope someday I'll find a way to bring you back with me
Then I won't have to slip around to have our company
Though you're tied up...

===== Ernest Tubb - Blue Christmas =====
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
(Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree)
(Won't mean a thing, dear, if you're not here with me)
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
I'll have a blue Christmas, I know, dear
(I hope your white Christmas brings you cheer)
And when you say your prayers on this Christmas Eve
Will you feel the same dear as when you prayed with me
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
(That's when those blue memories start callin')

===== Ernest Tubb - Letters Have No Arms =====
I just got your letter dearest sweetheart and darling I miss you oh so much
Your letter has cheered me but I'm lonesome lonesome just to feel your loving touch
Letters have no arms dear to hold me kisses on paper are so cold
These sweet things you write in your letter I wanna be with you dear when told
Letters never bring me the touch of your hand or none of your sweet loving charms
I get so lonesome for you darling and you know that letters have no arms
Letters never bring me...

===== Ernest Tubb - I Love You Because =====
I love you because you understand dear
Every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand dear
But most of all I love you cause you're you
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
I love you because my heart is lighter
Every time you're walking by my side
I love you because the future's brighter
The door to happiness you've opened wide
No matter what may be the style or seasons
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons

===== Ernest Tubb - Goodnight, Irene =====
Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams
Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now me and my wife are parted
Gonna take another stroll down town
I’ll see you in my dreams
Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in the town
Sometimes I take a fool notion
To jump in the river and drown
Stop rambling, stop your gambling
Stop staying out late at night
Go home to your wife and family
And stay by the fire side bright

===== Ernest Tubb - You Don't Have To Be A Baby To Cry =====
You don't have to be a baby to cry
All you need is for love to go wrong
Or to lie awake the whole night long
When you leave me my golden rainbow disappears
And you leave me a broken heart that's full of tears
These ain't raindrops in my eyes why should I lie
You don't have to be a baby.....

===== Ernest Tubb - Two Glasses Joe =====
Set up two glasses Joe and turn the jukebox low and let me sit and reminisce
While I pretend that she is sittin' here with me the way she did not long ago
We used to paint the town red and dance until two
Well I don't paint it red no more but I'm paintin' it blue
He's stole her love I know but he can't stop me Joe from having just a dream or two
Set up two glasses Joe maybe you didn't know but there's a mem'ry in the room
A memory that walks a memory that talks and haunts me everywhere I go
I'm just a fool who loves her and will till I die
From the very first hello until the last goodbye
And this is that you know so fill two glasses Joe and leave me here alone to cry

===== Ernest Tubb - The Yellow Rose Of Texas =====
There's a yellow rose in Texas that I'm gonna see
Nobody else could miss her not half as much as me
She cried so when I left her it'd like to broke my heart
And if I'd ever find her we never more will part
She's the sweetest little resebud that Texas ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds they sparkle like the dew
Gimme talk about you Clementine and sing of Resalee
But the Yellow Rose of Texas is the only girl for me
Where the Rio Grande is flowing and the skies are bright
She walks along the river in the quiet summer night
I know that she remembers when we parted long ago
I promised that I'll return and not to leave her so
She's the sweetest little resebud...
Now I'm going back to find her for my heart is full of vow
We'll do the things together we did so long ago
We'll play the banjo gaily she'll love me like before
And the Yellow Rose of Texas shall be mine for ever more

===== Shania Twain - Man! I Feel Like A Woman! =====
Let's go, girls
Come on
I'm goin' out tonight
I'm feelin' alright
Gonna let it all hang out
Wanna make some noise
Really raise my voice
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout
Ah, no inhibitions
Make no conditions
Get a little outta line
I ain't gonna act
Politically correct
I only wanna have a good time
The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and
Oh-oh-oh, go totally crazy
Forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh-oh-oh, really go wild, yeah
Doin' it in style
Oh-oh-oh, get in the action
Feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh-oh-oh, I wanna be free, yeah
To feel the way I feel
Man, I feel like a woman
Hoo
The girls need a break
Tonight, we're gonna take
The chance to get out on the town
We don't need romance
We only wanna dance
We're gonna let our hair hang down
The best thing about bein' a woman
Oh, oh, uh-huh
Oh yeah
Is the prerogative to have a little fun (Fun, fun)
To feel the way I feel (To feel the way I feel)
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
I get totally crazy
Can you feel it?
Come, come, come on, baby
Hoo, hoo, hoo
I feel like a woman

===== Shania Twain - You're Still The One =====
When I first saw you, I saw love
And the first time you touched me, I felt love
And after all this time
You're still the one I love
Mmm, yeah
Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come, my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday
They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holdin' on
We're still together, still goin' strong
(You're still the one) You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one) You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
You're still the one
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah
You're still the one I want for life, oh, yeah
I'm so glad we made it

===== Shania Twain - Any Man Of Mine =====
This is what a woman wants
Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when I'm ugly, he still better love me
And I can be late for a date—that's fine
But he'd better be on time
Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day
And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!"
Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine
Well, any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's looking better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He'd better say, "Mmm, I like it like that, yeah"
Let me hear you say
(Any man, any man, any man)
You gotta shimmy shake
Make the earth quake
Kick, turn, stomp, stomp, then you jump
Heel to toe, do-si-do
'Til your boots wanna break
'Til your feet and your back ache
Keep it movin' 'til you just can't take anymore
Come on everybody on the floor
A-one two, a-three four
Hup two, hup
If you wanna be a man of mine, that's right

===== Shania Twain - That Don't Impress Me Much =====
Ow
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all
Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist
That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve—just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
’Cause heaven forbid it should fall outta place
Okay, so you're Brad Pitt
That don't impress me much (Oh, oh, ooh)
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch?
Yeah
You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
Now, come on, baby, tell me, you must be joking, right?
Oh-oh, you think you're something special
Okay, so you've got a car
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch?
That don't impress me much (That don't impress me)
Oh, oh no, you think you're cool, but have you got the touch?
Now, now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night
Okay, so what do you think, you're Elvis or something?
Whatever
That don't impress me

===== Shania Twain - From This Moment On =====
I do swear that I'll always be there
I'd give anything and everything and I will always care
Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow
For better for worse, I will love you
With every beat of my heart
From this moment, life has begun
From this moment, you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on
From this moment, I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love, I'd give my last breath
I give my hand to you with all my heart
I can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you
From this moment, as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
Ohh
You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
From this moment
I will love you (I will love you), as long as I live
From this moment on (On)
Mmm, mmm

===== Shania Twain - Honey, I'm Home =====
The car won't start, it's falling apart
I was late for work and the boss got smart
My pantyline shows, got a run in my hose
My hair went flat, man, I hate that (Hate that)
Oh, just when I thought things couldn't get worse
I realized I forgot my purse
With all this stress, I must confess
This could be worse than PMS
This job ain't worth the pay
Can't wait until the end of the day
Hey honey, I'm on my way
Hey (Hey)
Hey
Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
Rub my feet, give me something to eat
Fix me up my favorite treat
Honey, I'm back, my neck's killing me
I need to relax and watch TV
Get off the phone, give the dog a bone
Honey, I'm home
I broke a nail opening the mail
I cursed out loud 'cause it hurt like hell
This job's a pain; it's so mundane
It sure don't stimulate my brain
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, rub my neck, will you?
Yeah, woo
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Mmm, I'm home
Oh
Oh, that feels much better

===== Shania Twain - No One Needs To Know =====
Am I dreaming or stupid?
I think I've been hit by cupid
But no one needs to know right now
I met a tall, dark and handsome man
And I've been busy making big plans
I got my heart set, my feet wet
But he don't even know it yet
And no one needs to know right now
I'll tell him someday, some way, somehow
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now
I want bells to ring, a choir to sing
The white dress, the guests, the cake, the car, the whole darn thing
We'll have a little girl, a little boy
A little Benji we call Leroy
And I'm not lonely anymore at night
And he don't know only, only he can make it right
I'm not dreaming or stupid
But boy, have I been hit by cupid
No one needs to know right now
There's your record Hoggs
Yup, there you go dudes

===== Shania Twain - You've Got A Way =====
You've got a way with me
Somehow you got me to believe
In everything that I could be
I've gotta say, you really got a way
You've got a way it seems
You gave me faith to find my dreams
You'll never know just what that means
Can't you see?
It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love
You've got a way with words
You get me smiling even when it hurts
There's no way to measure what your love is worth
I can't believe the way you get through to me
Oh, how I adore you
Like no one before you
I love you just the way you are
Oh, it's in the way you hold me
It's just the way you are

===== Shania Twain - Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You) =====
Cool
Yeah
Uh-uh, yeah
You're so complicated
You hang over my shoulder when I read my mail
I don't appreciate it
When I talk to other guys, you think they're on my tail
I get so aggravated
When I get off the phone and get the third degree
I'm really feelin' frustrated
Why don't you take a pill and put a little trust in me?
And you'll see
Don't freak out until you know the facts
Relax
Don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be ridiculous, you know I need you
Don't be absurd, you know I want you
Don't be impossible
I'm mad about you (I'm mad about you)
I can't live without you (Can't live without you)
I'm crazy about you (I'm crazy about you)
Stop overreacting
You even get suspicious when I paint my nails
It's definitely distracting
The way you dramatize every little small detail
Relax, Max
No, no, no
So don't be stupid, you know I love you
Don't be stupid
My baby
Don't be impossible, impossible
Oh, no, no, no
Don't be, don't be, don't be, baby
Don't be ridiculous
No, no
Oh, don't be stupid

===== Shania Twain - Giddy Up! =====
I left my heart at a waterin' hole
Somewhere in small-town Ohio
Headed out west to Arizona
'Cause the east coast weather's too cold, cold, cold
Easy come, easy go
I got a fast car with the '90s on
Not a soul on the road, but the road is home
Smiles for miles
All up on my face (My face)
Wear it, share it
'Cause we ain't got time to waste (Get to it)
Up in your giddy up, giddy, giddy up
Up in your giddy up
Drunk in the city, got litty in the cup
When it gets tough, gotta get a little love
Put some up in your giddy, giddy up
Time to make it happеn 'cause it feels so good
Singin' in the mirror like it's Hollywood
Lifе is gettin' shorter, gotta drink it up
Time to shine like I know you should
Slide to the left, then slide to the right
Jump in the air 'til you're ten feet high, yeah
Come on, come on and make it your night
La-la, la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-la
Giddy up
La, la-la-la-la (Woah)
La, la-la-la-la (Hey)

===== Shania Twain - Forever And For Always =====
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, in your arms
Ohh
I can hear your heartbeat now
I can hear it beating loud
In your arms
I can still feel the way you want me when you hold me
I can still hear the words you whispered when you told me
I can stay right here forever in your arms
And there ain't no way
I'm letting you go now
And there ain't no how
I'll never see that day
'Cause I'm keeping you forever and for always
We will be together all of our days
Wanna wake up every morning to your sweet face
Always
Mmm, baby
In your heart
I can still hear a beat for every time you kiss me
And when we're apart, I know how much you miss me
I can feel your love for me in your heart
And there ain't no way (And there ain't no way)
Oh, yeah
Wanna wake up every morning, yeah
Oh
In your eyes (I can still see the look of the one)
I can still see the look of the one who really loves me
(I can still feel the way that you want)
The one who wouldn't put anything else in the world above me
(I can still see love for me) I can still see love for me in your eyes
(I still see the love)
I'm keeping you forever and for always
I'm keeping you forever
Got to keep you, baby
Oh, forever

===== Shania Twain - You Win My Love =====
Come on
I'm lookin' for a lover who can rev his little engine up
He can have a '55 Chevy or a fancy little pick-up truck
If he's got a cool Cadillac with a jacuzzi in the back, I'm in, oh yeah
'Cause I'm a classy little chassis who's a-huntin' for a heart to win
Oh, but if you wanna win it
There's no speed limit
Just go faster, faster, don't be slow
Rev it up, rev it up 'til your engine blows
You win my love
You win my soul
You win my heart
Yeah, you get it all
You make my motor run
Yeah, you're number one
Oh, I'm a crazy little chassis
Yeah, the kind you just can't slow down
Oh no
I need a '65 cylinder, racy, little run around town
Babe, there's no speed limit
Oh, uh-oh, yeah
I want a heartbreak Harley
A full of steam dream machine
Or just a little late night sexy long stretch limousine
Oh, you win my love
I said you win my love
Babe, you win my love
Yeah, you win my love

===== Shania Twain - Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under? =====
Whose bed have your boots been under?
And whose heart did you steal, I wonder?
This time, did it feel like thunder, baby?
But whose bed have your boots been under?
Don't look so lonely
Don't act so blue
I know I'm not the only
Girl you run to
I know about Lolita
Your little Spanish flame
I've seen you around with Rita
The redhead down the lane
And who did you run to?
And whose lips have you been kissing?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missing, baby?
Well, whose bed have your boots been under?
I heard you've been sneaking
Around with Jill
And what about that weekend
With Beverly Hill
And I've seen you walking
With long-legs Louise
And you weren't just talking
Last night with Denise
Come on, boots
Oh yeah (Come on)
So next time you're lonely
Don't call on me
Try the operator
Maybe she'll be free
This time, did it feel like thunder?
I wanna know whose bed, baby
Whoa baby
Tell me
Whose bed
Yes, I wanna know
You better start talking
Or you better start walking

===== Shania Twain - Come On Over =====
Get a life, get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break, take control
Take advice from someone you know, oh
Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
You can unwind, take a load off your mind
Make a wish, make a move
Make up your mind, you can choose
When you're up, when you're down
When you need a laugh, come around
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Be a winner, be a star
Yeah, be happy to be who you are
Got to be yourself, gotta make a plan
Got to go for it while you can
Oh-oh, yeah
Uh-huh
Come on in
You can unwind, take a load off your mind, yeah
(Come on over, come on in) Come on over, come on in
Come on, come on in (Oh, oh, oh)
And I say yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
No, no, no (Oh, oh, oh)

===== Shania Twain - Love Gets Me Every Time =====
Hm
Oww!
Life was goin' great
Love was gonna have to wait
Was in no hurry
Had no worries
Staying single was the plan
Didn't need a steady man
I had it covered
'Til I discovered
That love gets me every time
My heart changed my mind
And I gol' darn gone and done it
Gone and done it (Gone and done it)
Guess I fell in love (Gone and done it)
Must've been the way he walked (Gone and done it)
Or the sweet, sweet talk (Gone and done it)
I guess I, gol' darn gone (Gone) and done it
I was quite content
Just a-paying my own rent
It was my place
I needed my space
I was free to shop around
In no rush to settle down
I gol' darn gone and done it
Ah, ow
Ooh!
Hmmm, mmmm
Well, love gets me every time
Ooh, oooh, or his sweet, sweet talk (Gone and done it)
It's in the way he calls my name (Gone and done it)
And I know I'll never be the same (Gone and done it)
Don't cha know that...
Love gets me every time
I gol' darn gone (Gone) and done it
Woo
Thought I had it covered, uh-huh
Life was going great
Well, I gol' darn gone and done it

===== Shania Twain - Up! =====
I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
I'm goin' up
I'm goin' up, up, up, up
It's 'bout as bad as it could be
Seems everybody's buggin' me
Like nothing wants to go my way
Yeah, it just ain't been my day
Nothing's coming easily
Even my skin is acting weird
I wish that I could grow a beard
Then I could cover up my spots
Not play connect the dots
I just wanna disappear
Up, up, up
Can only go up from here
Where the clouds gonna clear
There's no way but up from here
Even something as simple as
Forgetting to fill up on gas
There ain't no explanation why
Things like that can make you cry
Just gotta learn to have a laugh
Oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When everything is goin' wrong
Don't worry, it won't last for long
Yeah, it's all gonna come around
Don't go let it get you down
You gotta keep on holding on
It's about as bad as it could be (Bad as it could be)
Seems everybody's bugging me (Everybody's bugging me)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And up, up, up
Up, up, up, ooh
Up, up, up, up, I'm goin' up (I'm goin' up)
Ohh

===== Shania Twain - Life's About To Get Good =====
I wasn't just broken, I was shattered
I trusted you so much, you're all that mattered
You no longer love me, and I sang like a sad bird
I couldn't move on, and I think you were flattered
Oh, life's about joy (Joy)
Life's about pain (Pain)
It's all about forgiving and the will to walk away
I'm ready to be loved (Loved)
And love the way I should (Should)
Life's about, life's about to get good
Oh, life's about to get good
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
The longer my tears fell, the wider the river (Good to love you, baby)
It killed me that you'd give your life to be with her (Good to love you, baby)
I had to believe that things would get better (Better, better)
It was time to forget you, forever
It took me so long to be strong
But I'm alive, and I hold on
To what I can feel, it hurts to heal
Oh, when love lies
(About to get good)
(About to get... ah)
Life's about joy (So much joy right now)
Life's about pain
(Oh, the will to walk away)
I'm ready to be loved, and love the way I should
(I wanna be loved the way I should)
Oh, life's about to get good (Life's about to get good)

===== Shania Twain - Whatever You Do! Don't! =====
Here we go
Yeah!
Deep in Denialville
Tryin' a' fight the way I feel
I go jello when you smile
I start blushin', my head rushin'
If you stand too close to me
I might melt down from the heat
If you look my way one more time
I'm gonna go out of my mind
Whatever you do
Don't even think about it
Don't go and get me started
Don't you dare drive me crazy
Don't do that to me, baby
Oh yeah
You stop me in my tracks
My heart pumping to the max
I'm such a sucker for your eyes
They permanently paralyze
(Whatever you do, don't do that to me) Oh
You got my heart under attack
You give me shivers down my back
Do you have to walk the way you do?
I get weak just watching you
Don't do that, don't do that

===== George Jones - I Gotta Get Drunk (with Willie Nelson) =====  
Well I gotta get drunk and I sure do dread it
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do
Gonna spend my money callin' everybody honey
And wind up singin' the blues
I'll spend my whole paycheck on some old wreck
And brother I can name you a few
Well, I gotta get drunk and I sure do dread it
Well, I gotta get drunk, Lord, I can't stay sober
There's a lot of good people in town
They love to hear me holler, see me spend my dollar
I wouldn't dream of lettin 'em down
Well, there's a lot of good doctors keep a-tellin' me, George
You'd better start slowin' it down
But there's more old drunks than there are old doctors
So I guess we'd better have another round
I'll start to spend my money callin' everybody honey
And baby, I can name you a few
'Cause I know just what I'm gonna do...

===== Bob Wills - New Texas Playboy Rag =====  
Oh, Mister fiddling man, please strike up the band
And play that Texas playboy rag
There ain't no rhythm aroun' that rides right on down
Like that Texas Playboy Rag
So carry me back to Texas
Where waves the Lone Star flag
Carry me back to Texas
With that Texas playboy rag
I see that old Alamo and blue bonnets grow
When I hear that tune you see?
And memories start to roam of my Texas home
When I hear that melody
Where waves the Lone Star flag
Carry me back to Texas
With that Texas playboy rag
Oh, mister fiddling man, now you understand
Why I love this melody?
To me it's more than a song
It takes me along back to where I long to be

===== Bob Wills - Smoke On The Water =====  
There will be a sad day comin′ for the souls of all mankind
They must answer to the people, and it's troublin′ their minds
Everybody who must fear them will rejoice on that great day
When the powers of dictators shall be taken all away
There'll be smoke on the water, on the land and the sea
When our army and navy overtakes the enemy
There'll be smoke on the mountains where the heathen gods stay
And the sun that is shinin′ will go down on that day
Hirohito, ′long with Hitler, will be ridin' on a rail
Mussolini′ll beg for mercy, as a leader he has failed
But there'll be no time for pity when the screamin′ eagle fly
That will be the end of Axis, they must answer with their lives
There′ll be smoke on the mountains where the heathen gods stay
And the sun that is shinin' will go down on that day

===== Bob Wills - Miss Molly =====  
Oh, have you seen Miss Molly
Her cheeks are rosy red
Her lips are soft as satin
And they taste like ginger bread
Oh, Oh, Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly I'm in love with you
Oh, me, oh, my Miss Molly won't you say you love me too
Now when Miss Molly's smilin'
The sun is dim a spell
And when she laughs
Her voice is like a little silver bell
I'll trade my horse and saddle
Cow drivin' I'll re-sign
If only Miss Molly
Will say that she'll be mine
Now listen dear Miss Molly
I've told you this before
And even though' I told you so
I'll tell you just once more

===== Bob Wills - Corrine, Corrina =====  
Corrine Corrina, where you been so long?
Help me Corrina, where you been so long?
Ain′t had no lovin' since you been gone
Come on home Corrina, yeah tell some
I love Corrina, tell the world I do
I love Corrina, you know darn well I do
Just a little more loving
Let your heart be true, yes hell now
Corrine, Corrina be a pal of mine
′Cause you got me walking
Yell and rolling and grimes, yes
Corrine, Corrina is it true what they say?
Tell me Corrina is it true what they say?
That you are growing colder
More an' more every day
Corrine, Corrina where did you stay last night?
Tell me Corrina where were you last night?
Come home this morning
Sun was shining bright, dont let it happen again Corrine
Goodbye Corrina, this is fare you well
So long Corrina, this is fare you well
When I get back babe
You never can tell, yeah

===== Bob Wills - That’s What I Like About The South =====  
Won't you come with me to Alabamy?
Let's go see my dear old Mammy
She's fryin' eggs and boiling hammy
That's what I like about the South
Now there you can make no mistakey
Where those nerves are never shaky
Ought to taste her layer cakey
She's got baked ribs and candied yams
Those sugar-cured Virginia hams
Basement full of those berry jams
An' that's what I like about the South
Hot corn bread, black eyed peas
You can eat as much as you please
'Cause it's never out of season
Ah, don't take one, have two
There's dark brown and chocolate too
Suits me, they must suit you
'Cause that's what I like about the South
Well it's way, way down where the cane grows tall
Down where they say, "Y'all"
Walk on in with that Southern drawl
Down where they have those pretty queens
Keep a-dreamin' those dreamy dreams
Well let's sip that absinthe in New Orleans
Here comes that man with all the news
Box back coat with button shoes
All paid up with his union dues
And that's what I like about the South
Now there's a place down south called Dowadiddy
It ain't no jive and it ain't no city
It's awful small, but it sure is pretty
That's Dowadiddy
Here come old Roy down the street
Ho, can't you hear those tappin' feet
He would rather sleep than eat
Now every time I pass your door
You act like you don't want me no more
Why don't you shake that head and sigh
And I'll go truckin' right on by
Well, I didn't come here to criticize
I'm not here to sympathize
But don't tell me those no-good lies
That a lyin' gal like you can devise
If you love me like I love you
Send me fifty P-D-Q
Roses are red and violets are pink
If I don't get all fifty, I don't show
She's got backbones and turnip greens
Ham hocks and butter beans
You, me and New Orleans

===== Bob Wills - Red Hot Gal Of Mine =====  
Look north or south east or west I pretend I have the best
Telling you about that red hot gal of mine
She’s got rhythm in her walk when she struts the whole town talks             
I’m telling you about that red hot gal of mine
Lovely here charming there thinks she’s got the beauty to bare                           
Rosie cheeks eyes of brown the hottest little baby in this town                                              
She’s got these she’s got those she dresses up from head to toe                                   

===== Bob Wills - Whoa Babe =====  
Whoa babe, oh yeah
Whoa babe, what can the matter be?
Whoa babe, something still bother me
How come I can′t come knocking around your door? (Yeah)
Whoa babe, how come you let me down?
Whoa babe, why can't I hang around?
Since when ain′t I your badass boy no more?
Everynight, I take you out
You are the one to frown and I
Some day you make me shout
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa"
Whoa babe, how do you get that way
Whoa babe, some day you gonna pay
But I leave you, I'll knock on your door no more
(Yes, brother L. Sam)
(All kinda grooving around on that old semi-guitar)
How come I can't come knocking around your door? (Well)
Whoa babe, why can′t I hang around?
(Since you don't come knocking around my door)
Every night, I take you out
"Whoa, dibidibi babap whoa"
Whoa babe, how do you get that way?
But I leave you, I knock on your door no more

===== Bob Wills - Across The Alley From The Alamo =====  
Across the alley from the Alamo
Lived a pinto pony and a Navajo
Who sang a sort of Indian Hideho
To the people passing by
The pinto spent his time a swichin' flies
And the Navajo watched the lazy skies
And very rarely did they ever rest their eyes
On the people passing by
One day they went a walkin'
Along the railroad track
They were swishin' not lookin'
Toot toot
They never came back
When the summer sun decides to settle low
A fly sings an Indian Hideho
Who used to bake frijoles in cornmeal dough

===== Ray Price - Jealous Lies =====  
Jealous lies are what you're telling
You're afraid that I'll find someone new
Jealous tears are what you're wasting
You are trying to make me jealous too
I don't care if you find a million others
And you're wasting your time teasing me
Jealous lies have made me doubt you
You are building a world of misery
Jealous lies will live to haunt you
When you're traveling down life's road alone
Jealous tears will dim your eyes dear
When the past memories tell you who was wrong
You're the kind to get careless when you're losing
There's no chance now for us to start anew
Jealous lies have made me hate you
Now you can't make me jealous over you

===== Ray Price - Weary Blues (From Waiting) =====  
Weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' too long
These blues have got me cryin'
Oh, sweet ma-a-ma, please come home.
The snow falls 'round my window
But it can't chill my heart
God knows it died the day you left
My dream world fell a part.
Through tears I watch young lovers
As they go strollin' by
Oh, all the things that might have been
God forgive me if I cry.
Oh, sweet ma-a-ma, please come home

===== Ray Price - The Same Old Me =====  
When i saw you with your new love today
It hurt me in an old familiar way
And i know there is nothin' i can do
But i'll always be here waiting just for you
With the same two arms still missin' you
And the same old heart still bein' true
And the same two lips they still belong to you
And the same old me keeps lovin' you
(fiddle solo, then steel solo)
I have tried everything to drive you from my heart
But the memory of you makes me feel so blue
And with every heartbeat i can feel the teardrops start
So you'll always find me waiting here for you

===== Ray Price - I Wish I Could Fall in Love Today =====  
I wished that I could fall in love today
But memories of you stand in the way
I just can't make my heart find someone new
It's always much too busy with the blues
I wish that I could fall in love today
But if I did I know I wouldn't stay
You'd come between us like you always do
Somehow they never measure up to you
Each night I pray I'll wake at dawn and find
Another in my heart and on my mind
Then I awake and hear my poor heart say

===== Eddy Arnold - I'll Hold You In My Heart ('Til I Can Hold You In My Arms) =====  
I'll hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
Like you'd never been held before
I'll think of you each day, and then I'll dream the night away
Till you are in my arms once more
The stars up in the sky know the reason why
I feel so blue when I'm away from you
So darlin', please wait for me

===== Eddy Arnold - In The Misty Moonlight =====  
In the misty moonlight
By the flickering firelight
Any place is all right
Long as I'm with you
In a faraway land
On the tropic sea sand
If your hand's in my hand
I won't be blue
Way up on the mountain
A way down in the valley
I know I'll be happy
Any place, anywhere, I don't care
Long as you are there

===== Eddy Arnold - Let It Be Me =====  
I bless the day I found you I want to stay around you
And so I beg you let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one if you must cling to someone
Now and forever let it be me
Each time we meet love I find complete love
Without your sweet sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me

===== Eddy Arnold - Happy Birthday To You =====  
I'm Eddy Arnold and I wanna tell you
About the most performed song of the past century
It was written by two school teachers
In Olive Hill Kentucky
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, happy birthday

===== Roger Miller - In The Summertime (You Don't Want My Love) =====  
In the summertime
When all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue
'Cause you don't want my love
Some other time
That's what you say when I want you
Then you laugh at me and make me cry
You don't seem to care a thing about me
You'd rather live without me
Than to have my arms around you
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone
Once upon a time
You used to smile and wave to me
And walk with me but now you don't
Some other guy
Is takin' up all your time
Now you don't have time for me

===== George Strait - I Cross My Heart =====  
Our love is unconditional, we knew it from the start
I see it in your eyes, you can feel it from my heart
From here on after let's stay the way we are right now
And share all the love and laughter that a lifetime will allow
I cross my heart and promise to
Give all I've got to give to make all your dreams come true
In all the world you'll never find
A love as true as mine
You will always be the miracle that makes my life complete
And as long as there's a breath in me, I'll make yours just as sweet
As we look into the future, it's as far as we can see
So let's make each tomorrow be the best that it can be
And if along the way we find a day it starts to storm
You've got the promise of my love to keep you warm

===== Conway Twitty - Two Timin’ Two Stepper =====  
He tells his wife he's going back to work
To finish something he's left undone
And like a fool she believes every word
The door slams and he's on the run
To that other side of town
Where the music's turned up
And the lights are turned down
He's a two timin' two stepper
Looking for a one-night stand
Sliding on the dance floor
Slippin' off his wedding band
He'll waltz into the heart
Of every pretty girl he can
Ooo, He's a two timin' two stepper
Everybody in town knows his name
They know his wife and they know his game
But he continues to play it just the same
'Cause he's a fool and he has no shame
But he always seems to find
Somebody new to believe his lines
He'll keep dancin' and foolin' around
Till the walls around him come a-tumblin' down
Sliding an the dance floor
Looking for a one-night stand...

===== Lefty Frizzell - My Baby's Just Like Money =====  
Well my baby's just like money
True while you hold her tight
But if you let her go she'll blow like dough
Honky-tonk day and night
For a friend of mine came and wised me up
And this is what he said
"Money goes from hand to hand and your baby goes from man to man"
Listen now, baby, and I don't mean maybe
I'm telling you you're making me blue
That's why I know it's true
For it goes to show you're just like dough
The root of all evil
For money goes from hand to hand
And my baby goes from man to man
Yeah my baby's just like money
She goes everywhere
And I'm a telling you her love's untrue
And I know that she don't care
Just as long as she's got a ticket to ride
That gal's satisfied
You've gotta change your way starting today
Or your daddy's not gonna stay
For I found out, honey, you're just like money
And you know you go from man to man

===== The Louvin Brothers - I’m Ready To Go Home =====  
Through the valleys of this life I have wandered
And I've worked for Jesus all along the way
But now I see the sun for me is setting
I have reached the ending of my way
Lord, I've been faithful in the service You have given
And the harvest of the fields, Lord, I have done
But now my steps are growing weary
Lord, I'm waiting, I'm ready to go home
Looking back upon the life I've lived for Jesus
I can see how He has helped me all the way
And the tears I've shed just helped to keep me humble
And each burden only taught me how to pray
Though I hate to leave so many friends behind me
And the parting of our ways will touch my heart
But I'll wait for them inside the gates of heaven
Where the children of God will never part

===== The Louvin Brothers - The Great Atomic Power =====  
Do you fear this man's invention that they call atomic power?
Are we all in great confusion, do we know the time or hour?
When a terrible explosion may rain down upon our land
Leaving horrible destruction, blotting out the works of man
Are you, are you ready for that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
Will you shout or will you cry when the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?
There is one way to escape it, be prepared to meet the lord
Give your heart and soul to Jesus, he will be your shielding sword
He will surely stay beside you and you'll never taste of death
For your soul will fly to safety and eternal peace and rest
There's an army who can conquer all the enemy's great band
It's the regiment of Christians guided by the savior's hand
When the mushroom of destruction falls in all it's fury great
God will surely save his children from that awful awful fate

===== The Louvin Brothers - I Don’t Believe You’ve Met My Baby =====  
Last night, my dear, the rain was falling
I went to bed so sad and blue
Then, I had a dream of you
I dreamed I was strolling in the evening
Underneath the harvest moon
I was thinking about you
And then we met me in the moonlight
The stars were shining in your eyes
But another was there too
"I don't believe you've met my baby"
You looked at him, you looked at me
I wondered who you were talking to
I shook the hand of your stranger
But I was shaking more inside
I was still wondering who
Your arm was resting on his shoulder
You smiled at him, he smiled at you
His eyes were filled with victory
He said, "My sister wants to marry"
Then my heart was filled with ease
I knew that you would marry me

===== The Louvin Brothers - In The Pines =====  
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Little girl, little girl, what have I done
Thats made you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia Line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab went by at nine
Was 19 coaches long
The only girl I ever loved
Is on that train and gone

===== The Louvin Brothers - Cash on the Barrel Head =====  
Got in a little trouble at the county seat
Lord, they put me in the jailhouse for loafing on the street
When the judge heard the verdict, I was a guilty man
He said, "Forty-five dollars or thirty days in the can"
"That'll be cash on the barrel head, son
You can make your choice, you're twenty one
No money down, no credit plan
No time to chase you 'cause I'm a busy man"
Found a telephone number on a laundry slip
I had a good-hearted jailer with a six-gun hip
He let me call long distance, she said, "Number, please"
And no sooner than I told her, she shouted out at me
Not part, not half, but the entire sum
'Cause a little bird tells me you're a traveling man"
Thirty days in the jailhouse, four days on the road
I was feeling mighty hungry, my feet a heavy load
Saw a greyhound coming, stuck up my thumb
Just as I was being seated, the driver caught my arm
Said, "That'll be cash on the barrel head, son
This old gray dog gets paid to run
When the engine stops, Lord, the wheels won't roll
Give me cash on the barrel head, I'll take you down the road"

===== The Louvin Brothers - Knoxville Girl =====  
I met a little girl in Knoxville, a town we all know well
And every Sunday evening, out in her home I'd dwell
We went to take an evening walk about a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground and knocked that fair girl down
She fell down on her bended knees for mercy she did cry
"Oh Willie dear, don't kill me here, I'm unprepared to die"
She never spoke another word, I only beat her more
Until the ground around me within her blood did flow
I took her by her golden curls and I drug her round and around
Throwing her into the river that flows through Knoxville town
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl with the dark and rolling eye
Go down, go down, you Knoxville girl, you can never be my bride
I started back to Knoxville, got there about midnight
My mother, she was worried and woke up in a fright
Saying, "Dear son, what have you done to bloody your clothes so?"
I told my anxious mother I was bleeding at my nose
I called for me a candle to light myself to bed
I called for me a handkerchief to bind my aching head
Rolled and tumbled the whole night through as troubles was for me
Like flames of hell around my bed and in my eyes could see
They carried me down to Knoxville and put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out, but none could go my bail
I'm here to waste my life away down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl, the girl I loved so well

===== The Louvin Brothers - Satan Is Real =====  
Satan is real, working in spirit
You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astray
I attended service at a little church
In the country not long ago
A prayer was led by an old country preacher
Who then raised his hands as everyone stood and sang
"My God is real"
A warm breeze through the open windows
Brought in the smell of new mown hay in a nearby field
And the singing of birds could be heard
In the moment of silence
As the preacher opened the bible to read
And then a little old man stood up, bent with age
His hair thin and white
And said, "Preacher, tell them that satan is real too"
You can hear him in songs that give praise to idols
And sinful things of this world
You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart
I know that satan is real
For once I had a happy home
I was loved and respected by my family
I was looked upon as a leader in my community
And then Satan came into my life
I grew selfish and un-neighborly
My friends turned against me
And finally, my home was broken apart
My children took their paths into a world of sin
Yes preacher, it's sweet to know that God is real
And know that in Him all things are possible
And we know that Heaven is a real place
Where joy shall never end
But sinner friend, if you're here today
Satan is real too
And hell is a real place
A place of everlasting punishment

===== The Louvin Brothers - Kneel At The Cross =====  
Kneel at the cross, Christ will meet you there
Come while He waits for you
Listen to His voice, leave with Him your cares
And begin life anew
Kneel at the cross, kneel at the cross
Leave every care, leave every care
Jesus will meet you there
Kneel at the cross, there is room for all
Who would His glory share
Bliss there awaits, harm can nary fall
Those who are anchored there
Kneel at the cross, give your idols up
Look unto realms above
Turn not away to life's sparkling cup
Trust only in His love

===== The Louvin Brothers - When I Stop Dreaming =====  
When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you
The worst that I've ever been hurt in my life
The first time I ever have wanted to die
Was the night when you told me you loved someone else
And asked me if I could forget
That's when I'll stop wanting you
I'd be like a flower unwanted in spring
Alone and neglected, transplanted in vain
To a garden of sadness where it's petals would fall
In the shadow of undying pain
That's when I'll stop thinking of you
You may teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble and teach it to grow
You may teach all the raindrops to return to the clouds
But you can't teach my heart to forget
That's when I'll stop crying for you

===== The Louvin Brothers - Katie Dear =====  
Oh Katie dear go ask your mother
If you can be a bride of mine
If she says yes come back and tell me
If she says no we'll run away
Oh Willie dear there's no use in asking
She's in her room a-takin’ rest
And by her side is a silver dagger
To slay the one that I love best
Oh Katie dear go ask your father
If he says yes, come back and tell me
If he says no, we'll run away
Oh Willie dear, there's no use in asking
He’s in his room a-takin’ rest
And by his side there's a golden dagger
Then he picked up this golden dagger
And stove it through his troubled heart
Saying "Goodbye, Katie goodbye darlin'
At last the time has come to part"
Then she picked up that bloody dagger
And stove it through her lily-white breast
Saying "Goodbye papa, goodbye mama
I'll die with the one that I love best"

===== The Louvin Brothers - The Angels Rejoiced Last Night =====  
A house not a home was the picture Satan painted
For sweet little sister and me
Our daddy would frown while mother was prayin'
His heart was so hardened that he would not believe
In anger he'd swear his voice low and loud
His Sundays were spent out with the gamblin' crowd
I've never seen my daddy inside the house of God
For Satan held his hand, down the path of sin he trod
Not long ago our circle was broken
When God called on Mother one night
In a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken
Asking our daddy to raise her children right
The angels rejoiced in Heaven last night
I heard my daddy pray "Dear God, make it right"
He was smiling and singing with tears in his eyes
While Mother with the angels rejoiced last night

===== The Louvin Brothers - Kentucky =====  
Kentucky, you are the dearest land outside of Heaven to me
Kentucky, your laurels and your redbud trees
When I die, I want to rest upon your graceful mountain so high
Kentucky, that is where God will look for me
Kentucky, I miss the voices singing in the silvery moonlight
Kentucky, I miss the hound dog chasing coon
I know that my mother, dad and sweetheart all are waiting for me
Kentucky, I will be coming soon

===== The Louvin Brothers - The River Of Jordan =====  
To the River Of Jordan our Savior went one day
And we read that John The Baptist met Him there
And when John baptized Jesus in Jordan's rushing waters
The mighty power of God filled the air
I'm on my way to the River Of Jordan
Gonna wade right in to the rushing waters
I'm going down to the River Of Jordan
And let the cool waters cleanse my soul
King Naaman was stricken with dreaded leprosy
And he sent for the man of God to pray
But Elisha said to Naaman "go dip yourself in Jordan"
And let the cool waters wash your spots away
So he went right down to the River Of Jordan
He waded right in the rushing waters
He dipped himself in the River Of Jordan
And the cool waters made him whole
Oh the River Of Jordan is many miles away
And this mighty river I may never see
But I'll find myself an alter in an old fashioned church
And my River Of Jordan that will be

===== The Louvin Brothers - The Weapon of Prayer =====  
In that land across the sea, there's a job for you and me
Though our presence there may not be found
We must stay standing there on the battle line and pray
We must never lay our weapons down
We don't have to be a soldier in a uniform
To be of service over there
While the boys so bravely stand with the weapons made by hand
Let us trust and use the weapon of prayer
Many thousand miles away, someone sheds their blood today
With a heart so true and brave, they've gone
To a war that's yours and mine, let us join the battle line
With a weapon that will save our home
When the planes and tanks and guns have done all that they can do
When the mighty bombs have rained and failed
Still the helpful hand above holds the weapon made of love
And against him none on earth prevail

===== The Louvin Brothers - The Kneeling Drunkard’s Plea =====  
"Lord, have mercy on me"
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in heaven looked down
I went down by an old country church
I saw the drunkard stagger and lurch
And as he reached his mother's grave
I saw that drunkard kneel and pray
"Bring my darling boy to me"
Was his mother's dying plea
And as he staggered through the gate
Alas, he came just one day too late
Three years have passed since she went away
Her son is sleeping beside her today
And I know that in heaven, his mother he'll see
For God has heard that drunkard's plea

===== The Louvin Brothers - The Christian Life =====  
I like the Christian life
My buddies tell me that I should have waited
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
But I am happy and I sing with pride
I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasures in things I despise
My buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus
But I still love them they burden my heart
I'll try to lead them to walk in the light

===== The Louvin Brothers - The Drunkard’s Doom =====  
It was on one dark and starless night
I heard and saw an awful sight
The lightning flashed, the thunder rolled
Across my dark denial soul
I saw a gulf form down below
Where all the dying drunkards go
I saw another weeping crowd
Bloodshotten eyes and voices loud
"Come here young man, we'll give you room
This is the whiskey seller's doom"
I started there, got there at last
I thought I'd take a social glass
But every time I started in
I thought about the drunkard's den
I smashed it down and left the place
I went to seek redeeming Grace
I felt like Paul who once did pray
For God to wash his sins away
I started home to change my life
To see my loving neglected wife
I found her weeping over the bed
Because our infant babe was dead
I told her not to cry or weep
Our little baby had gone to sleep
It's little soul had passed away
To ring with Christ an endless day
I took her by her lilly white hand
She was so weak she could not stand
I knelt her down and prayed a prayer
That God might save and bless us there
And now I live a better life
In a Christian home with a loving wife

===== The Louvin Brothers - Lorene =====  
Lorene, Lorene, write me a letter
Answer the last one I wrote to you
Lorene, I hope you're still waiting
But till I ?? this ??
I know many times you have started to write
Darling, I wonder what's taking your time
Lorene, you seem to be near me
But your last letter is way overdue
Lorene, stop me from hurting
All it would take is a letter from you
Lorene, you said I could trust you
But your last letter is way overduе
If you found another since I've been away
Don't lеt me return, for it's best that I stay
Lorene, I feel I have lost you
For your last letter is way overdue
Lorene, Lorene

===== The Louvin Brothers - Almost Persuaded =====  
Almost persuaded now to believe
Almost persuaded, Christ to receive
Seems now some soul to say, go, spirit, go thy way
Some more convenient day, on thee I'll call
Almost persuaded, come, come today
Almost persuaded, turn not away
Jesus invites you, angels are lingering near
Prayers rise from hearts so dear, oh wanderer, come
Almost persuaded, harvest is past
Almost persuaded, doom comes at last
Almost cannot avail, almost is but to fail
Sad, sad, that bitter wail, almost, but lost

===== The Louvin Brothers - Brown’s Ferry Blues =====  
Hard little papa can't stand his ground
He was a good papa, but he's done gone down
Lord, lord, he got them brown's ferry blues
Hard little papa standing in the rain
If the world was corny, couldn't buy a grain
Hard little papa countin' his toes
You can smell his feet wherever he goes
Hard little papa can't do his stub
The trouble with him, he's been too rough
Two old maids playing in the sand
Each one wishing that the other was a man
Lord, lord, they got them brown's ferry blues
Two old maids done lost their style
If you wanna be lucky, you got to smile
Early to bed, early to rise
If your girl goes out with other guys
Lord, lord, got them brown's ferry blues
If you don't believe it, try it yourself
I tried it, but I got left
I got a girl in the Cumberland Gap
She's got a boy who calls me Pap
I don't smoke and I don't chew
And I don't go with the gals that do
I wanna go home, but there ain't no use
For the jailer-man, he won't turn me loose
Had a good time when I was free
But I let the wrong thing get the best of me

===== Tom T. Hall - Week In The Country Jail =====  
One time I spent a week inside a little country jail
And I don't guess I'll ever live it down
I was sittin' at a red light when these two men came and got me
And said that I was speeding through their town
Well, they said,tomorrow morning you can see the judge then go
They let me call one person on the phone
I thought I'd be there overnight so I just called my boss
To tell him I'd be off but not for long
Well, they motioned me inside a cell with seven other guys
One little barred up window in the rear
My cellmates said if they had let me bring some money in
We ought to send the jailer for some beer
Well, I had to pay him double 'cause he was the man in charge
And the jailer's job was not the best in town
Later on his wife brought hot bologna, eggs and gravy
The first day I was there I turned it down
Well, next morning they just let us sleep but I was up real early
Wonderin' when I'd get my release
Later on we got more hot bologna, eggs and gravy
And by now I wasn't quite so hard to please
Two days later when I thought that I had been forgotten
The sheriff came in chewin' on a straw
He said, where is the guy who thinks that this is indianapolis?
I'd like to talk to him about the law
Well, I told him who I was and told him I was working steady
And I really should be gettin' on my way
That part about me bein' who I was did not impress him
He said, the judge'll be here any day
The jailer had a wife and let me tell you she was awful
But she brought that hot bologna every day
And after seven days she got to lookin' so much better
I asked her if she'd like to run away
The next mornin' that old judge took every nickel that I had
And he said, son, let this teach you not to race
The jailer's wife was smilin' from the window as I left
In thirty minutes I was out of state

===== Tom T. Hall - Homecoming =====
I guess I should've written, dad
To let you know that I was coming home
I've been gone so many years
I didn't realize you had a phone
I saw your cattle coming in
Boy, they're looking mighty fat and slick
I saw Fred at the service station
Told me that his wife was awful sick
You heard my record on the radio
Oh, well, it's just another song
But I've got a hit recorded
And it'll be out on the market 'fore too long
I got this ring in Mexico
And no, it didn't cost me quite a bunch
When you're in the business that I'm in
The people call it puttin' up a front
I know I've lost a little weight
And I guess I am looking kind of pale
If you didn't know me better, dad
You'd think that I'd just gotten out of jail
No, we don't ever call them beer joints
Nightclubs are the places that I work
You meet a lot of people there
But no, there ain't much chance of gettin' hurt
I'm sorry that I couldn't be here with you all
When mama passed away
I was on the road and when they came and told me
It was just too late
I drove by the grave to see her
Boy, that really is a pretty stone
I'm glad that Fred and Jan are here
It's better than you being here alone
Well, I knew you was gonna ask me
Who the lady is that's sleeping in the car
That's just a girl who works for me
And, man, she plays a pretty mean guitar
We worked in San Antone last night
She didn't even have the time to dress
She drove me down from Nashville
And to tell the truth, I guess she needs the rest
Well, dad, I gotta go
We got a dance to work in Cartersville tonight
Let me take your number down
I'll call you and I promise you I'll write
Now you be good
And don't be chasin' all those pretty women that you know
And by the way
If you see Barbara Walker, tell her that I said "hello"

===== Flatt & Scruggs - Mr. Tambourine Man =====  
Hey Mr Tambourine man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into the sand
Vanished from my hand left me blindly here to stand
But still not sleeping my weariness amazes me
I'm branded on my feet and I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty streets too dead for dreaming
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped and my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step wait only for my bootheels to go wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade cast your dancing spell my way I promise to go under it
Hey Mr Tambourine man...

===== Bobby Bare - City Boy, Country Born =====  
I look out on the grey of New York City
To see some children playing in the snow
Central Park in winter should look pretty
But New York ain't a place for kids to grow
And my memory takes me back again to winters that I've seen
Fields and wooded hills where snow could fall and keep it's clean
Where I'd wake unto the wonder of the West Virginia morn
City boy
Country born
And I watch the garbage scows plow up the river
Filled with things New Yorkers throw away
I watch the skinny dipping children and I shiver
Lord, that Hudson River ain't no place to play
And my memory takes me back again to rivers that I've seen
Lazy country rivers that just flow and feed the green
You can fish 'em, you can drink 'em, you can swim 'em when your warm
And I see the heart of New York City mothers
As they hurry home across the Brooklyn Bridge
To feed their children dixie cups of instant coffee
And frozen TV dinners front the fridge
And my memory takes me back again to dinners that I've seen
Home cured crispy bacon, buttered corn and country beans
And a cup of mama's coffee, cooking stoves that kept me warm

===== Kenny Rogers - Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Is In) =====  
I woke up this morning with the sundown shining in
I found my mind in a brown paper bag within
I tripped on a cloud and fell-a eight miles high
I tore my mind on a jagged sky
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in
I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in
I watched myself crawling out as I was a-crawling in
I got up so tight I couldn't unwind
I saw so much I broke my mind
Someone painted April Fool in big black letters on a Dead End sign
I had my foot on the gas as I left the road and blew out my mind
Eight miles outta Memphis and I got no spare
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere
I said I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
Yeah
yeah
oh-yeah

===== Tom T. Hall - That's How I Got To Memphis =====
If you love somebody enough
You'll follow wherever they go
That's how I got to Memphis
You'll go where your heart wants to go
I know if you'd seen her, you'd tell me 'cause you are my friend
I've got to find her and find out the trouble she's in
If you tell me that she's not here
I'll follow the trail of her tears
She would get mad and she used to say
That she'd come back to Memphis someday
I haven't eaten a bite
Or slept for three days and nights
I've got to find her and tell her that I love her so
I'll never rest till I find out why she had to go
Thank you for your precious time
Forgive me if I start to cryin'

===== Tom T. Hall - Cloudy Day =====
I never did like that apartment
It was not a place I like to be
In summertime the place was hot
In wintertime I'd sit around and freeze
I never did like that apartment seems to me
It always smell like food
People down the hall complained
Because I liked to pick and sing
And anyway the rent was overdue
Cloudy day this is my cloudy day
One for you and one for him o
One for her and one for them
I've forgot the number of the Interstate that brought me to this town
I've been here for seven months
And still I do not know my way around
Well I'd like to find a quiet place
And trouble is I don't know where it's at
I don't know which way is best but I think I'll be headin' west
So I'll be walkin' where the land is flat
I've know people higher up the ladder
Who can always pick and choose
Anything they want to be or anyplace they go to just can't lose
It doesn't matter who you are
We all must have a cloudy day some time
Days that we can't seem to win
Days that we ain't got a friend
We all have days and I guess this is mine
One for you and one for him one for her and one for them

===== Tom T. Hall - Shame On The Rain =====
Shame on the rain for making me twice as blue
It's raining in my heart on my window too
Days just like this have put out the flame
I've got that smoke in my eyes shame on the rain
You'd think it's enough just to know that she's gone
With my kind of luck it will rain from now on
After I'd lost such a heartbreaking game
You'd think the sun would shine shame on the rain
Shame on the rain for adding to my unrest
She took the sun it figures I guess
I have my share of sorrow and pain
Look what a day it is shame on the rain

===== Tom T. Hall - Highways =====
Highways take me everywhere
I want to go with one exception standing
That road leads into the quiet places in the shadows of your mind
The beaten path of common words
Can only lead us to misunderstanding
I believe that I can see the love for you that is a greater kind
Highways take me over the mountains
Into the valleys and out through the plains
Wanting to be in your heart's understanding
I travel each highway in vain
Highways only take me into places where the average of the crowd goes
Where they affix the standard on the language
And emotions of the love
Highways never reach above the ground
And cannot know the things a cloud knows
In a million volumes they have never written to express my love

===== Tom T. Hall - Forbidden Flowers =====
There are flowers in the cities some with color some are pale
You may find them on the sidewalks
Some are wilted but still for sale
You can pick forbidden flowers
There are ways and there are means
If you pick forbidden flowers you may shatter someone's dream
There are flowers in the country soft to touch and sweet to smell
There are dangers in the flowers pick them wisely know them well
You may shatter someone's dream

===== Tom T. Hall - Ain't Got The Time =====
I can tell your heart's been broken in two
You are looking for a shoulder
I've found out that other people's tears
Just seem to make me older
I'd like to help with your broken heart
Really I think it's a crime
But I ain't got the time, ain't got the time
All that I can give you is a well wish
I hate to be that way I know that it's selfish
But baby I've got a destiny to meet
And I know it's on down the line
Ain't got the time ain't got the time
I can tell that you've been hurt pretty bad
You need someone to cry to
You're like a bird with the broken wing
And you need some place to fly to
But I've found out from life
That I can't live nobody's but mine

===== Tom T. Hall - Ballad of Forty Dollars =====
The man who preached the funeral
Said it really was a simple way to die
He laid down to rest one afternoon
And never opened up his eyes
They hired me and Fred and Joe
To dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours
And I guess we must've drunk a case of beer
I guess I ought to go and watch them put him down
But I don't own a suit
And anyway when they start talkin' about
The fire in Hell, well, I get spooked
So, I'll just sit here in my truck
And act like I don't know him when they pass
Anyway, when they're all through
I've got to go to work and mow the grass
Well, here they come and who's that
Ridin' in that big ol' shiny limousine
Look at all that chrome, I do believe
That that's the sharpest thing I've seen
That must belong to his great uncle
Someone said he owned a big ol' farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down
And look it over, that won't do no harm
Well, that must be the widow in the car
And would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress
You know, some women do look good in black
Well, he's not even in the ground
And they say that his truck is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard
But you can't tell too much behind the veil
Well, listen, ain't that pretty
When the bugler plays the Military Taps
I think that when you's in the war
They always hide 'n play a song like that
Well, here I am and there they go
And I guess you'd just call it my bad luck
I hope he rests in peace, the trouble is
The fellow owes me forty bucks

===== Tom T. Hall - I Washed My Face In The Morning Dew =====
The first strange town I was ever in
The county was hanging a man
Nobody cared if he lived or died
And I just didn't understand
So I washed my face in the morning dew
Bathed my soul in the sun
Washed my face in the morning dew
And kept on moving along
The second strange town I was in
They were laughing at a poor crippled man
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street
The third strange town that I was in
Was settled, peaceful and nice
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer
And to me, it didn't seem right
Someday, times are bound to change
It can't be very far
And each injustice I have seen
Will come before the bar
Then I'll wash my face in the morning dew
Bathe my soul in the sun
Wash my face in the morning dew
And my journey will be done

===== Tom T. Hall - Picture of Your Mother =====
My little girl and I lost Mama just three years ago
And now that she is older there are things she wants to know
She said, "Please Daddy tell me 'bout my mother 'cause I miss her."
I said, "Get pen and paper and I'll help your draw her picture."
I said, "First draw a heart so big there's room for little else
Then write a million for the things that she denied herself
Draw a rose the kind of which there'll never be another
And when you finish you will have a picture of your mother
"If you want to make the picture even more complete
You could draw a little cottage, draw it nice and neat
Draw a bright and shining sun up in the sky above
But then again I guess its pretty hard to draw my love
"So draw a heart so big that there is room for little else
Write a million for the things that she denied herself
And when you finish you will have a picture of your mother."

===== Tom T. Hall - World The Way I Want It =====
I'd feed all those hungry children down by the tracks
I'd give Mom and Dad some of their young years back
I'd let all those crippled children get up and run
I'd take the blind and lead them out into the shining sun
If I could have the world the way I want it
What a day tomorrow could be
I would set these children free
I'd pay the debts of all the poor and let them start anew
I'd find each man who wants to work a decent job to do
I'd give hope to the hopeless and I'd give the sick their health
I'd give the high and mighty heart to share the nation's wealth
I'd take all those sad and hungry people off of the street
Each weary walking traveler would have shoes upon his feet
I'd find the young men in the far off places of the world
I'd bring them home to see their fathers mothers and their girls

===== Tom T. Hall - Over & Over Again =====
Over and over say you forgive me for the crazy fool I've been
Over and over I'll be sorry over and over again
Would I be untrue to you dear no no never again
That's one lesson I'll remember over and over again
Back together now and forever ever more will I be true
Over and over I'm gonna prove it over and over to you
Over and over say you forgive me I'll be faithful to the end
I will prove I can be trusted over and over again
Would I be untrue to you dear no no never again...
Over and over over and over over and over over and over

===== Tom T. Hall - Beauty Is A Fading Flower =====
Beauty is a fading flower
Tomorrow it may be gone
Love goes on and on
Today everybody wants you
Brand new is better than old
Who will want you tomorrow?
There's beauty in your soul
You have never known love
You've never learned to hate
When these emotions find you
They'll leave lines in your face
Love is not all beauty
Love is not all form
Winter wilts the flowers
Love can keep you warm

===== Tom T. Hall - Strawberry Farms =====
Summer comes laughing to Strawberry Farms
Have you ever been there, where the wind never blows
Summer comes early to Strawberry Farms
Oh the sun always shines, but an orphan can't go
My mother is dead, she doesn't care where I go
My father left a long, long time ago
I had me a frog, he never whined or cried
I kept him in my pocket and he died
Bobby had a brother, he got killed in the war
I asked him but he didn't know what for
My mother was pretty, she had long black hair
Once, she promised me a teddy bear
Oh the sun always shines, and things don't die

===== Tom T. Hall - Shoeshine Man =====
Well I met a man in Montgomery Alabama
I was waitin' on a bus and he was shinin' shoes and I heard him say
I'm a shoeshine man number one in the land
A shoeshine man make you shine where you stand
Leave me a tip if you can I'm a shoeshine man
Well I can sing I can dance I can play the harmonica too
I got a brand new thing on the South Side Montgomery Blues
You better stick around and watch me cause I'm an entertainin' fool
Well I learned my trade from that rag-poppin' daddy o'mine
He shined twelve alligators made a hundred dollar bill one time
And when the meat gets scarce I shine two or three pairs for a dime
I had a girl that helped me she had a lotta hoochy coochy ways
She was bumping and grinding paid that girl a dollar a day
But she was shy on age and the law come and took her away

===== Tom T. Hall - Kentucky In The Morning =====
I will sing of a place that you may have seen in the eastern half of our land so green
Where the sun is warm and the sky is blue
And the love of a girl is true
Kentucky in the morning trimmed in green and blue
Kentucky in the morning I was only passing through
There's a bird that sings something sweet and pure
That tune goes on while the beat sounds sure
Oh if I could hum that old song today I could chase my blues away
Kentucky in the morning
Oh I can't recall how I came to go by Kentucky shores on the Ohio
As I crossed that bridge I looked back to say
I will sing you a song someday

===== Tom T. Hall - Nashville Is A Groovy Little Town =====
My plane set down in nashville at a quarter after 2
A little while and I'd be on my way back home to you
While I was waitin' for my flight, got out and looked around
Nashville is a groovy little town
I met some entertainers and they had an extra girl
I told them I was just a tourist out to see the world
From one place to another, yes we really made the rounds
Next day they all took me in just like they did before
I guess I'm trying to tell you I won't be home anymore
Now this may sound poetic, but I'm happy as a clown
Remember how I used to sit and drink and play guitar
And I'd get up and sing for all those folks at jody's bar
Well I found out it ain't too bad, the way I pick and sound
You know that nest egg that we buried in the bank awhile
Take it out and spend it darlin', dress yourself in style
You have always been a swinger and now I won't be around
I've got myself a little shack out on ol' hickory lake
And now and then I get a gig and buy myself a steak
Why'know, they published one of my old songs, they're showing it around
You remember all those tranquilizers that I used to take
Well I'm not on those anymore, I'm on old hickory lake
So when you start cryin' here's the best one-liner I have found
What else you got? Yes, nashville is a groovy little town

===== Tom T. Hall - Margie's At The Lincoln Park Inn =====
My name's in the paper where I took the Boy Scouts to hike
My hands are all dirty from working on my little boy's bike
The preacher came by and I talked for a minute with him
My wife's in the kitchen and Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn
And I know why she's there 'cause I've been there before
But I made a promise that I wouldn't cheat anymore
I tried to ignore it but I know she's in there my friend
My mind's on a number and Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn
Next Sunday it's my turn to speak to the young people's class
They expect answers to all of the questions they ask
What would they say if I spoke on a modern day sin
And all of the Margie's at all of the Lincoln Park Inns
The bike is all fixed and my little boy is in bed asleep
His little ol' puppy is curled in a ball at my feet
My wife's baking cookies to feed to the bridge club again
I'm almost out of cigarettes and Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn

===== Tom T. Hall - Carter Boys =====
The Carter boys were born one and after another in a little old country place
I was the last and the death of my mother
And I know it was a pretty bad trace
We'd get to drinking I'd do the singing
And they taught me to chase girls and cuss
We played poker I'd do the dealing
I was the only one we could trust
And there were six of us all together
And that's how we stood all the time
Six of us all together the Carter boys were brothers of mine
We had an old car that we kept tied together
With pieces of baling wire and hope
Well they knew when we got there and they knew when we left
They could tell by the noise and the smoke
Anytime the sheriff had nothing to do
He'd get out and chase us around
The old women prayed the old men laughed
And the middle aged people all frowned
There were six of us all together
Daddy was a preacher and the Lord knows he tried
Gave us everything he could afford
We lost a lotta battles but daddy always said
The only thing we feared was the Lord
Well as I look back through the long lean years
I wonder how we ever survived
All of that hard work all of those women
And all of those pistols and knives

===== Bill Monroe - Blue Moon of Kentucky =====
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shinin'
Shine on the one that's gone and proved untrue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
It was on a moonlight night
The stars shining bright
They whispered from on high
Your love has said goodbye
Shine on the one that's gone and said goodbye

===== Bill Monroe - Lord Lead Me On =====
When the way seems dark and long
And no person at the door
Hold to my hand dear Lord I pray
Give me grace to shout and shine
Ever in the life divine
Lord lead me on from day to day
Oh lead me on, (Lead me on)
From day to day (Day to day)
I want to walk, (I want to walk)
The holy way (Holy way)
Oh friends forsake, (Friends forsake)
Me all along (All along)
I asked the Lord, (I asked the Lord)
To lead me on
In this world of doubt and gloom
When all flowers start to bloom
I have put my faith in thee
'Til the homely hour shall be
When old age is stealing on
And my strength is almost gone
Surely thou will n'er forsake
And in heaven I'll awake

===== Bill Monroe - In The Pines =====
The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab passed by at nine
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And we shiver when the cold wind blows
I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away
A long steel rail and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home
Little girl, little girl, what have I done
That makes you treat me so
You caused me to weep, you caused me to mourn
You caused me to leave my home
My father was an engineer
Died a mile out of town
His head was found in the driving gear
But his body was never found

===== Bill Monroe - I'll Meet You In The Morning =====
I'll meet you in the morning by the bright riverside
When all sorrow has drifted away
I'll be standin' at the portals when the gates open wide
At the close of life's long weary day
I'll meet you in the morning with a how do you do
And we'll sit down by the river and when rapture of the planet renewed
You'll know me in the morning by the smile that I wear
When I meet you in the morning in the city that is built four square
I will meet you in the morning in the sweet by and by
And exchange the old cross for a crown
There will be no disappointments and nobody shall die
In that land when life's sun goeth down

===== Bill Monroe - Turkey in the Straw =====
Well, I had an old hen and she had a wooden leg
Just the best old hen that ever laid and egg
She laid more eggs than any hen on the farm
But another little drink wouldn't do her any harm
Turkey in the hay, in the hay, hay, hay!
Turkey in the straw, in the straw, straw, straw!
Pick 'em up, shake 'em up, any way at all
And hit up a tune called 'Turkey in the Straw'
Well, I hitched up the wagon and I drove down the road
With a two horse wagon and a four horse load
Well I cracked my whip and the lead horse sprung
And I said "Goodbye" to the wagon tongue
Well, if frogs had wings and snakes had hair
And automobiles went flyin' through the air
Well, if watermelons grew on a huckleberry vine
We'd still have winter in the summer time
Oh, I went out to milk and I didn't know how
I milked an old goat instead of a cow
A monkey sittin' there on a pile of straw
A-winkin' his eyes at his mother-in-law
Well, I come to the river and I couldn't get across
So I paid five dollars for an old blind horse
Well, he wouldn't go ahead and he wouldn't stand still
So he went up and down like an old saw mill

===== Bill Monroe - Footprints in the Snow =====
Now some folks like the summertime when the they can walk about
Strolling through the meadow green it's pleasant there no doubt
But give me the wintertime when the snow is on the ground
For I found her when the snow was on the ground
I traced her little footprints in the snow
I found her little footprints in the snow, Lord
I bless that happy day that Nellie lost her way
I dropped in to see her there was a big round moon
Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning soon
I found her little footprints and I traced them through the snow
I found her when the snow was on the ground
Now she's up in heaven, she's with the angel band
I know I'm going to meet her in that promised land
But every time the snow falls it brings back memories

===== Bill Monroe - Cryin’ Holy Unto The Lord =====
Crying holy unto the Lord
Oh, if I could I surely would
Stand on the rock where Moses stood
Sinners, run and hide your face
Go and run into the rocks and hide your face
The rocks got no hiding place
Lord, I ain't no sinner now
I've been to the river and I've been baptized
And I ain't no sinner now
Lord, I ain't no stranger now
I've been introduced to the Father and the Son
And I ain't no stranger now

===== Bill Monroe - The Glory Land Way =====
I'm in the way, the bright and shining way
I'm in the Glory Land way (Glory Land way)
Telling the world that Jesus saves today
Yes, I'm in the Glory Land way (Glory Land way)
Chorus:
Heaven is nearer and the way groweth clearer
For I'm in the Glory Land way (Glory Land way)
Listen to the call, the gospel call today
Get in the Glory Land way (Glory Land way)
Wand'rers, come home, o hasten to obey
Onward I go rejoicing in His love
Soon I shall see Him in that home above
O, I'm in the Glory Land way (Glory Land way

===== Bill Monroe - Y’all Come =====
When you live in the country
Everybody is your neighbor
On this one thing you can rely
They'll all come to see you
And never, ever leave you
Sayin' you all come to see us by and by
Y'all come! (Y'all come!)
Well, you all come to see us now and then
Well, you all come to see us when you can
Kin folks a-comin'
They're comin' by the dozen
Eatin' everything from soup to hay
And right after dinner
They ain't looking any thinner
And here's what you hear them say
Grandma's a-wishin'
They'd come to the kitchen
And help do the dishes right away
But they all start a-leavin'
But even though she's grievin'
You can still hear Grandma say

===== Bill Monroe - Uncle Pen =====
Oh the people would come from far away
They'd dance all night till the break of day
When the caller hollered "do-se-do"
You knew Uncle Pen was ready to go
Late in the evening about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing
He played an old piece he called "Soldier's Joy"
And the one called "The Boston Boy"
The greatest of all was "Jenny Lynn"
To me that's where the fiddle begins
I'll never forget that mournful day
When Uncle Pen was called away
They hung up his fiddle, they hung up his bow
They knew it was time for him to go

===== Bill Monroe - A Good Woman’s Love =====
I was a rover, on land and on sea
'til a good woman's love made a new man of me
Life had no meaning, it was so incomplete
'til a good woman's love put me back on my feet
Still a-roamin' I go home in the evening and she's waiting there
And I know that no matter what happens she'll always care
And when night falls and the moon shines above
I'm a man with a dream and a good woman's love

===== Bill Monroe - Molly and Tenbrooks =====
Run, oh Molly run; run, oh Molly run
Tenbrooks gonna beat you, bright shinin' sun
To the bright shinin' sun, oh Lord, to the bright shinin' sun
Tenbrooks was a big bay horse, he wore that shaggy mane
He run all around Memphis; he beat the Memphis train
Beat the Memphis train, oh Lord, beat the Memphis train
See that train a-comin', it's comin' 'round the curve
See old Tenbrooks runnin'; he's strainin' every nerve
Strainin' every nerve, oh Lord, strainin' every nerve
Out in California where Molly done as she pleased
Come back to old Kentucky, got beat with all ease
Beat with all ease, oh Lord, beat with all ease
Kyper, Kyper, you're not a-ridin' right
Molly's a-beatin' old Tenbrooks, clear out of sight
Clear out of sight, oh Lord, clear out of sight
Kyper, Kyper, Kyper my son
Give old Tenbrooks the bridle, let old Tenbrooks run
Let old Tenbrooks run, oh Lord, let old Tenbrooks run
The womens all a-laughin'; the children all a-cryin'
Men's all a-hollerin'; old Tenbrooks a-flyin'
Old Tenbrooks a-flyin', oh Lord, old Tenbrooks a-flyin'
Go and catch old Tenbrooks and hitch him in the shade
We're gonna bury old Molly in a coffin ready-made
Coffin ready-made, oh Lord, coffin ready-made

===== Bill Monroe - Little Cabin Home On The Hill =====
Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems there's a longing for you still
All I have to do now is sit alone and cry
In our little cabin home on the hill
Oh, someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
Just to listen to the rain beat on my window pane
I hope you are happy tonight as you are
But in my heart there's a longing for you still
I just keep it there so I won't be alone
Now when you have come to the end of the way
And find there's no more happiness for you
Just let you thoughts turn back once more if you will
To our little cabin home on the hill

===== Bill Monroe - Kentucky Waltz =====
We were waltzing that night in Kentucky
'Neath the beautiful harvest moon
And I was the boy who was lucky
But it all ended too soon
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
I can see your smiling face
And I long once more for your embrace
In that beautiful Kentucky waltz

===== Bill Monroe - All the Good Times Are Past and Gone =====
I wish to the Lord I'd never been born
Or died when I was young
I never would have seen your sparklin' blue eyes
Or heard your lyin' tongue
All the good times are past and gone
All the good times are o'er
Little darling, don't you weep no more
See that lonesome turtle dove
Come flyin' from pine to pine
He's mournin' for his own true love
Just like I mourn for mine
Come back, come back my own true love
Come and stay awhile with me
For if ever I've had a friend in this world
You've been a friend to me

===== Bill Monroe - In Despair =====
You made me love you, you made me want you
And now I need you all the time
My heart is sad and I'm so lonely
Each night and day you're on my mind
You broke me heart my little darling
When I called for you, you had another there
But a broken heart will keep on crying
I know you know, I'm in despair
You made me forget of all the others
You made me forget of all the past
And I thought sweetheart you really loved me
My friends told me it would never last

===== Bill Monroe - Back Up And Push =====
Did you ever wonder about the riddle
What kind of spirit lives in a fiddle
Well, it's old Satan, right there a waiting
Or are you tuned with the angel band
Well, you back up and push
Back up and push
Back off of sin and let Glory in
You can't go wrong singing this song
Back up and push away
Now back up and push
If you let the devil, play on your senses
Prepare to suffer the consequences
The foolish measure of the worldly pleasure
Can only drag you to the roaring fire

===== Bill Monroe - I’m Working On A Building =====
I'm a working on building
For my Lord, for my Lord
It's a holy ghost building
If I was a gambler, I tell you what I'd do
I'd quit my gambling and I'd work on the building, too
If I was a drunkard I tell you what I would do
I'd quit my drinking and I'd work on the building too
If I was a preacher I tell you what I would do
I would keep on preaching and work on the building too

===== Bill Monroe - It’s Mighty Dark To Travel =====
It's mighty dark for me to travel
For my sweetheart she is gone
The road is rough and filled with gravel
But I must journey on and on
To me she was a little angel
Sent down to me from God above
And on the day that I first met her
Then I told her of my love
Many a night we strolled together
Talking of our love so fair
My love for her will never vanish
Oh I know I'll meet her there
Traveling down this lonesome highway
Thinking of my love who's gone
Knowing soon we'll be together
She's the only love I've known

===== Bill Monroe - My Little Georgia Rose =====
Now come and listen to my story
My story that I know is true
A little rose bloomed in Georgia
With marigold and a heart of gold
Way down in the Blue Ridge mountains
Way down where the tall pines grow
There's my sweetheart of the mountain
She's my little Georgia rose
My mother left her with another
A carefree life she had planned
The baby now is a lady
The one her mother couldn't stand
We often sang old songs together
I watched her do her little part
She smiled at me when I would tell her
That she was my sweetheart

===== Alan Jackson - It's Five O'Clock Somewhere =====
The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow
An' so am I
Work day passes like molasses in wintertime
But it's July
I'm gettin' paid by the hour, an' older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him somethin'
I think I'll just call it a day
Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
Make it a "Hurricane" before I go insane
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere
Oh, this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
An' half the night
Tomorrow mornin', I know there'll be hell to pay
Hey, but that's alright
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
Our Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone’s for me
You can tell 'em I just sailed away
And pour me somethin' tall an' strong
I could pay off my tab, pour myself in a cab
An' be back to work before two
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do?
Funny you should ask Alan, I'd say:
"Pour me somethin' tall an' strong
It's only half-past twelve but I don't care"
He don't care
And I don't care
What time zone am I on? What country am I in?
It doesn't matter, it's five o'clock somewhere
It's always on five in Margaritaville, come to think of it
Yeah, I heard that
You been, there haven't you?
Yessir
I seen your boat there
I've been to Margaritaville a few times
Alright, that's good
Stumbled all the way back
Okay, just wanna make sure you can keep it between the navigational beacons
Ha ha ha ha, between the buoys, I tell you
Alright. Well, it's five o'clock. Let's go somewhere
I'm ready, crank it up
Let's get out of here
I'm gone

===== Alan Jackson - Chattahoochee =====
Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little about love
Aw haw
Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willin' but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home
Never had a plan just a living for the minute
Yeah-eee
That's right

===== Alan Jackson - Little Bitty =====
Have a little love on a little honeymoon
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard
A little bitty dog and a little bitty car
Well, it's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while
A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
It'll grow up in a little bitty town
Big yellow bus and little bitty books
It all started with a little bitty look
Hehyeee!
You know you got a job and a little bitty cheque
A six pack of beer and television set
Little bitty world goes around and around
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound
A good ole boy and a pretty little girl
Start all over in a little bitty world
Little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
It's all part of a little bitty scheme
It's alright to be little bitty

===== Alan Jackson - Drive (For Daddy Gene) =====
It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was eighteen feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, "You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides"
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal
It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say "A little slower son, you're doing just fine"
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say
It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
And he'd say "Turn it left" and "Steer it right"
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
Oh he let me drive

===== Alan Jackson - Remember When =====
Remember when
I was young and so were you
And time stood still and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried
We vowed the vows and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, and it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, and there was hurt
Old ones died and the new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each other's hearts
The sound of little feet
Was the music we danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up
Thirty seemed so old
Now looking back, it's just a stepping stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we'd do it all again
We said when we turned gray
When the children grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had
And we'll remember when

===== Alan Jackson - Gone Country =====
She's been playing in a room on the strip
For ten years in Vegas
Every night she looks in the mirror
And she only ages
She's been readin' about Nashville, and all the records
That everybody's buyin'
Says, I'm a simple girl myself
Grew up on Long Island
So she packs her bags to try her hand
Says this might be my last chance
She's gone country
Look at them boots
Back to her roots
A new kind of suit
Here she comes
Well the folk scene's dead
But he's holding out in the Village
He's been writin' songs, speakin' out against
Wealth and privilege
He says, I don't believe in money
But a man could make him a killin'
Cause some of that stuff don't sound
Much different than Dylan
I hear down there
It's changed, you see
Well, they're not as backward
As they used to be
He's gone country
Lack to his roots
Here he comes
Well, he commutes to L.A
But he's got a house in the Valley
But the bills are pilin' up
And the pop scene just ain't on the rally
And he says, honey, I'm a serious composer
Schooled in voice and composition
But with the crime and the smog these days
This ain't no place for children
Lord, it sounds so easy
This shouldn't take long
Be back in the money
In no time at all
Back to his roots
Yeah, he's gone country
A new kind of walk
A new kind of talk
Oh, back to his roots
Everybody's gone country
Yeah, we've gone county
The whole world's gone country
We're gone
Songwriter:  Bob McDill

===== Alan Jackson - Good Time =====
Work, work all week long
Punching that clock from dusk till dawn
Counting the days till Friday night
That's when all the conditions are right
For a good time
I need a good time
I've been working all week
And I'm tired and I don't want to sleep
And I want to have fun
It's time for a good time
I cashed my check, cleaned my truck
Put on my hat, forgot about work
Sun going down, head across town
Pick up my baby and turn it around
Good time
Ahh, I need a good time
Pig in the ground, beer on ice
Just like ole Hank taught us about
Singing along, Bocephus songs
Rowdy friends, all night long
Lord, we're having a good time
Whew!
Heel toe, do-si-do
Scooting our boots, swinging doors
B & D, Kix and Dunn
Honking tonk heaven, Double shotgun
Cause
Shot of Tequila, beer on tap
Sweet southern woman set on my lap
G with an O, O with a D
T with an I and an M and an E
And a good time
Shhheww, good time
Ahh, turn it up now!
A shot of Tequila
Beer on tap
A good looking woman
To set on my lap
A G with an O, an O with a D
A T with an I an M with an E
That spells good time
A good time
Ohh
Twelve o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock four
Five o'clock we know we're that's going to go
Closing the door, shutting them down
Head for that Waffle House way across town
Good time?
Ohh, we're having a good time
Ohh, yea, a good time
Yea, a good time

===== Alan Jackson - Livin' On Love =====
Two young people without a thing
Say some vows and spread their wings
And settle down with just what they need
Livin' on love
She don't care 'bout what's in style
She just likes the way he smiles
It takes more than marble and tile
Livin' on love, buyin' on time
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime
Just like an old fashion story book rhyme
It sounds simple, that's what you're thinkin'
But love can walk through fire without blinkin'
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Two old people without a thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side in that front porch swing
He can't see anymore
She can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand they'll walk through that door
Just livin' on love
It sounds simple that's what you're thinkin'
But, it sounds simple that's what you're thinkin'
No it doesn't take much when you get enough

===== Alan Jackson - Country Boy =====
Excuse me ma'am, I saw you walking
I turned around, I'm not a stalker
Where you going? Maybe I can help you
My tank is full, I'd be obliged to take you
'Cause I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Climb in my bed and I'll take you for a ride
Up city streets, down country roads
I can get you where you need to go
'Cause I'm a country boy
You sure look good sitting in my right seat
Buckle up and I'll take you through the five speeds
Wind it up or I can slow it way down
In the woods or right up town
I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
Yeah I can get you where you need to go
Big thirty-fives, whining on the asphalt
Grabbing mud and slinging up some red dirt
My mufflers loud, dual Thrush tubes
Crank the music and the tone gets real good
Let me know when we're getting close
You can slide on out or we can head on down the road
Yeah, I can get you where you want to go
Bucket seats, soft as babies nude butt
Locking hubs to take you through a deep rut
Up city streets, down winding roads
Yeah, I'm a country boy, I got a four-wheel drive
I can get you where you want to go
Yeah, I'm a country boy
Ah, I'm just a country boy
A nice little country boy

===== Alan Jackson - Don't Rock the Jukebox =====
Don't rock the jukebox
I wanna hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rocking
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song
Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heart-broke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Ever since she left
Before you punch that number
Could I make one request
I ain't got nothing
Against rock and roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
Ain't nothing like a steel guitar
To drown a memory
Before you spend your money baby
Play a song for me
I wanna hear George Jones
Yeah, don't rock the jukebox

===== Alan Jackson - Chasin' That Neon Rainbow =====
Daddy won a radio, he tuned it to a country show
I was rocking in the cradle to the crying of a steel guitar
Mama used to sing to me, she taught me that sweet harmony
Now she worries 'cause she never thought I'd ever really take it this far
Singing in the bars
And chasing that neon rainbow, living that honky-tonk dream
'Cause all I've ever wanted is to pick this guitar and sing
Just trying to be somebody, just wanna be heard and seen
I'm chasing that neon rainbow, living that honky-tonk dream
An atlas and a coffee cup, five pickers in an old Dodge truck
Heading down to Houston for a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killing me, half the time I sing for free
When the crowd's into it, lord, it makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Standing in the spotlight
And chasing that neon rainbow, I'm-a living that honky-tonk dream
Daddy's got a radio, he won it thirty years ago
He said, "Son, I just know we're going to hear you singing on it someday"
I made it up to Music Row, but lordy, don't the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldn't trade a minute and I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage
I'm chasing that neon rainbow, I'm-a living that honky-tonk dream
Oh, I'm chasing that neon rainbow, living that honky-tonk dream

===== Alan Jackson - Freight Train =====
I just came down from Chippewa
Had a station wagon and a hundred dollars
Thinking about the girl I'd lost a year before
I hadn't seen her for some time
Thought I might go on by
When your memory came flooding in and you closed that door
Wish I was a freight train, baby
Wish I was a diesel locomotive
I'd come whistling down your track
Crashing in your doorway
Wish I didn't have a heart
You need a shovel for the coal
Just to get me started
Wish I was a freight train
Well, every time I talk to you I hear your jealous lies
I feel like I've been left abandoned on some old railway side
And every time I hear your voice my water just gets cold
My stoker will not stoke and my boiler will not boil
Well, every time I fell behind I could not get ahead
I wish someone would pull the lever and give me a little sand
And every time I slip behind even further back
I wish some switch man would come out of the fog and change my track

===== Alan Jackson - Summertime Blues =====
Well I'm a-gonna raise a fuss, I'm gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer just to try an' earn a dollar
Every time I call my baby, to try to get a date
My boss says, "No dice, son, you gotta work late"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
'Cause there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Well my mom 'n' papa told me, "Son, you gotta make some money
If you wanna use the car to go ridin' next Sunday"
Well I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick
"Now you can't use the car cause you didn't work a lick"
I'm gonna take two weeks, gonna have a vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nation
Well I called my congressman and he said quote
"I'd like to help you son, but you're too young to vote"
Yeah, sometimes I wonder what I'm gonna do
No there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

===== Alan Jackson - Chattahoochee =====
Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little about love
Aw haw
Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willin' but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
I dropped her off early but I didn't go home
Never had a plan just a living for the minute
Yeah-eee
That's right

===== Alan Jackson - Tall, Tall Trees =====
If you want to drive a big limousine
I'll buy the longest one you've ever seen
I'll buy you tall, tall trees
And all the waters in the seas
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you
If you want to own a great big mansion
Well I'll give it my utmost attention
Well, I'm a fool, a fool for you
It may take awhile, but I'll prove it's true
Well, if it's loving you want, well I've got it
If it's money you want, then I'll get it
I'm a fool, fool, fool for you (Yahee) (Woo)
If you want to take a trip across the ocean
I'll travel anywhere you take a notion
Well, I'm a fool, oh for you
Well, if it's loving you want, then I've got it
Yeah I'm a fool, fool, fool, for you

===== Alan Jackson - Small Town Southern Man =====
Born the middle son of a farmer
And a small town Southern man
Like his daddy's daddy before him
Brought up working on the land
Fell in love with a small town woman
And they married up and settled down
Natural way of life if you're lucky
For a small town Southern man
First there came four pretty daughters
For this small town Southern man
Then a few years later came another
A boy, he wasn't planned
Seven people living all together
In a house built with his own hands
Little words with love and understanding
From a small town Southern man
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
Callous hands told the story
He gave it all to keep it all together
And keep his family on his land
Like his daddy, years wore out his body
Made it hard just to walk and stand
You can break the back
But you can't break the spirit
Finally, death came calling
He said it's alright 'cause I see angels
And they got me by the hand
Don't you cry, and don't you worry
I'm blessed, and I know I am
'Cause God has a place in Heaven

===== Alan Jackson - Where I Come From =====
Well, I was rollin' wheels and shiftin' gears 'round that Jersey Turnpike
When Barney stopped me with his gun ten minutes after midnight
Said, "Sir, you broke the limit, in this rusty old truck
I don't know about that accent, son, just where did you come from?"
I said, "Where I come from, it's cornbread and chicken"
Where I come from, a lot of front porch sittin'
Where I come from, tryin' to make a livin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven, where I come from
Well, I was south of Detroit City, I pulled in this country kitchen
To try their brand of barbecue, the sign said finger-lickin'
Well, I paid the tab, and the lady asked me how'd I like my biscuit
"I'll be honest with you ma'am, it ain't like mama fixed it"
'Cause where I come from, it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from, lot of front porch pickin'
I was chasin' sun on 101, somewhere around Ventura
And I lost a universal joint, and I had to use my finger
This tall lady stopped and asked if I had plans for dinner
Said, "No, thanks, ma'am, back home, we like the girls who'd sing soprano"
Well, I was headin' home on 65, somewhere around Kentucky
And the CB rang for the bobtail rig, it's rollin' on like thunder
Well, I answered him and he asked me, "Aren't you from out in Tulsa?"
"Nah, but you might've seen me there, I just dropped a load of salsa"
Where I come from, it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from, a lot of front porch pickin'
And workin' hard to get to heaven, where I come—
Where I come from, yeah, it's cornbread and chicken
Where I come from, a lot of back porch pickin'
Where I come from
Yeah, where I come from
A lot of front porch sittin'
And starin' up at heaven, where I come from
Trying to make a livin'
Oh, where I come from

===== Alan Jackson - It Must Be Love =====
First I get cold and hot
Think I'm on fire, but I'm not
Oh, what a pain I've got
It must be love
There's nothing I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm goin' through
I fall like a sparrow
And fly like a dove
You must be the dream I been dreamin' of
Oh what a feelin'
Something is wrong or right
I think of you all night
Can't sleep 'til morning light
Seeing you in my dreams
Holding you close to me
Oh, what else can it be?
You must be the dream
I been dreamin' of

===== Alan Jackson - Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning) =====
Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?
I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?
Did you open your eyes, and hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow?
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching?
And turn on "I Love Lucy" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers?
Stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

===== Alan Jackson - Designated Drinker =====
Here's my keys
I want you to take them
I think I'm going to need you, to get back home
Hold on to my hat, I don't want to lose it
I couldn't stand for something else to be gone
I'm sure you know the reason I'm here crying
I think you'll understand why
Tonight
I'm the designated drinker
I just lost
The one who wrapped me around her finger
I need to get
To where I can't think of her
So tonight
I came here to get you to help me
I need a friend to see me through
I hated to call, I knew you wouldn't mind at all
I know you know I'd do the same for you
I'm not the kind that likes to drown my sorrows
I may hate myself tomorrow
We need to get to where we can't think of her
We're the designated drinkers
Woah tonight

===== Kris Kristofferson - Me and Bobby McGee =====
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time and
Bobby clappin' hands we finally sang up every song
That driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.
From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me, Lord, through everythin' I done
Every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Nothin' left is all she left for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

===== Kris Kristofferson - Help Me Make It Through the Night =====
Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Lay it soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care who’s right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
I don't care what's right or wrong (Yes, I do!)
Lord, it's bad to be alone

===== Kris Kristofferson - Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down =====
Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet for my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
I'd smoked my brain the night before
On cigarettes and songs that I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at  a can that he was kickin'
Then I crossed the empty street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somehow, somewhere along the way
On the Sunday morning sidewalks
Wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalks
Sunday mornin' comin' down
In the park, I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the song that they were singin'
Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyons
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday
Makes a body feel alone
On the sleepin' city sidewalk
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do

===== Kris Kristofferson - Why Me =====
Why me, Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one of the pleasures I've known?
Tell me, Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth lovin' you or the kindness you've shown?
Lord help me, Jesus, I've wasted it
So help me, Jesus, I know what I am
But now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me, Jesus, my soul's in your hand
Try me, Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay all I've taken from you
Maybe, Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself on my way back to you
Jesus, my soul's in your hand

===== Kris Kristofferson - Sunday Morning Coming Down =====
Well, I woke up Sunday morning with
No way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my
Closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the
Stairs to meet the day
I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playing with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell
Of someone's frying chicken
And, Lord
It took me back to something
That I'd lost somewhere
Somehow along the way
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down
In the park, I saw a daddy with
A laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school and
Listened to the songs they were singing
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyons like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

===== Kris Kristofferson - Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again) =====
I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I've been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love, and time we had to spend
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together with a feeling that I've never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman nor afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
And loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Mmm, mmm
Ah

===== Kris Kristofferson - Casey's Last Ride =====
Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dyin'
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains
"Oh," she said, "Casey it's been so long since I've seen you"
"Here," she said, "just a kiss to make a body smile"
"See," she said, "I've put on new stockings just to please you"
"Lord," she said, "Casey can you only stay a while?"
Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for anything they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner, Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
"Oh," she said, "I suppose you seldom think about me"
"Now," she said, "Now that you've a family of your own"
"Still," she said, "it's so blessed good to feel your body"
"Lord," she said, "Casey, it's a shame to be alone"

===== Kris Kristofferson - The Taker =====
{Intro}
He's a giver, he'll give her
The kind of attention that she's never known
He's a teacher, he'll teacher her
To open the doors that she can't on her own
He's a lover, he'll love her
In ways that she never has been loved before
And he's a getter, he'll get her
By gettin' her into the world she's been hungryin' for
He's a charmer, and he'll charm her
With money and manners that I never learned
He's a leader, and he'll lead her
Across pretty bridges he's planning to burn
He's a talker, he'll talk her
Right off of her feet, but he won't talk for long
Cause he's a doer, and he'll do her
The way that I've never
And damned if he won't do her wrong
Cause he's a taker, he'll take her
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow
And after he's taken the body and soul
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted
Then he'll take off and leave her
Takin' all of her pride as he goes
{Outro}

===== Kris Kristofferson - From the Bottle to the Bottom =====
You ask me if I'm happy now
That's good as any joke I've heard
It seems since I've seen you last
I done forgot the meanin' of the words
If happiness is empty rooms
And drinkin' in the afternoon
Well I suppose I'm happy as a clown
But if it's got a thing to do
With smilin' of forgettin' you
Well I don't guess that I could say I am
Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone
Without a blanket on to keep him from the dew
When the water from the weeds it soaked the papers
He been puttin' in his shoes to keep the ground from coming through
And his future feels as empty as the pockets in his pants
Because he's never seen a single dream come true
That's the way that I've been feeling since the day I started falling
From the bottle to the bottom stool by stool
Learning hard to live with losin' you
You wonder if I'm better off
With freedom now to do the things I choose
With all my times my own and
I got nothing left but sleeping time to lose
There's no one here to carry on
If I stay out the whole night long
Or give a tankerous damn if I don't call
I'm living like I wanted to
And doing things I wanna do
And nothing means a thing to me at all

===== Kris Kristofferson - Loving Arms =====
If you could see me now
The one who said that he'd rather roam
The one who said he'd rather be alone
If you could only see me now
If I could hold you now
Just for a moment, if I could make you mine
Just for a while, turn back the hands of time
If I could only hold you now
I've been too long in the wind, too long in the rain
Takin' any comfort that I can
Lookin' back and longin' for the freedom of my chains
Lyin' in your lovin' arms again
If you could hear me now
Singin' somewhere through a lonely night
Dreamin' of the arms that held me tight
If you could only hear me now

===== Kris Kristofferson - The Pilgrim, Chapter 33 =====
I started writing a song about Chris Gentry and ended up writing about Dennis Hopper,  Johnny Cash... Norman, Norbert, Funky Donnie Fritts, Billy Swan, Bobby Neuwirth, Jerry Jeff Walker,  Paul Siebel…and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott had a lot to do with it
See him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans
Wearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smile
Once he had a future full of money, love, and dreams
Which he spent like they was goin' outta style
And he keeps right on a-changin' for the better or the worse
Searchin' for a shrine, he's never found
Never knowin' if believin' is a blessin' or a curse
Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down
He's a poet and he's a picker, he's a prophet and he's a pusher
He's a pilgrim and a preacher and a problem when he's stoned
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction
Takin' every wrong direction on his lonely way back home
He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars
And he's traded in tomorrow for today
Runnin' from his devils, Lord, and reachin' for the stars
And losin' all he's loved along the way
But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse
And all he ever gets is older and around
From the rockin' of the cradle to the rollin' of the hearse
The goin' up was worth the comin' down
There's a lot o' wrong directions on that lonely way back home

===== Kris Kristofferson - The Silver Tongued Devil and I =====
I took myself down to the Tally Ho Tavern
To buy me a bottle of beer
And I sat me down by a tender young maiden
Who's eyes were as dark as her hair
And as I was searching from bottle to bottle
For something un-foolish to say
That silver tongued devil just slipped from the shadows
And smilingly stole her away
I said: "Hey, little girl, don't you know he's the devil
He's everything that I ain't
Hiding intentions of evil
Under the smile of a saint
All he's good for is getting in trouble
And shiftin' his share of the blame
And some people swear he's my double:
And some even say we're the same"
But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose
I'll only live 'til I die
We take our own chances and pay our own dues
The silver tongued devil and I
Like all the fair maidens who've laid down beside him
She knew in her heart that he'd lied
Nothin' that I could have said could have saved her
No matter how hard that she tried
'Cos she'll offer her charms to the darkness and danger
Of somethin' that she's never known
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger
Who'll love her and leave her alone
And you know, he's the devil
And some even say we're the same
Ah ha ha ha

===== Kris Kristofferson - I'd Rather Be Sorry =====
If you hurt me, you won't be the first or the last
In a lifetime of many mistakes
But I won't spend tomorrow regretting the past
For the chances that I didn't take
'Cause I'll never know 'til it's over
If I'm right or I'm wrong loving you
But I'd rather be sorry for something I've done
Than for something that I didn't do
When you touch me, it's easy to make me believe
Tomorrow won't take you away
But I'd gamble whatever tomorrow might bring
For the love that I'm living today
And I'll never know 'til it's over
Yes, I'd rather be sorry for something I've done

===== Kris Kristofferson - Jody and the Kid =====
She would meet me in the mornin', on my way down to the river
Waitin' patient by the Chinaberry tree
With her feet already dusty, from the pathway to the levee
And her little blue jeans rolled up to her knees
I'd pay her no attention, as she tagged along beside me
Tryin' hard to copy everything I did
But I couldn't keep from smilin' when I'd hear somebody sayin'
Looky yonder there goes Jody and the kid
Even after we grew older, we could still be seen together
As we walked along the levee holdin' hands
For as surely as the seasons, she was changin' to a woman
And I'd lived enough to call myself a man
And she often lay beside me, in the coolness of the evenin'
'Til the mornin' sun was shinin' on my bed
And at times when she was sleepin', I would smile when I'd remember
How they use to call us Jody and the kid
Now the world's a little older, and the years have changed the river
'Cause there's houses where they didn't used to be
And on Sundays, I go walkin' down the pathway to the levee
With another little girl who follows me
And it makes the old folks smile, to see her tag along beside me
Doin' little things the way her mama did
But it gets a little lonesome when I hear somebody sayin'
Looky yonder, there goes Jody and the kid

===== Kris Kristofferson - Come Sundown =====
I heard the front door closing softly
As I wakened from my sleep;
With the soft touch of her lips, Lord
Like a whisper on my cheek;
And I cursed the sun for risin'
'cause the worst, Lord, was yet to come;
'Cause this morning, she's just leavin'
But, come sundown, she'll be gone
See the lipstick on the pillow
That I placed beneath her head;
And the soft sheets still feel warm, Lord
Where she lay upon my bed;
And it hurts to know it's over
For the hurt, Lord, has just begun

===== Kris Kristofferson - Nobody Wins =====
Any more it doesn't matter who's right or wrong
We've been injuring each other for much too long
And it's too late to try to save what might have been
It's over, nobody wins
Make believing in forever is just a lie
And it seems a little sadder each time we try
'Cause it's a shame to make the same mistakes again and again
We've gone too far, too long, too far apart
The lovin' was easy, it's the livin' that's hard
And there's no need to stay and see the way it ends

===== Kris Kristofferson - Casey's Last Ride =====
Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dyin'
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains
"Oh," she said, "Casey it's been so long since I've seen you"
"Here," she said, "just a kiss to make a body smile"
"See," she said, "I've put on new stockings just to please you"
"Lord," she said, "Casey can you only stay a while?"
Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for anything they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner, Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye
"Oh," she said, "I suppose you seldom think about me"
"Now," she said, "Now that you've a family of your own"
"Still," she said, "it's so blessed good to feel your body"
"Lord," she said, "Casey, it's a shame to be alone"

===== Kris Kristofferson - When I Loved Her =====
Well, she didn't look as pretty as some others I have known
And she wasn't good at conversation when we were alone
But she had a way of makin' me believe that I belonged
And it felt like comin' home, when I found her
'Cause she seemed to be so proud of me just walkin' holdin' hands
And she didn't think that money was the measure of a man
And we seemed to fit together when I held her in my arms
And it left me feelin' warm, when I loved her
'Cause she brightened up the day like the early mornin' sun
And she made what I was doin' seem worthwhile
It's the closest thing to livin' that I guess I've ever known
And it made me want to smile, when I loved her
I know some of us were born to cast our fortune to the winds
And I guess I'm bound to travel down a road that never ends
But I know I'll never look upon the likes of her again
And I'll never understand, why I lost her

===== Kris Kristofferson - Help Me Make It Through the Night =====
Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Lay it soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care who’s right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord, tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
I don't care what's right or wrong (Yes, I do!)
Lord, it's bad to be alone

===== Kris Kristofferson - Hellacious Acres =====
Look who's advertising
Billboards everywhere
See hellacious acres
Your tailor-made nightmare
Traffic is backed up for miles
Attendants welcome you with devilish smiles
Steady, steady
Have your tickets ready
Go to hell after dark
It's a sin-filled city, an amusement park
It's a one-way ticket to the other side
It's a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde
And see Lizzie Borden, she's one of the stars
And tricky Dickie barkin', flashin' you his pardon
Oh, Jack The Ripper slashin' your tires
Oh, even the Devil needs money
Even the President need money
To cover his overhead
That's why he opened hellacious acres
Or so his press agent said
Hang out with heavies, your partners in crime
Forget the consequences, have a good time
It's a Dr. Jekyll, it's a Mr. Hyde
And get down and study, suspicion and doubt
At hellacious acres, listen, mischief makers
Admission's free, you pay to get out
Uh-huh-huh

===== Flatt & Scruggs - Hear the Wind Blow =====
Down in the valley the valley so low hang your head over hear the wind blow
Hear the blow hear the wind blow hang your head over hear the wind blow
Roses love sunshine violets love dew angels in heaven know I love you
If you don't love me love who you please put your arms round me give my heart ease
Give my heart ease love give my heart ease
Put your arms round me give my heart ease
Write me a letter send it by mail send it in care of the Birmingham jail
Birmingham jail love Brimingham jail send it in care of the Birmingham jail
Build me a castle forty feet high so I can see her as she rides by
As she rides by love as she rides by so I can see her as she rides by

===== Flatt & Scruggs - Roll In My Sweet Baby’s Arms =====
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
Lay around the shack 'til the mail train comes back
And roll in my sweet baby's arms
I ain't gonna work on the railroad
I ain't gonna work on the farm
Now where was you last Friday night
While I was lyin' in jail?
Walkin' the streets with another man
Wouldn't even go my bail
I know your parents don't like me
They drove me away from your door
Had my life to live over
I'd never go there anymore

===== Flatt & Scruggs - Before I Met You =====
I thought I'd seen pretty girls in my time
That was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
I thought I was swinging the world by its tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
I wanted to ramble and always be free
I never saw one that could ever hold me
They say a man must reap what he's sown
Darlin', I hope that's not true
For once I made plans of living alone
But that was before I met you

===== Flatt & Scruggs - The Ballad of Jed Clampett =====
Come and listen to a story about a man named Jed
A poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed
Then one day he was shootin' at some food
And up through the ground come a bubblin' crude
(Oil, that is. Black gold, Texas tea)
Well the first thing you know, Jed's a millionaire
Kinfolk said Jed move away from there
Said California is the place you oughta' be
So they loaded up the truck and they moved to Beverly
(Hills, that is. Swimmin' pools, movie stars)
Now its time to say good-bye to Jed and all his kin
They would like to thank you folks fer' kindly droppin' in
You're all invited back next week to this locality
To have a heapin' helpin' of their hospitality
Hillbillies
That's what they call them now
Nice folks, y'all come back here

===== Flatt & Scruggs - Sun’s Gonna Shine in My Backdoor Someday =====
Sun's gonna shine in my backdoor someday
March wind's gonna blow my blues all away
My mama told me long years ago
Never to marry no boy I know
He won't give you money no decent clothes
What will become of you God only knows
Hard times're comin' I've been told
Never sell love for a rich man's gold
Hard times're comin' that much I know
Love won't help you when you're hungry and cold

===== Flatt & Scruggs - Blue Ridge Cabin Home =====
There's a well beaten path in the old mountainside
Where I wandered when I was a lad
And I wandered alone to the place I call home
In those Blue Ridge hills far away
Oh I love those hills of old Virginia
From those Blue Ridge hills I did roam
When I die won't you bury me on the mountain
Far away near my Blue Ridge mountain home
Now my thoughts wander back to that ramshackle shack
In those blue ridge hills far away
Where my mother and dad were laid there to rest
They are sleeping in peace together there
I return to that old cabin home with a sigh
I've been longing for days gone by
When I die, won't you bury me on that old mountain side
Make my resting place upon the hills so high

===== Flatt & Scruggs - Get in Line Brother =====
Oh, listen to me, sinners, don't you want to go
For some day He's comin' back again you know
If that wrong ain't righted you'll be lost in sin
Get in line, brother, He will take you in
Get in line brother if you wanna go home
Get on your knees and righten that wrong
Then you'll be singing this old time song
Get in line, brother, if you wanna go home
Oh, listen to me, Satan, I have righted that wrong
Got a one way ticket and I'm goin' home
I've got no worries as I sing this song
If I could tell you, brother, just how I feel
Then I'm sure you'll know the love of God is real
Then you'll be praying while I sing this song

===== Flatt & Scruggs - You Are My Flower =====
You are my flower
That's blooming in the mountain so high
That's blooming there for me
When summertime is gone and snow begins to fall
You can sing this song and say to one and all
So wear that smile and life will be worthwhile
Forget the tears and don't forget to smile

===== Flatt & Scruggs - He Took Your Place =====
Upon the rugged cross of Calvary
Was there my blessed Savior cried
Forgive them for they know not what they do
Oh, sinner friend, for thee he died
His hands are gently knocking on your door
Outside he's pleading to come in
His heart is breaking as he waits for you
To wash you free from every sin
Someday he's coming back to claim his own
We'll fly to Heaven's golden shore
A crown of life he gives on that glad day
With him we'll live forever more
Those cruel thorns they pierced my Savior's head
The blood was flowing down his face
In shame, forsaken there he hung and died
Oh, sinner friend, he took you place

===== Flatt & Scruggs - You Can Feel It in Your Soul =====
When you go to church on Sunday and leave your Saviour out
You feel like you're alone when you all begin to shout
When you get that old time religion you want the world to know
(But you won't have ask nobody) you can feel it in your soul
You can feel it in your soul that you want the world to know
Some people ask the neighbors about the ways of sin
And what they have to do for Christ to live within
But let me tell you brother one thing you should know
(And you won't have ask nobody) you can feel it in your soul
You can feel it in your soul...
If you haven't got time religion and don't know what to do
You better take up the Bible and lead the pages through
It tell you any word of things you want to know
(And you won't have ask your neighbors) you can feel it in your soul

===== Flatt & Scruggs - Old Salty Dog Blues =====
Standin' on the corner with the lowdown blues
A great big hole in the bottom of my shoes
Honey let me be your salty dog
Let me be your salty dog but I won't be your man at all
Looky here Sal well I know you rundown stockin' and a worn out shoe
Honey let me be your Salty Dog
Let me be your salty dog...
Down in the wildwood sittin' on a log finger on the trigger and eye on the hog
Pulled the trigger and they said go shot fell over in Mexico
Honey let me be you Salty Dog

===== Flatt & Scruggs - The Legend of the Johnson Boys =====
Have you heard the many a story told by old and young with joy
Bout the many deeds a daring that was done by the Johnson boys
That was done by the Johnson boys
That was done by the Johnson boys that was done by the Johnson boys
( fiddle + banjo )
The Johnson boys were boys of honor they knew how the fortune made
They knew how to hug and kiss them oh but pretty girls don't be afraid
Oh but pretty girls don't be afraid oh but pretty girls don't be afraid
They were lads of skill and courage and their sights were very far
And they joined the country service in that awful Civil War
In that awful Civil War in that awful Civil War
They were scouts in Rebels army and were known far and wide
When the Yankees saw them comin' they throw down their guns and hide
They throw down their guns and hide they throw down their guns and hide

===== Flatt & Scruggs - Over the Hills to the Poorhouse =====
Oh how can it be they have driven
Their father so helpless and old
Oh God may their crimes be forgiven
To perish out here in the cold
I'm old I'm helpless and feeble
And the days of my youth have gone by
And it's over the hill to the poor house
I must wander alone there to die
Long years since Mary was taken
My faithful affectionate wife
Since then I've been alone and forsaken
The light has died out of my life
I gave them the house they were born in
A deed to the farm and more
I gave them the place that they lived on
And now I am turned from it's door
Oh me on the doorstep up yonder
I've set with my babe's on my knee
No father so happy or fonder
Than I of my little ones three

===== Flatt & Scruggs - The Martha White Theme =====
Now you bake right (uh-huh) with Martha White (yes, ma'am)
Goodness gracious, good and light, Martha White
For the finest biscuits, cakes and pies
Get Martha White self-rising flour
The one all purpose flour
Martha White self-rising flour's
Got Hot Rise
For the finest cornbread you can bake
Get Martha White self-rising meal
The one all purpose meal
Martha White self-rising meal
For goodness' sake

===== Flatt & Scruggs - 99 Years Is Almost for Life =====
The courtroom was crowded the judge waited there
My mother was crying when I left my chair
The sentence were sharpful they cut like a knife
For ninety ninety years folks is almost for life
I dreamed of the whistle I heard the bells ring
My sweetheart was coming some good news to bring
I knew that she loved me and that she'd be true
She said she would save me I'm guilty as you
She went for a pardon or else for parole
I know she'll come back for she's part of my soul
If she ever fails me I'd be mighty blue I'll stay in this jailhouse I'll die in here too
They said I was a criminal and to my despair
They sent me to Nashville and shaved off my hair
So come hear my story I'll tell you my fate
I'm serving in Nashville for another man's hate
I just got a letter from Nashville town and after I read it my spirit broke down
It's sad that my sweetheart and the judge would be wed
And here in this jailhouse I wish I was dead
No matter how right folks a man he may be
Bad company will sent him to prison like me
So take a good woman and make her your wife

===== Flatt & Scruggs - Father’s Table Grace =====
While we sit at the table, our family's heads bowed low
My thoughts return to childhood, and the finest man I know
He doesn't speak good English, he's just a simple man
But when he's talking to the Lord, even a little child can understand
I was young and reckless, but the thought still comes to me
When I told my dad I felt I was old enough to leave
He sat there at the table, and I looked him on his face
He never spoke another word till he said the table grace
He said, Our gracious Heavenly Father, we're all gathered here today
To give Thee thanks for blessings, so humbly we pray
My oldest son is leavin', I'm sure he knows what's best
But just in case, would you stand by, and help him stand the test?
Lord, he's awful neglectful about church on Sunday morn
And if he gets with the wrong crowd, would You let him hold Your arm?
And if he flies too high, would You clip his wings?
But don't let him fall too hard, I'm sure, Lord, You can handle things
I've tried my best from day to day to teach him right from wrong
And he's grown to be a fine young man, and he's always blessed our home
We pray Thee, Lord, for guidance that he won't build upon the sand
But we won't worry half as much, if we know he's in Your hands
And, oh yes, Lord, it won't be long till I'll be comin' home
Don't make me wait too long
We pray Thee, Lord, for guidance, please cleanse us from our sins
So we all be together in Heaven, in Jesus' name, Amen
The table was silent as tears ran down my face
And from that day on, I based my life on father's table grace

===== Flatt & Scruggs - Polka on a Banjo =====
Polka on a Banjo
Flatt and Scruggs
There's a sweet young Miss, I love to kiss, but listen close and hear me
She's not my only love, I have another love, and she'll just have to share me
But she?s five foot tall, high heel and all, she already knows
She had some competition, in a composition, known as polka on an old banjo
Chorus
Polka on a banjo, make that five string hot
Polka on a banjo, give it all you've got
Polka on a banjo, watch them fingers go
Of all the songs I guess, the one that I love best
Is the polka on an old banjo
(Banjo Solo)
And when they start the band, she takes me by the hand, and I begin to swing her
She knows I never miss, a chance to steal a kiss, or dance the polka with her
I don't speak a word ,once I have heard, the one thing I love so
She's caught in the middle, she played the second fiddle, to a polka on an old banjo
Chorus - End

===== Flatt & Scruggs - Your Love Is Like a Flower =====
It was long, long ago in the moonlight
We were sitting on the banks of the stream
When you whispered so sweetly, I love you
As the waters murmured a tune
Oh they tell me your love is like a flower
In the springtime blossoms so fair
In the fall then they wither away dear
And they tell me that's the way of your love
I remember the night, little darling
We were talking of days gone by
When you told me you always would love me
That for me your love would never die
It was spring when you whispered these words dear
The flowers were all blooming so fair
But today as the snow falls around us
I can see that your love is not there

===== Flatt & Scruggs - I’m Working on a Road (To Glory Land) =====
Each day I get so lonely while living here below
My Saviours waiting patiently, I'm planning soon to go
I'm on a firm foundation thats built with Gods own hand
So now I started building a road to Gloryland
Chorus
I'm workin' on a road that leads to Glory
I want to hold my Saviours hand
I'm building my hope on things eternal
I'm workin' on a road to Gloryland
Oh listen to me sinner when your time comes to go
You know we have a promise while living here below
You know he suffered for our sins and died upon the cross
For all who will believe on Him
Their soul will not be lost

===== Charley Pride - Kiss An Angel Good Mornin’ =====
Whenever I chance to meet
Some old friends on the street
They wonder, "How does a man get to be this way?"
I've always got a smiling face
Anytime and any place
And every time they ask me why
I just smile and say
"You've got to
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
And love her like the devil when you get back home"
Well, people may try to guess
The secret of a happiness
But some of them never learn, it's a simple thing
The secret I'm speakin' of
Is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in this song
That I always sing
You've got to
And love her like the devil when you get back home

===== Charley Pride - All I Have to Offer You (Is Me) =====
Before you take another step, there's something you should know
About the years ahead and how they'll be
You'll be living in a world where roses hardly ever grow
'Cause all I have to offer you is me
There'll be no mansion waiting on the hill with crystal chandeliers
And there'll be no fancy clothes for you to wear
Everything I have is standing here in front of you to see
All I have to offer you is me
Sweetheart I'll give you all my love in every way I can
But make sure that's what you want while you're still free
The only gold I have for you is in this wedding band

===== Charley Pride - (I’m So) Afraid of Losing You Again =====
Sometimes I want to throw my arms around you
Then I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it cost to love you
And I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you again
If heaven were to hear my heart's confession
Wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
'Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again

===== Charley Pride - Time Out For Jesus =====
Take time out for Jesus, He took time for you
Take a little time in the mornin'
And you'll feel better all day
Take a little time for Jesus
To get down on your knees and pray
He took the time to die on the cross
So all of our souls wouldn't be lost
If you find yourself slippin', then the thing to do
Sometimes you may be in a hurry
You have so many things to do
But don't forget about Jesus
Remember, He didn't forget you
If you find yourself slippin', the the thing to do

===== Charley Pride - Lord, Build Me A Cabin In Glory =====
Many years I've been looking for a place to call home
But I've failed here to find it, so I must travel on;
I don't care for fine mansions on earth's sinking sand
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of glory land
Lord build me just a cabin in the corner of Gloryland
In the shade of his tree of life that it may ever stand
Where I can hear the angels and shake Jesus' hand
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of Gloryland
Listen Lord I'm not askin' to live in the midst
For I know that I'm not worthy of such splendor as this
When I ask him for mercy while humbly I stand
Yes build me just a cabin in the corner of Gloryland
I've many dear loved one's who've gone on this way
On the grapevine of mournin' shall I hear them all say
Come and join in our singin' and play in our band
Lord build me a cabin in the corner of gloryland

===== Charley Pride - Crystal Chandelier =====
Oh the crystal chandeliers light up the paintings on your wall
The marble statuettes are standing stately in the hall
But will the timely crowd that has you laughing loud help you dry your tears
When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers?
I never did fit in too well with the folks you knew
And it's plain to see that the likes of me don't fit with you
So you traded me for the gaiety of the well to do
And you turned away from the love I offered you
I see your picture in the news most every day
You're the chosen girl of the social world so the stories say
But a paper smile only lasts a while then it fades away
And the love we knew will come home to you some day
When the new wears off of your crystal chandeliers

===== Charley Pride - The Snakes Crawl at Night =====
Oh the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say
When the sun goes down, then the snakes will play
I watched that car pull right up into my driveway
Saw a shadow slip away from my house
So I hurried straight and looked in her room
And I found out that it was my loving spouse
Oh, the snakes crawl at night, that's what they say
So I waited in the shadows until morning
And the gun I held was trembling in my hand
No, I did not plan to give them any warning
Cause the devil on my shoulder had command
Oh the trial in a little while was over
And they sentenced me to die right away
But before I leave this courtroom please, Your Honor
There's something more that I would like to say

===== Charley Pride - I’m Just Me =====
Down at the railroad station there's people gettin' on
Some are a goin' north some are a goin' south I'm just goin' to be gone
Some people are born to be takers others just wanna give
Some people live just to love but I just love to live
For I was just born to be exactly what you see
Nothing more or less I'm not the worst or the best
I just try to be exactly what you see today and every day I'm just me
When people say their life is rough I wonder compared to what
Some are wantin' more and more's gettin' less I just want what I've got
Some wanna live on a hill others down by the sea
Some wanna live inside high walls I just wanna live free
For I was just born...
Oh I was just born to be exactly what you see today and every day I'm just me

===== Charley Pride - I Don’t Know Why I Love You But I Do =====
I don't know why I love you but I do
I don't know why I cry so but I do
I only know I'm lonely and that I want you only
I can't sleep nights because I feel so restless
I don't know what to do, I feel so helpless
And since you've went away, I cry both night and day
My days have been so lonely
My nights have been so blue
I don't know how I spend it, but I do
Each night I sit alone and tell myself
That I will fall in love with someone else
I guess I'm wasting time but I've got to clear my mind
I don't know why I love you
I do

===== Charley Pride - Is Anybody Goin’ to San Antone =====
Rain drippin' off the brim of my hat
Sure is cold today
Here I am walking down 66
Wish she hadn't done me that way
Sleeping under a table in a roadside park
A man could wake up dead
But it sure seems warmer than it did
Sleepin' in our king-size bed
Is anybody goin to San Antone
Or Phoenix, Arizona?
Any place is alright as long as I
Can forget I've ever known her
Wind whippin' down the neck of my shirt
Like I ain't got nothin' on
But I'd rather fight the wind and rain
Than what I've been fightin' at home
Yonder comes a truck with the US mail
People writin' letters back home
Tomorrow she'll probably want me back
But I'll still be just as gone

===== Charley Pride - You’re Still the Only One I’ll Ever Love =====
Time has passed and things have changed
You've gone your way I've gone mine
On the surface it's all over but beneath the surface
You're still on my mind
'Cause you're still the only one I'll ever love
Forget the hours, forget the miles
Your lips are still the lips I'm dreaming of
And you're still the only one I'll ever love
--- Instrumental ---
All my thoughts of you are good ones
Happy hours that just flew by
You were always someone special
And you'll be my someone special till I die
Treasured mem'ry of treasured time
Yes you're still the only one I'll ever love

===== Charley Pride - I Don’t Deserve A Mansion =====
I was lost but Jesus saved me
He gave his life on Calvary's tree
And though I failed him
He still loves me
Through his grace I've been set free
I know I don't deserve a mansion
'Cause I was born a sinful man
No, I don't deserve a mansion
But Jesus built a home for me in glory land
It was our sin that he died for
For all mankind he paid the price
Who are we that he should love us
Enough to give his life

===== Charley Pride - Someone Loves You Honey =====
I wanna share your life
Every minute, every day and night
And I just want you to know
That whatever you do, and wherever you go
Remember someone loves you, honey
No matter what
Just be my girl
Someone loves you, honey
More than anything in the world
I'm so glad that I'm the one
That you come to when you need someone
That's what my love is for
It's a shoulder to lean on a port in the storm
I just want you to be my girl

===== Charley Pride - Just Between You And Me =====
So I feel so blue sometimes I wanna die
And so I've got a broken heart so what
They say that time will heal all wounds in mice and men
And I know that someday I'll forget and love again
But just between you and me I've got my doubts about it
'Cause just between you and me you're too much to forget
So I lost the only girl I ever loved
And so I've never felt so low so what
I'll just tell myself each time I wanna cry
That someday time will dry the teardrops from my eyes
But just between you and me, I'm not so sure about it
'Cause just between you and me, you're too much to forget
You're too much to forget

===== Charley Pride - The Most Beautiful Girl in the World =====
Hey, did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did was she crying, cryin?
Hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl, that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her, that I love her
I woke up this morning, and realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
And I knew I'd lost my morning sun
I lost my head and I said some things
Now come the heartaches that the morning brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me
Did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world?

===== Charley Pride - Standing in My Way =====
I'm always there forever, I am
There between what I'm reaching for and the fingers on my hand
Blocking myself with things like words I shouldn't say
It seems I'm always standing in my way
Like the time I told you a lie
And I became the wall that stood between your heart and mine
I apologize but the truth is the truth don't ever fade
My way is the hard way, I guess
Guys like me say no when we mean yes
I'd step aside if I could 'cause I live for your embrace
But it seems I'm always standing in my way
Why you stand beside me, I don't know
There's so many places a girl like you could go
I hope you see enough in me to make you wanna stay
'Cause it seems I'm always standing in my way

===== Charley Pride - Be Grateful =====
Blind man can't see flowers growing in the garden
Crippled man can't walk places where he wants to go
Man that can't talk things he will never say
And a man that can't hear words he will never know
So if you can see and if you can walk
If you can hear and if you can talk
Then be grateful be grateful for what you've got
Cause for some folks these things would mean a lot
I once heard a man say all he wanted out of life was money
To be the richest man have wealth and fame untold
But he could see he could walk he could hear and he could talk
And for some folks this would mean much more than gold

===== Charley Pride - Kaw-Liga =====
Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian standin' by the door
He fell in love with an Indian maid over in the antique store
Kaw-Liga, yo-ho (Baw)
Just stood there, sayin' he never let it show
Oh, he could never answer yes or no, no, n-no
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red?
Kaw-Liga's got a poor ol' wooden head
He always wore his Sunday feathers and he held a tomahawk
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Just stood there, sayin' he never showed a sign
Because his heart was made of knotty pine, pine
And then one day, a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
He took her oh so far away but ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Just stood there and never let it show

===== Charley Pride - Just for the Love of It =====
I remember walking with my daddy through his weathered fields of grain
But he wouldn't curse the sun or give up on the rain
I ask him why don't you sell this place
Move to town you'll have money to burn
He said son you don't understand I don't do this for what I earn
Oh it's just for the love of it that's all the reason you need
What more could anyone ask  satisfaction  guaranteed
Don't chase rainbows or your pot of gold you'll always have enough
If you'll do everything you do  just for the love
Drove on back to Nashville thinking
That my daddy's words couldn't be true
How could a man keep pouring out his heart just to get it broke into
Then I looked around my two bare rooms and realized he wasn't wrong
And picked up this old guitar and poured out another song
The next summer I walked with my daddy
Through his golden fields of grain
Giving thanks to heaven above for the sunshine and the rain
Just leave it in the good Lords hands He always will provide
And you'll know what His reason is you don't even have ask Him why
He'll say just for the love of it that's all the reason you need
If you'll do everything you do  just for the love=

===== Charley Pride - Jesus, Don’t Give Up On Me =====
Jesus, I know I neglected to do
The little things, the big things you wanted me to
I've let you down, Jesus, that's not hard to see
Jesus, oh Jesus, don't give up on me
Stand by me, Jesus, forgive me somehow
If there's any hope left, don't leave me now
I might be worth savin', I'm trying to be
It's late, I know, and I made you wait
But don't turn the light out, don't lock the gate
Forgiveness and patience, that's all I need
Ah, Jesus, oh Jesus, don't give up on me

===== Randy Travis - Forever and Ever, Amen =====
You may think that I'm talking foolish
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you, always will be
But you're not just time that I'm killing
I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live, this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die, oh, baby
I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, Amen​
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, Amen
They say that time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girl's brown hair turn grey
But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway
They say that time can play tricks on a memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you, oh, darling
Well, just listen to how this song ends
Forever and ever, forever and ever

===== Randy Travis - Deeper Than the Holler =====
Well I've heard those city singers singin' 'bout how they can love,
Deeper than the oceans, higher than the stars above.
Well, I come from the country, and I know I ain't seen it all
But I heard that ocean's salty, and the stars, they sometimes fall.
And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you
So I had to sing this song about all the things I knew
My love is deeper than the holler.
Stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes,
That fall in late December
And honest as a Robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill.
From the back roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles between
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And every one is different, and every one's the same
And this is just another way of sayin' the same thing
My love is deeper than the holler
My love is purer than the snowflakes
And honest as a Robin on a spring-time window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill
A Whippoorwill

===== Randy Travis - Three Wooden Crosses =====
A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher
Riding on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education
And two of them were searching for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
And eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime
There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go
That farmer left a harvest, a home, and eighty acres
The faith and love for growing things in his young son's heart
And that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children
And did her best to give 'em all a better start
And that preacher whispered, "Can't you see the Promised Land?"
As he laid his blood-stained Bible in that hooker's hand
That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that blood-stained Bible up for all of us to see
He said, "Bless the farmer, and the teacher, and the preacher
Who gave this Bible to my mama, who read it to me"
Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know
It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you

===== Randy Travis - Diggin' Up Bones =====
Last night, I dug your picture out from my old dresser drawer
I set it on the table and I talked to it 'til four
I read some old love letters right up 'til the break of dawn
Yeah, I've been sittin' alone, diggin' up bones
Then I went through the jewelry and I found our wedding rings
I put mine on my finger and I gave yours a fling
Across this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home
Yeah, tonight, I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones
I'm diggin' up bones (Diggin' up bones)
Exhumin' things that's better left alone
I'm resurrectin' memories of a love that's dead and gone
And I went through the closet and I found some things in there
Like that pretty negligee that I bought you to wear
And I recall how good you looked each time you had it on
Yeah, tonight, I'm sittin' alone, diggin' up bones (Diggin' up bones)

===== Randy Travis - If I Didn't Have You =====
Well, I lost my heart on the day we met
But I gained a lot and that I don't regret
Then I hung around 'til you said I do
I knew I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
Well, it changed my thinkin' when you changed your name
And neither one of us will ever be the same
And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue
'Cause I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
If I didn't have you, I'd long ago
Been left in the dark, out in the cold
Blowin' around from town to town
Like a feather in the wind
If I didn't have you, I know I'd be
Flounderin' around like a ship at sea
Lost in the rain of a hurricane
And that's where I'd have been
But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light
Shinin' like a beacon on a cold dark night
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No, I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
Well, I count my blessings every night I pray
That the Lord lets me keep you just one more day
And every day He does, 'cause God knows too
That I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you
Been left in the dark out in the cold
Shinin' like a beacon on cold dark night
Then the sun came up and the skies turned blue
No, I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
Well, I've already said it, but I swear it's true
I know I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you

===== Randy Travis - I Told You So =====
Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spendin' all my time alone
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too and would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say
I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
But now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand?
Would we get that old-time feelin'? Would we laugh and talk for hours?
The way we did when our love first began
Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live and love forever, and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned?
Would you say I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawlin' back and asking me to take you in
And now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

===== Randy Travis - On the Other Hand =====
On one hand, I count the reasons I could stay with you
And hold you close to me all night long
So many lover's games, I'd love to play with you
On that hand, there's no reason why it's wrong
But on the other hand, there's a golden band
To remind me of someone who would not understand
On one hand, I could stay and be your lovin' man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand
In your arms, I feel the passions I thought had died
When I looked into your eyes, I found myself
And when I first kissed your lips, I felt so alive
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're somethin' else
Yeah, the reason I must go is on the other hand

===== Randy Travis - Better Class of Losers =====
I'm gettin' out of this high-rise penthouse suite
Where we pretend life's rosy and sweet
I'm going back to the folks that I used to know
Where everyone is what they seem to be
And these high class friends that you like to hang around
When they look my way, they're always looking down
And I'm tired of you spending every dime I make
To finance this way of life I've learned to hate
I'm going back to a better class of losers
This uptown living's really got me down
I need friends who don't pay their bills on home computers
And they buy their coffee beans already ground
You think it's disgraceful that they drink three dollar wine
But a better class of loser suits me fine
You said the grass was greener on the other side
But from where I stand, I can't see grass at all
And the concrete and the steel won't change the way you feel
And it takes more than caviar to have a ball
Yes, a better class of loser just suits me fine

===== Randy Travis - 1982 =====
Operator, please connect me with 1982
I need to make apologies for what I didn't do
I sure do need to tell her that I've thought the whole thing through
And now it's clear that she is what I should have held onto
They say hindsight's 20/20, but I'm nearly goin' blind
From starin' at her photograph and wishing she was mine
It's that same ol' lost love story, it's sad but it's true
There was a time when she was mine in 1982
Postman, can you sell me a special kind of stamp
One to send a letter from this crazy lonely man
Back into the wasted years of my living past
I need to tell her now I know how long my love will last
Losing my mind goin' back in time to 1982

===== Randy Travis - He Walked on Water =====
He wore starched white shirts buttoned at the neck
And he'd sit in the shade and watch the chickens peck
And his teeth were gone, but what the heck
I thought, that he walked, on water
He said he was a cowboy, when he was young
He could handle a rope, and he was good with a gun
And my mama's daddy was his oldest son
And I thought, that he walked, on water
And if the story was told, only heaven knows
But his hat seemed to me, like an old halo
And although his wings, they were never seen
Then he tied a cord, to the end of a mop
And said, "son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot"
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed a lot
Then I'd flop down beside him
And he was ninety years old in '63
And I loved him and he loved me
And lord, I cried the day he died
'Cause I thought, that he walked, on water
And though his wings, they were never seen
Yeah, I thought that he walked, on water

===== Randy Travis - King of the Road =====
Trailers for sale or rent, rooms to let fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets, I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah, but two hours of pushin' broom buys an eight by twelve four bit room
I'm a man of means by no means, king of the road
Third boxcar, midnight train, destination, Bangor, Maine
Old worn out suit and shoes, I don't pay no union dues
I smoke old stogies I have found, short, but not too big around
I know every engineer on every train
All of their children and all of their names
Every handout in every town
And every lock that ain't locked when no one's around
I sing, trailers for sale or rent, rooms to let, fifty cents
Ah, but, two hours of pushin' broom buys an eight by twelve four bit room
Trailers for sale or rent, rooms to let, fifty cents
Two hours of pushin' broom buys an eight by twelve four bit room
King of the road, king of the road

===== Randy Travis - It's Just a Matter of Time =====
Someday, someway
You'll realize that you've been blind
Yes, darlin', you're gonna need me again
It's just a matter of time
Go on, go on
'Til you've reached the end of the line
'Cause I know, you'll pass my way again
After I gave you, everything I had
You laughed and called me a clown
Remember, in your search, for fortune and fame
What goes up, must come down
I... I know, I know
That one day you'll wake up and find
That my love is a true love
Someday, in some way
Girl, you'll realize that you've been blind
Yes, darlin', I know you're gonna need me again
After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and you called me a clown
But remember, in your search, for fortune and fame
That my love was a true love

===== Randy Travis - Fool's Love Affair =====
The phone rings twice then it's through
I don't even have to answer I know it's you
Yes I'll meet you for the one thing we shared
Our once a week fool's love affair
Same ole motel the same ole room
Same ole lines we know can't come true
It's just pretending that the guilt's always there
It's just a once a week fool's love affair
It's a fool's love affair
And we're both aware
It's a game and nobody wins
We can't reveal the love that we feel
So we'll just keep it this way til it ends
We hold each other and then say goodbye
It's seems we ought to but nobody cries
We're two people with nothing to share
But our once a week fool's love affair

===== Randy Travis - Where That Came From =====
She had eyes like diamonds and they caught the light
Oh, but they were dark and deeper than the night
But when she'd smile, out came the sun
And there ain't no more where that came from
She had a dress that swayed all around her knees
And a voice as soft as a summer breeze
A touch that told me I was the one
I must have said to myself, there might be somebody else
Out there, somewhere
I must have said to myself, it's a great big world
Girls are everywhere
Oh, but now I know, there was only one
And it ain't like I ain't been trying to find someone
There just ain't no more where that came from
Oh, where that came from

===== Randy Travis - Too Gone, Too Long =====
You've been too gone for too long
It's too late to come back now
It's been so long since you walked out my door
Now you're just an old song nobody sings anymore
I got a new love and she's a true love
But darlin' how could you have known?
Now it's too late to come back home
You came a long way goin' the wrong way
Don't even set your suitcase down
You wanted to roam, now you're paying the bills
You're an old rolling stone who rolled over the hill
I had a good cry when you said goodbye
I didn't want to let you go
But you've been too gone for too long
Now its too late to come back home
So why don't you just stay gone?
Now you've been too gone for too long

===== Randy Travis - Hard Rock Bottom of Your Heart =====
Since the day I was led to temptation
And in weakness did let your love down
I have prayed that with time and compassion
You'd come around
And I keep waiting for you to forgive me
And you keep saying you can't even start
And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown
To the hard rock bottom of your heart
Now this home we have built is still standing
It's foundation is on solid ground
And do we roll up our sleeves and repair it
Or burn it down?
We can't just block it out
We've got to talk it out
Until our hearts get back in touch
I need your love I miss it
I can't go on like this
It hurts too much
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh

===== Randy Travis - Look Heart, No Hands =====
I remember how it used to feel
Riding down old two mile hill
Tennis shoes up on the handle bars
Paying no mind to the passing cars
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here
No chains, no strings, no fences, no walls
No net, just you to catch me when I fall
Look heart, no hands
It took a little time to get up to speed
To find the confidence and strength I'd need
To just let go and reach for the sky
You know sometimes it felt I could fly
It doesn't take much
Just a smile or a touch
And I'm a kid again
I can almost feel that wind

===== Randy Travis - Is It Still Over? =====
Being without you has turned out to be so inconvenient
And wishing I was with you just seems to use up all my time
You've been gone so long that it's hard to recall just how the dream went
And all but this broken heart and me I guess is doin' fine
Is it still over, are we still through?
Since my phone still ain't ringing, I assume it still ain't you
I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new
But I'm not too sure that I'm still over you
That lie that I tried to slip by you was told with good intentions
It was just another way to say I love you and protect you from the truth
And half a pound of cure is surely worth a half an ounce of good prevention
And trying to explain while I'm insane is the hardest thing
I've ever tried to do
But I'll have to mind to take the time to find somebody new
If I repeat myself it's 'cause I've nothing else to do
And I'm not too sure that I'm still over you
I'm not too sure that I'm still over you

===== Randy Travis - Whisper My Name =====
I heard a freight train out across the way
I heard a woman sing amazing grace
I heard a night bird call to it's mate
When I heard you whisper my name
I heard freedom break it's chain
I heard a heart beat where once no sound remained
I heard Angels rise and praise
I heard music bring a heart of stone to tears
And I heard peace ring like an anthem through the years
And I heard hatred fall from grace
Beating softly against the waves
Fell a sound of an early morning rain
And though the lightin' and thunder came
I still heard you whisper my name

===== Randy Travis - Will the Circle Be Unbroken? =====
I was standing by my window
On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw the hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away
Will the circle be unbroken?
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Well, I went back home, home was lonely
For my mother, she was gone
And all my family there was cryin'
For our home felt sad and alone
Undertaker, undertaker, undertaker
Won't you please drive slow?
For that lady you are hauling
Lord, I hate to see her go

===== Miranda Lambert - Tin Man =====
Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'
For something bound to fall apart
Every time you're feeling empty
Better thank your lucky stars
If you ever felt one breaking
You'd never want a heart
I've been on the road that you're on
It didn't get me very far
You ain't missing nothing
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me, darling
You don't want a heart
I'm glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now
By the way there, Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor
And you can have my heart

===== Miranda Lambert - Mama’s Broken Heart =====
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don't know what I did next, all I know I couldn't stop
Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now, sayin' she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look
Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart
I wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame
Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation (Ah)
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make (Ah)
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face
Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry
Go and fix your make up, well, it's just a break up

===== Miranda Lambert - Vice =====
Sting of the needle dropping on a vinyl
Neon singer with a jukebox title full of heartbreak
33, 45, 78
When it hurts this good you gotta play it twice
Another vice
All dressed up in a pretty black label
Sweet salvation on a dining room table
Waiting on me
Where the numb meets the lonely
It's gone before it ever melts the ice
Another vice, another call
Another bed I shouldn't crawl out of
At 7 AM with shoes in my hand
Said I wouldn't do it, but I did it again
And I know I'll be back tomorrow night, oh
I wear a town like a leather jacket
When the new wears off, I don't even pack it
If you need me
I'll be where my reputation don't precede me
Maybe I'm addicted to goodbyes
Another vice, another town
Where my past can't run me down
Another life, another call
And I know I'll be gone tomorrow night
Mm, another vice
Standing at the sink, not looking in the mirror
Don't know where I am or how I got here
Well, the only thing that I know how to find
Is another vice
Yes, another vice
Ooh, another vice

===== Miranda Lambert - Run =====
Well, it wasn't that you didn't have the answers
There was just no question in my mind
I was gonna run
Mm
And you took too long to see I was unhappy
And I took too long to tell you that I was gonna run
I'm trying to survive in this state of defeat
Is it you or I that really lost me?
I'm lookin' for someone, I wasn't with you
We held on for dear life, babe, but both of us knew I was gonna run
Mm, mm
Oh, this freedom I found, baby, sure wasn't free
I owe you a lifetime of apologies
I'm tellin' the truth now, I love you so much
I'm sorry for lyin' about who I was
Ooh, I always was gonna run

===== Miranda Lambert - Highway Vagabond =====
I wanna go somewhere where nobody knows
I wanna know somewhere where nobody goes
Following gold lines on the ground, northbound, southbound
There's something 'bout the way I feel when the wheels go 'round and 'round and 'round
Highway vagabonds, living like hippies
Moving right along to the next big city
Okay, jump off the exit
Truck stop, rest stop, next stop Texas
Caravan like a wild west show
I don't care, man, as long as we go
My way
Get off one and get on the other
Highway vagabonds
Daddy was a drifter, mama died young
I still don't know where I come from
On the map and off the grid with all my friends
Roaming town to town like Willie did when he was a kid, on the road again
My way, singing for your supper
But if we ain't broke down then we ain't doing something right
But if we ain't broke down then we ain't slowing down, goodnight
Living like hippies (Highway vagabonds)
Moving right along to the next big city (Highway vagabonds)
Living like highway vagabonds (Highway vagabonds)

===== Miranda Lambert - You Wouldn’t Know Me =====
You wouldn't know me if you saw me here
Wake up at your front door no more
You'll never know me by askin' how I been
You'll never keep up that way
Stop sign, stop sign
That's all she threw at me
'Til I don't feel like home no more
Wings on fire, I caught outside of a brand new home
Buried in your heels
I told her you wouldn't know me if you saw me here
That's what I say
Bad news is better than what you've been handing me
What's gone wrong with you, my friend?
Promise me, promise me
Don't ask that of me now
Won't you just send me some word?
I'm changing day to day, that's right
Well, you wouldn't know me
You wouldn't know me

===== Miranda Lambert - Automatic =====
Quarter in a payphone
Drying laundry on the line
Watching Sun Tea in the window
Pocket watch tellin time
Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown cause I couldn't buy it yet
If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic
If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls
And girls would turn them down
Staying married was the only way to work your problems out
Automatic
Let's pull the windows down
Windows with the cranks
Come on let's take a picture
The kind you gotta shake

===== Miranda Lambert - Pushin’ Time =====
Are we fools for rushing in?
'Cause I already dread the end
Lonely ain't no place to start
I guess that's just where we are
Oh, how I remember well
The sunset on September 12th
I disappeared to get a drink
You still kept your eyes on me
Sometimes love acts out of spite
And good things happen over night
Can't take it slow 'cause you and I are pushin' time
I didn't plan on falling fast
I didn't know I could be kissed like that
Now I'm trading miles for minutes
This bed's too big without you in it
You and I are pushin' time
And they say only time can tell
You already know me well
If it has to end in tears
I hope it's in 60 years

===== Miranda Lambert - To Learn Her =====
To love her is to learn her
And see her at her worst
Dance with her when she's drinking
Hold her when she hurts
She'll be happy, you'll be sorry
Well, that's just how it works
Some things you just can't learn
You'll meet her mama, you'll love her daddy
You'll know how much she's worth
You'll have Thanksgiving dinners
And Sunday morning church
You'll be true and you'll be tried
But the tables always turn
It's a lesson, it's a blessing
You don't know everything
If you take her you might hate her
And be left with just a ring
To love her is to lose her
Hey, that's just how it works
Oh, to love her is to learn her

===== Miranda Lambert - Keeper of the Flame =====
I'm walking in their footsteps
I'm singing their old songs
Somebody blazed this trail
I'm treadin' on
I'm bent, but I'm not broken
I'm stronger than I feel
I'm made of flesh and bone
Not made of steel
I'm the keeper of the flame
The teller of the story
Keeper of the flame
For the ones that came before me
For the little pilot lights waiting to ignite
Like fireflies in the rain
I've been burned out to ashes
Waiting for a wind
To carry me and start a fire again
Sometimes I'm just a flicker
A candle in your eye
But I swear to God
I'll never let it die
When I'm drowning
When I'm fighting
When I'm screaming
When I'm hiding
When I'm losing
When I'm winning
I go back to
The beginning
I'm not doing it for the glory
But for those little pilot lights waiting to ignite
Ooh, ooh

===== Miranda Lambert - It All Comes Out in the Wash =====
If you wear a white shirt to a crawfish boil
Stonewashed jeans while you're changing the oil
When you find yourself dating the bridesmaid's ex
You accidentally bring him to the wedding, whoops
If you pour yourself a Merlot to go
You dip your fries in your ketchup on a bumpy road
You spill the beans to your mama, sister got knocked up
In a truck at the 7-Eleven, don't sweat it
'Cause it'll all come out, all come out in the wash
It'll all come out, all come out in the wash
Every little stain, every little heartbreak
No matter how messy it got
You take the sin and the men and you throw 'em all in
And you put that sucker on spin
You got frisky with your boss at the copy machine
You drunk-dialed your ex-husband, don't remember a thing
Had a fancy dinner at your mother-in-law's
Spilled A1 Sauce on her table cloth
Don't sweat it, a Tide stick will get it
(All come out in the wash)
And it'll all come out, all come out in the wash
Put that sucker on spin
You gotta put that sucker on spin
And the laundry list goes like this
Every teardrop, every white lie
Every dirty cotton sheet, let it line dry
All the mistakes, all the wild streaks
That's why the good Lord made bleach, oh-oh
Yeah, put that sucker on spin
Yeah, you put that sucker on spin
And around and around and around and around we go
'Round and around and around and around we go

===== Miranda Lambert - If I Was a Cowboy =====
Oh, ooh-ooh, oh, ooh-ooh
Riding off in the sunset, blue eyes under my Stetson
A little lady on the front porch wishing my heart would start settling
Big iron hips with the holsters
I'd be looking mighty fine on a poster
Wanted by the law but the laws don't apply to me
If I was a cowboy, I'd be wild and free
Rolling around these towns like tumbleweeds
I'd be a legend at loving and leaving
Nipping on a whiskey and numbing up my feelings
You thought the west was wild, but you ain't saddled up with me
If I was a cowboy, I'd be the queen
Sitting pretty on the prairie, baby, I'm your Huckleberry, let me hold you
This six gun sugar's got a hairpin trigger, like I told you
And this dove never really gets lonesome
I never begged, never borrowed, but I stole some
Wanted by the law but the laws don't apply to me, baby
So mammas, if your daughters grow up
To be cowboys, so what?
Oh, ooh-ooh, I'd be the queen

===== Miranda Lambert - Things That Break =====
I was born a bull in a china cabinet
Drawn to the delicate like it's a magnet
Perfume bottles on a mirror tray
Tempered glass on a window pane
Timeless face on a pocket watch
Time is ticking
I leave it all in ruins
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing
I'm hard on things that matter
Hold a heart so tight it shatters
So I stay away from things that break
Can't make a man a promise
With the best of intentions
Drive two hundred miles on a rundown engine
Put a blanket underneath a hollow tree
When the wind blows hard it will fall on me
Stick around long enough and you will see
Me, I don't ever wanna get too close
Or be held responsible
For all the pain that you can't see
Somebody once broke me

===== Miranda Lambert - Wranglers =====
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
When the knock down drag out's over
And Lord knows she took one too many
Well, her blue jean eyes are too tired to cry
And he won't know till she's gone already
If he ever loved her, he never let it show
If she didn't need him, she'd a left him long ago
She set it all on fire, and if there's one thing that she learned
Wranglers takе forever to burn
How long? How much can a broken hеart take?
Who could blame her when it all goes up in flames?
Not a one of us could of done better
Not with that wandering eye, wannabe Marlboro man
It came as no surprise when she finally took a stand
Wranglers take forever to burn
Wranglers take forever
Damn, they take forever to burn

===== Miranda Lambert - White Liar =====
Hey, white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why, white liar
You better be careful what you do
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes
If they ever found you out
You better be careful what you say
It never really added up any way
I got friends in this town
You said you went out to a bar
And walked some lady to her car
But your face has more to tell
'Cause my cousin saw you on the street
With a red head named Bernice
Turns out you don't lie too well
Here's a bombshell just for you
Turns out I've been lyin' too
Now I'm a white liar
Slips off of my tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why
White liar

===== Miranda Lambert - Ugly Lights =====
I don't remember when the liquor started kicking in
It's been a while since I been off the stuff
I really hate to say I'm turning into a cliché
I'm hoping that nobody brings it up
I left my car behind the bar again last Sunday night
I did the Monday morning drive of shame
And last night's clothes, they smell like smoke
But I don't know how I got home
But I do know my head'll hurt all day
But I still go and stay too late
And be the girl bartenders hate
The one that doesn't need another one
When the Romeos and Juliets
Have bummed all of my cigarettes
The last kiss in the parking lot is done
I'll be sitting here alone
When the ugly lights come on
Well, everybody's got a spark
It's easy hiding in the dark
In a crowded room with pockets full of rings
I sit and watch the whiskey pour
The married men, the exit door
The beginning of another matchbook fling
And I don't try to justify
The reason I'm not living right
I wear my sadness like a souvenir
I drink too much to fall apart
That's how I fight this broken heart
So what if I feel comfortable in here?
'Cause I still go and stay too late
Hey

===== Miranda Lambert - More Like Her =====
She's beautiful in her simple little way
She don't have too much to say when she gets mad
She understands; she don't let go of anything
Even when the pain gets really bad
I guess I should've been more like that
You had it all for a pretty little while
And somehow you made me smile when I was sad
You took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart
And then you realized you wanted what you had
I should have held on to my pride
I should have never let you lie
I guess you got what you deserved
I guess I should've been more like her
Forgiving you
Well, she's stronger than I am
You don't look much like a man from where I'm at
It's plain to see desperation showed it's truth
You love her, and she loves you with all she has

===== Miranda Lambert - Getaway Driver =====
When she's feeling reckless
Tangled in her messes
Wild eyes lookin' for a chase
There's nothing white lines can't erase
So I keep the engine running
She'll be my gasoline
She treats my heart like a stolen car
All the while she had the keys
Standing in the line of fire
I'll be right beside her
I'm her getaway driver
Her getaway driver
Miles were the only thing that saved us
Headlights were our only traces
No rear-view mirror, no looking back
Desert horizon as our map
A lover and a fighter
Bonnie and Clyde reminder

===== Miranda Lambert - Use My Heart =====
I can throw a line but I can't reel it in
I can throw a dart but I can't make it stick
The thought of loving you just makes me sick
I don't have the nerve to use my heart
I can write the line but I can't sing the song
I can call my mama but I won't go home
I won't throw a punch but I will turn my cheek
I don't go to church no more but that's what I believe
I don't give two shits no more or so I say
It wouldn't make a difference to you anyway
Use my heart

===== Miranda Lambert - Way Too Pretty for Prison =====
They don't have rhinestone ball and chains
Lunch  trays don't come with Chardonnay
The  bars there ain't got boys to buy us drinks
We'd stick out like two bottled blondes
I must admit it don't sound fun
For  fifteen girls to have to share one sink
He  cheated, he's a villain
And you know I'd help you kill him
But  we're way too pretty for prison
Hard time ain't our kind of livin'
And I don't want to talk about
The way those jumpsuits wash us out
We're  way too pretty for prison
Antifreeze and Gatorade
Arsenic in his lemonade
Takes just one snip to bleed his brakes
But we ain't gonna do it (She ain't gonna do it)
Yeah, we've been watching too much TV
You ain't Thelma, I ain't Louise
But if we ask 'em they'd both agree
We should put him through it (Don't put him through it)
He cheated, he's a villain
So let's hire somebody to kill him
'Cause we're way too pretty for prison
Yeah, hard time ain't our kind of livin'
We're way too pretty for prison
La de da da da (La de da da da)
La de da da, la de da da, la de da da da
Well, the state won't pay for lash extensions
No Sun Tan City, not to mention
That lack of waxing situation
Oh, no
Hard time ain't our kind of livin', no
And I don't wanna talk about
La de da da, la de da da, la de da da da (Hey)
La de da da da (Hey)
La de da da da

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - Great Balls of Fire =====
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain

Well, you got to shake it for me
Now let's go one time
Shake it, baby, shake it
Shake it, baby, shake, ooh
Come on, baby
Shake, baby, shake it

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - Drinking Wine Spo-Dee O’Dee =====
(1966, Memphis Beat version)
Down in New Orleans where everything's fine
All them cats is drinkin' that wine
Drinkin' that mess is their delight
When they get drunk, they singin' all night
Drinkin' wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine
Wine spo-dee-o-dee drinkin' wine
Pass that bottle to me
Now I've got a nickel, honey, you got a dime
Let's get together, gonna have a little wine

When you buy blackberry now you're doin' things smart
Well, I was standing on Bourbon Street in Willie's den
Papa Willie wouldn't sell but a little gin
One cat wanted a bottle of wine
He hooked that cat for a dollar and a dime
Wine, wine, wine, Elderberry
Wine, wine, wine, or Sherry
Wine, wine, wine, Blackberry
Wine, wine, wine, half an' half
Wine, wine, wine, oh boy

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - Another Place, Another Time =====
One by one they're turning out the lights
I've been feedin' that ol' jukebox just to hold you tight
I guess its for the best I just put in my last dime
I heard you whisper "We'll meet again, another place, another time"
Chairs are stacked all over tables its closing time they say
I could wait right here forever if they'd only let me stay
Anywhere would be much better than lonely room of mine
Through a lonely night a waitin' for another place, another time
Won't that room of mine be a lonely place to be
I've been so used to holding you close to me
Won't that old stairway be hard to climb
To a lonely room waiting for another place, another time
To a lonely room to wait for another place, another time

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - Crazy Arms =====
Now, blue ain't the word for the way that I feel
An ol' storm's brewing in this heart of mine
Someday crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While yearning heart keeps saying "you're not mine, not mine, not mine, not mine"
My troubled mind grews blue, to another you'll be wed
{Piano solo}
Now, take all those precious dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday your crazy arms will hold somebody new

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - The Lily of the Valley =====
I have found a friend in Jesus He's everything to me
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
The lily of the valley and in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole
In sorrow He's my comfort in trouble He's my stay
He tells me every care on Him to roll
He's the lily of the valley He's the bright and morning star
He all my grief has taken and all my sorrows borne
In temptation He's my strong and mighty tower
I have all for Him forsaken and all my idols torn
From my heart and now I know He'll keep me by His power
Though all the world forsake me and old Satan he tempts me sore
Through Jesus I shall safely reach that goal
He will never never leave me nor yet forsake me here
While I live by faith and do His blessed will
It's a wall of fire about me but I've nothing now to fear
With His manna He my hungry soul is gonna fill
Then I'll go sweeping up to Glory to see His blessed face
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - Rockin’ My Life Away =====
Fourteen twenty-five and fourteen ninety-eight

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - Middle Age Crazy =====
Today he traded his big 98 Oldsmobile
He got a heck of a deal
On a new Porsche car
He ain't wearing his usual grey business suit
He's got jeans and high boots
With an embroidered star
An' today he's forty years old going on twenty
Don't look for the grey in his hair
'Cause he ain't got any
He's got a young thing beside him
That just melts in his hand
He's middle aged crazy
Trying to prove he still can
He's gotta a woman he's loved for a long, long time at home
Ah but the thrill is all gone
When they cut down the lights
They've got a business that they spent a while coming by
Been a long uphill climb
But now the profits are high
But today he's forty years old going on twenty
And he hears of sordid affairs and he ain't had any
And the young thing beside him
You know she understands
That he's middle aged crazy

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - It’ll Be Me =====
Well, if you hear somebody knocking on your door
If you see something crawling across the floor
Baby, it'll be me and I'll be looking for you
If you see a head a-peeping from a crawdad hole
If you see somebody climbing up a telephone pole
I'm gonna look on the mountain and in the deep blue sea
Gonna search all the forests and look and look in every tree
Well, if you feel something heavy on your fishing hook
If you see a funny face in your comic book
If you hear a thought calling out in the night
If you see somebody hanging from a lamp post bright
Well if you see somebody looking in all the cars
If you see a rocket ship on its way to Mars
Gonna look in the city where the lights are blue
Gonna search the countryside, and all the haystacks, too
We'll, if you see a new face on a totem pole
If you find a lump in your sugar bowl

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - Breathless =====
Hey girl, if you're gonna love me, honey, please don't tease
If I can hold you, baby, let me squeeze
With my heart going round and round
And my love comes a-tumblin' down
You, you leave me (aaah)
Breathless-ah!
Come on and shake all over, I think you know why
They call it love, it couldn't be no lie
Cause when you call my name, uh, I a-burn like a wooden flame
You, leave me (aah)
It's breathless-ah!
Ooh baby, just a little bit crazy
Honey you're much too much, girl I just can't love you enough
Oh, it's alright to hold me tight, but for you to love me then love me right
Oh come on baby now don't be shy this love was meant for you and I
Wind, rain, sleet or snow, I'm gonna get you baby wherever you go
(Rock n' roll, brother!)
Well, ooh baby, it's crazy
Honey, you're much too much, thank god girl I can't love you enough
It's alright to hold me tight, but for you to love me then love me right
C'mon baby, don't be shy, this love was meant for you and I
A-wind, rain, sleet or snow, honey's gonna get you wherever you go

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - Wild One =====
Well, I'm just out of school
I'm real real cool
I got the jump, got the jive
Got the message, I'm alive
I'm a wild, I'm wild one
Ooh, yeah I'm a wild one
I'm gonna keep a-shakin'
I'm gonna keep a-movin', baby
Don't you cramp my style, I'm a real wild child

Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one
Gonna keep a-movin', baby
Don't you cramp my style, I'm real wild child
Yeah!
Well, I gonna pick you up in my '88

Until a whole lotta shakin' goin' be on

Whoa!
Well, I really get to movin' when the sun goes down
Oh, after dark, I can get around
Gonna move on, I'll make every hop

Watch out!

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - Down the Road a Piece =====
Now if you wanna hear some boogie like I'm gonna play
It's just an old piano and a knockout bass
The drummer man's a cat they call Kickin' McCoy
You know, remember that rubber-legged boy?
Mama's cookin' chicken fried and bacon grease
Come on along boys it's just down the road a piece
Well, there's a place you really get your kicks
It's open every night about twelve to six
Now if you wanna hear some boogie you can get your fill
And shove and sting like an old steam drill
Come on along you can lose your lead
Down the road, down the road, down the road a piece
There's a place you really get your kicks

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - Old Black Joe =====
Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay
Gone are the toils of the cotton fields away
Gone to the fields of a better land I know
I hear those gentle voices calling, "Old Black Joe"
I'm coming, I'm coming
For my head is bending low
I'm coming home (I'm coming home)
Oh-oh my head is bending low
Old Black Joe, Old Black Joe, Old Black Joe
Why do I weep when my heart should feel no pain?
Why do I sigh that my friends come not again?
Grieving for forms now departed long ago
I hear their gentle voice calling, "Old Black Joe"
Where are the hearts once so happy and free?
The children so dear that I held upon my knee?
Gone to the shore where my soul has long'd to go

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - Too Much to Gain to Lose =====
Too many miles behind me
Too many trials are through
Too many tears help me to remember
There's too much to gain to lose
Too many sunsets that lie behind the mountains
Too many rivers my feet have walked through
Too many treasures awaiting over yonder
And there's too much to gain to lose
I crossed the hot burning desert
Just struggling the right road to choose
Somewhere up ahead there's cool clear water
And defeat is one word I never use

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - Thirty-Nine and Holding =====
He's out there somewhere every night
Where the music's playing loud
Doing all the fifties steps
In a 1980 crowd
The dim lights hide his mileage lines
The Clairol hides the gray
And he won't mention anything
That gives his age away
Lord, he's thirty-nine and holdin'
Holding everything he can
From seventeen to twenty-five
To prove he's still a man
He's holding to a candle
And it's burning at both ends
He's thirty-nine and holding
You can bet he'll never see
Thirty-nine, again
He should have turned loose long ago
But still-a he's a-hangin' it in
He still thinks that he's the man
That he used to be
And acting twenty-three
Holdin' everything he can
My God, it's burning at both ends!

===== Jerry Lee Lewis - Hadacol Boogie =====
Down in Lou-'si-an'er in the bright sunshine
They do a little boogie-woogie all the time;
They do...
The Hadacol Boogie (Hadacol Boogie)
The Hadacol Boogie
Makes you boogie-woogie all the time
A-standin' on the corner with my bottle in my hand
And up steps a mama, said, my Hadacol man;
She done...
I went down to the farm to rest about a week
But the farmer's wife, she got to walkin' in her sleep;
If your radiator leaks and your motor stands still
Give 'er Hadacol and watch 'er boogie up the hill;
She'll do...
The rooster and the hen, they were standin' in the shade
The rooster done the boogie, while the hen laid the egg;
He done...
The other little chickens, they gathered around
They done the boogie-woogie, til the sun went down;
They done-

===== The Stanley Brothers - Angel Band =====
My latest sun is sinking fast
My race has nearly run
My strongest trials now are past
My triumph is begun
O come, angel band, come and around me stand
O bear me away on your snow white wings to my immortal home
O bear my longing heart to Him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin
And gives me victory

===== The Stanley Brothers - Mountain Dew =====
Down the road here from me there's an old holler tree
Where you lay down a dollar or two
Go on round the bend come back again
There's a jug full of that good ole mountain dew
Oh they call it that good ole mountain dew and them that refuse it are few
I'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good ole mountain dew
Now Mr. Roosevelt told 'em just how he felt
When he heard that the dry law 'd gone through
If your liquors too red it'll swell up your head
You better stick to that good ole mountain dew
The preacher rode by with his head hasted high
Said his wife had been down with the flu
He thought that I o'rt to sell him a quart of my good ole mountain dew
Well my uncle Snort he's sawed off and short he measures four feet two
But he feels like a giant when you give him a pint of that good old mountain dew

===== The Stanley Brothers - Rank Stranger =====
I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free
I looked for my friends but I never could find them
I found they were all rank strangers to me
Everybody I met (Everybody I met)
Seemed to be a rank stranger (Seemed to be a rank stranger)
No mother or dad (No mother or dad)
Not a friend could I see (Not a friend could I see)
They knew not my name (They knew not my name)
And I knew not their faces (And I knew not their faces)
I found they were all (I found they were all)
Rank strangers to me (Rank strangers to me)
"They've all moved away," said the voice of a stranger
"To a beautiful home by the bright crystal sea"
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Where no one will be a stranger to me

===== The Stanley Brothers - Who Will Sing for Me =====
Oft I sing for my friends
When death's cold form I see
When I reach my journey's end
Who will sing one song for me
I wonder (I wonder) who
Will sing (Will sing) for me
When I come to the cross of the silent sea
Who will sing (Who will sing) for me?
When crowds shall gather 'round
And look down on me
Will they turn and walk away
Or will they sing one song for me

===== The Stanley Brothers - Shoutin’ on the Hills of Glory =====
There'll be shouting on the hills of glory
Shouting on the hills shouting on the hills
There'll be shouting on the hills of God
Oh what a blessed reunion
When will we gather over yonder
No more sorrow in that city
Jesus prepared a place in heaven
Now's the time to make your preparations
So stop and make your reservation

===== The Stanley Brothers - I’m a Man of Constant Sorrow =====
I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to old Kentucky
The place where I was borned and raised
(The place where he was borned and raised)
For six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasure here on earth I find
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now
(He has no friends to help him now)
It's fare thee well my own true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon this train
(Perhaps he'll die upon this train)
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave
(While he is sleeping in his grave)
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you'll never will see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore
(He'll meet you on God's golden shore)

===== The Stanley Brothers - Long Journey Home =====
Lost all my money but a two dollar bill
Two dollar bill boys, two dollar bill
I'm on my long journey home
Cloudy in the West and it looks like rain
Looks like rain, boys, looks like rain
It's dark and a raining and I want to go home
Want to go home, boys, want to go home
Its dark and a raining and I want to go home
Homesick and lonesome and I'm feeling kind of blue
Feeling kind of blue, boys, feeling kind of blue
There's black smoke a rising and it surely is a train
Surely is a train boys, surely is a train

===== The Stanley Brothers - Daniel Prayed =====
I heard about a man one day who wasted not his time away
He prayed to God every morning noon and night
He cared not for the things of man he trusted one who would not fail
Oh, Daniel prayed every morning, noon, and night
Oh, Daniel served the living God while here upon this earth he trod
He cared not for the kings decree he trusted God to set him free
And he prayed to God every morning, noon, and night
They cast him in the lion's den because he would not honor men
The jaws were locked and it made him shout, and God soon got them
Safely out
Now brother, let us watch and pray like Daniel did from day to day
We too can gladly daring do the things that God will take us through

===== The Stanley Brothers - That Home Far Away =====
Oh lord have mercy on this weary soul of mine
May I walk in your light everyday
And when I've crossed that deep silent river
I'll be happy in that home far away
I wandered away from the straight and the narrow
Driftin' like a ship lost at sea
No lighthouse to guide my weary footsteps
Til Jesus answered my plea
The lights are bright no longer I'm blinded
From the bondage of sin I'm free
He lifted me up to join salvation
I'll live on eternally

===== The Stanley Brothers - The Darkest Hour Is Just Before Dawn =====
The darkest hour is just before dawn
The narrow way leads home
Lay down your soul at Jesus' feet
The sun is slowly sinking
The day is almost gone
Still darkness falls around us
And we must journey on
Like a shepherd out on the mountain
A watching the sheep down below
He's coming back to claim us
Will you be ready to go?

===== The Stanley Brothers - Paul and Silas =====
Paul and Silas bound in jail (All night long)
Cryin', Who shall deliver for me?
Jailor come and locked the jail (All night long)
That old jail it reeled and rocked (All night long)
Paul and Silas prayed to God (All night long)
Hebrew children in the burnin' fire (All night long)

===== The Stanley Brothers - How Far to Little Rock =====
Hello, stranger
(Why, hello there, stranger)
Ah, could you tell me how far it is to Little Rock?
(Well no sir I couldn't, buddy, but they's a devil of a big'n down here in Pap's old field)
(Why, hello again, stranger)
Your corn looks awful little and yellow
(Ah, I planted the little yellow kind this year)
Well, you must not be figuring on much more than half a crop, are ya?
(That's exactly right, I'm raisin' on the shares, 50/50)
You couldn't be very far from a fool
(Couldn't be what?)
Very far from a fool
(That's right, son, just this microphone here between us)
How did your potatoes turn out?
(Son, you'll have to speak a little louder, I don't hear too well out of this left ear)
I said how did your taters turn out!
(Oh, my taters. They didn't turn out a'tall, the old sow rooted them out)
(Hello, there, stranger)
Would you head that cow there for me?
(Buddy, she's got a head)
Well, turn her, then
(The hairy side's turned out)
Well, would you speak to her?
(Good morning, old heifer)
Why don't you cover your house?
(Well, when it's raining I can't, buddy, and when the sun is shining it don't leak)
How far did you say it was to Little Rock?
(Buddy, ain't you found out how far it is yet?)
I can't, I can't find out a'tall
(Well, I'm sure glad to tell you, buddy, it's three lengths of a fool. If you don't believe it, lay down and measure it sometime)

===== The Stanley Brothers - The Lonesome River =====
I sit here alone on the banks of the river
The lonesome wind blows the water rolls high
I hear a voice calling out there in the darkness
I sit here alone too lonesome to cry
Oh the water rolls high on the river at midnight
I sit on the shore to grieve and to cry
The woman I love she left me this morning
With no one to love or kiss me goodnight
We met there one night by the banks of the river
Sat there holding hands and making our vows
Swore we'd never part and be happy together
But a new love she's found she's gone from me now

===== The Stanley Brothers - How Mountain Girls Can Love =====
Get down boys, go back home
Back to the girl you love
Treat her right, never wrong
How mountain girls can love
Riding the night in the high cold winds
On the trail of the old lonesome pine
Thinking of you, feeling so blue
Wondering why you left me behind
Remember the night we strolled down the lane
Our hearts were gay and happy then
You whispered to me as I held your close
You hoped this night would never end

===== The Stanley Brothers - Precious Memories =====
Precious memories, unseen angel
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me
And the sacred past unfolds
Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Echoes from the past I hear
Old time singing, gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhere
Precious memories

===== The Stanley Brothers - The White Dove =====
In the deep rolling hills of old Virginia
There's a place that I love so well
Where I spent many days of my childhood
In the cabin where we loved to dwell
White dove will mourn in sorrow
The willows will hang their heads
I'll live my life in sorrow
Since mother and daddy are dead
We were all so happy there together
In our peaceful little mountain home
But the Savior needs angels up in heaven
Now they sing around the great white throne
As the years roll by I often wonder
If we will all be together someday
And each night as I wander through the graveyard
Darkness finds me as I kneel to pray

===== The Stanley Brothers - I’m Ready to Go =====
Chorus:
Hallelujah, I'm ready
I can hear the voices singing soft and low
Hallelujah, I'm ready, hallelujah I'm ready to go
In the darkness of night, not a star was in sight
On the highway that leads down below
But Jesus came in and saved us all from sin
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go
--- Instrumental ---
Sinners don't wait until it's too late
He's a wonderful saviour you know
Well, I fell on my knees when he answered my plea's
Hallelujah, I'm ready to go...

===== The Stanley Brothers - The Story of the Lawson Family =====
Friends this is a true story that happened in the hills of western North Carolina on Christmas (December 25th) in 1929. This tragedy occured near the little town of Danburry in Stokes county in the state of North Carolina. It's absolutely true. This man murdered 6 of his children (including a 4 month old infant), his wife, and then, himself. His oldest son survived because his father sent him on an errand before he committed the murders. His name was Charles "Charlie" David Lawson, and this song is entitled, "The Story of the Lawson Family."
It was long last Christmas evening
The snow was on the ground
At his home in North Carolina
The murderer, he was found
His name was Charlie Lawson
And he had a loving wife
But they never knew what caused him
To take his family's life
They say he killed his wife at first
While the little one did cry
Please papa won't you spare us
How it is so hard to die
But the raging man could not be stopped
He would not heed their call
He kept on firing fatal shots
And there he killed them off
While the little ones did cry
They did not carry him to jail
No lawyers would be paid
They'll have his trial in another land
On the final judgement day
They all were all buried in a crowded grave
While the angels watched from above
Come home, come home my little ones
To the land of peace and God
And... farewell ...
I'll see you there no more
But when we meet in another land
Our trouble will be gone

===== The Stanley Brothers - Think of What You’ve Done =====
Is it true that I've lost you
Am I not the only one
After all this pain and sorrow
Darling think of what you've done
Heart to heart dear how I need you
Like the flowers need the dew
Loving you has been my life, dear
I can't believe we're really through
I'll go back to old Virginia
Where the mountains meet the sky
In those hills I learned to love you
Let me stay there till I die

===== The Stanley Brothers - The Fields Have Turned Brown =====
I left my old home to ramble this country
My mother and dad said, "Son don't go wrong
Remember that God will always watch over you
And we will be waiting for you here at home"
"Son, don't go astray", was what they both told me
"Remember that love for God can be found"
But now they're both gone, this letter just told me
For years they've been dead, the fields have turned brown
For many long years I traveled in sorrow
No thoughts of the day when I would return
Now as I go home and find no one waiting
The price I have paid to live and to learn

===== Reba McEntire - Fancy =====
I remember it all very well looking back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one-room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
Then mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancing dress
Well, Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
Then she painted my eyes and lips (Lips)
Then I stepped into a satin dancing dress
That had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it had fit me good
Well, standing back from the looking glass
There stood a woman where a half-grown kid had stood
She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
Then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said, "Your Pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death"
She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said
"To thine own self be true"
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high-heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talking
Asking Mama, "What do I do?"
She said, "Just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you"
She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out, well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down now
Your Mama's gonna move you uptown"
Well, that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
It wasn't very long until I knew exactly
What my Mama'd been talking about
I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I was gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might've been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name
It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
And one week later I was pouring his tea
In a five-room hotel suite (Yes, she was)
I charmed a king, congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
Then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad (She ain't done bad)
Now in this world
There's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites that call me bad
They criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry about nothing
For nigh on fifteen years
Well, I can still hear the desperation
In my poor Mama's voice ringing in my ears
"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Oh, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Now don't let me down, hon'
Oh, and I guess she did

===== Reba McEntire - The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia =====
He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he thought he'd stop
At Web's and have him a drink 'fore he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said hello, he said, "Hi, what's new?" and Wo said
"Sit down, I got some bad news that's gonna hurt"
Said, "I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you've been gone, she's been seein' that Amos boy, Seth"
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, "Boy, don't you lose your head
'Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself"
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
'Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands
Well, Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home 'cause he didn't live far
You see, Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must have left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Daddy had left him, and that was a gun
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the backwoods quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood, and he started to shake
The Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag 'em down
A big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
"Why'd you do it?"
The judge said guilty on a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
He said, "Supper's waiting at home and I gotta get to it"
Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see, little sister don't miss when she aims her gun

===== Reba McEntire - Consider Me Gone =====
Every time I turn the conversation
To something deeper than the weather
I can feel you all but shutting down
And when I need an explanation for the silence
You just tell me you don't wanna talk about it now
What you're not saying is coming in loud and clear
We're at a crossroads here
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone
With you, I've always been wide open, like a window or an ocean
There is nothing I've ever tried to hide
So when you leave me not knowing where you're going
I start thinking that we're looking, we're looking at goodbye
How about a strong shot of honesty?
Don't you owe that to me?
Consider me a memory
Consider me the past
Consider me a smile in an old photograph
Someone who used to make you laugh
Just consider me gone

===== Reba McEntire - Going Out Like That =====
It's been awhile since she put that red dress on
And slipped into those high heels
She's got a couple of new guys blowing up her phone
And she loves the way that that feels
You'd never know she was going through a break up
There ain't a single tear messing up her make up
He thought she'd be sitting home crying
But she ain't goin' out like that
She's had enough of feeling like dying
She ain't goin' out like that
Everybody, here comes the life of the party, yeah, she is
He might have left her brokenhearted
But she ain't goin' goin out like that
She's got her hands up dancin' like the floor's on fire
Yeah she's the hottest thing in here
Guess she finally got tired of being sick and tired
Now she's lookin like she don't care
If she was hurting, well she must've forgot
She's smiling while she's throwing back shots
Everybody, here comes the life of the party

===== Reba McEntire - Does He Love You =====
I've known about you for a while now
When he leaves me he wears a smile now
As soon as he's away from me
In your arms is where he wants to be
But you're the one he rushes home to
You're the one he gave his name to
I never see his face in the early morning light
You have his mornings, his daytimes
And sometimes I have his nights
But does he love you? (does he love you?)
Like he loves me (like he loves me)
Does he think of you? (does he think of you?)
When he's holding me
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies?
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been loving me?
But when he's with me, he says he needs me
And that he wants me, that he believes in me
And when I'm in his arms, oh he swears there's no one else
Is he deceiving me, or am I deceiving myself?
Oh, shouldn’t I lose my temper?
Oh, and shouldn’t I be ashamed?
Cause I have everything to lose
And I, I have nothing to gain

===== Reba McEntire - I'm A Survivor =====
I was born three months too early
The doctor gave me thirty days
But I must've had my momma's will
And God's amazing grace
I guess I'll keep on livin'
Even if this love's to die for
'Cause your bags are packed and I ain't cryin'
You're walkin' out and I'm not tryin' to change your mind
'Cause I was born to be
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of the circumstance
The one who ought to give up
But she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
I don't believe in self-pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
And though my life is changing fast
And who I am is who I wanna be
Oh, a single mom who works two jobs
But I must've had my mamma's will and God's
Amazing grace

===== Reba McEntire - Because Of You =====
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die in your sleep)
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
(You never saw me)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing

===== Reba McEntire - Is There Life Out There =====
She married when she was twenty
She thought she was ready, now she's not so sure
She thought she'd done some living
Now she's just wondering what she's living for
Now she's feeling that there's something more
Is there life out there?
So much she hasn't done
Is there life beyond
Her family and her home?
She's done what she should
Should she do what she dares?
She doesn't want to leave
She's just wondering is there life out there?
She's always lived for tomorrow
She's never learned how to live for today
Oh, she's dying to try something foolish
Do something crazy or just get away
Oh, something for herself for a change
There's a place in the sun that she's never been
Where life is fair and time is a friend
Would she do it the same as she did back then?
Oh, she looks out her window and she wonders again
Oh, is there life out there?
Oh, oh
Oh, she doesn't want to leave

===== Reba McEntire - If You See Him, If You See Her =====
If you see him
Tell him I wish him well
How am I doin'?
Well, sometimes it's hard to tell
I still miss him more than ever
But please don't say a word
Oh, if you see him
If you see her
Tell her I'm doin' fine
And if you want to
Say that I think of her from time to time
Ask her if she ever wonders
Where we both went wrong
Oh, I... I still want her
And I still need him so
Oh, I don't know why we let each other go
Tell her the light's still on for her
Nothing's changed
Deep down the fire still burns for him
And even if it takes forever
Say I'll still be here

===== Reba McEntire - Back To God =====
Oh, have you looked around
Have you heard the sound
Of Mama's crying
Or do you turn away
When you see the face
Of the innocent dying
In these darkest days
Are you not afraid?
That it's too late
You gotta get down on your knees
Believe, fold your hands, and beg and plead
Gotta keep on praying
You gotta cry, rain, tears of pain
Pound the floor, and scream His name
'Cause we're still worth saving
Can't go on like this, and live like this
We can't love like this
We gotta give this world
Back to God
Have you lost a love?
Do you feel like giving up?
Has your heart been broken?
Are your kids okay?
Will they come home safe?
Do you lie there hoping?
You can make a wish
You can knock on wood
Ohh, it won't do no good
Keep on! praying
You can hope the best
Make a wish
The only answer is
We give this world back to God
Ohh, give it back ...

===== Reba McEntire - Turn On The Radio =====
No good, two-timin', lies comin' out of your mouth
Cheatin', mistreatin' games that you play brought you down
Broke my heart, tore it apart, look who's got the last laugh now
Don't you come crawlin' back, beggin' please on your knees
Baby, if you're missin' me
Well, you can hear me on the radio (Radio)
You wanna turn me on, turn on your stereo (Stereo)
You can sing along
While they're playin' our song, how you done me wrong
Baby, crank it up (Crank it up)
Until you blow the speakers out your Chevy truck (Chevy truck)
So listen, Romeo
When you're feelin' kinda low, let me tell you where to go
Turn on the radio
Try to call, Twitter me, text until your fingers bleed
Oh, the DJ's the only way you're ever gonna hear from me
If you're reminiscin' and you're missin' me this much
And you really wanna stay in touch
While they're playin' my song, how you done me wrong
Turn on your radio (Turn on your radio)
Woah, turn on the radio (Turn on the radio, oh)
Turn on the radio, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, you can hear me on the radio
You wanna turn me on, turn on your stereo
Turn on your radio
Turn on, turn on the radio (Turn on the radio, turn on the radio)
Turn on the radio, oh
Turn on you radio, oh, oh, oh

===== Reba McEntire - One Promise Too Late =====
I would have waited forever
If I'd known that you'd be here
We could have shared our lives together
And held each other close all through the years
But I've met someone before you
And my heart just couldn't wait
So no matter how much I adore you
I've got to stand behind the promise that I made
Where were you when I could have loved you?
Where were you when I gave my heart away?
All my life
I've been dreaming of you
You came along one promise too late
I won't say that I'm sorry that I met you
I can't have you but I never will forget you

===== Reba McEntire - Silent Night =====
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heav'nly hosts sing Alleluia;
Christ the Savior is born
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

===== Reba McEntire - The Heart Won't Lie =====
Looking back over the years
Of all the things I've always meant to say
But the words didn't come easily
So many times through empty fears
Of all the nights I tried to pick up the phone
So scared of who might be answering
You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away
Because the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's one thing that won't change
I know I've tried
The heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
You can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
Long after tonight
Will you still hear my voice through the radio
Old desires make us act carelessly
Long after tonight, after the fire
After the scattered ashes fly
Through the four winds blown and gone
Will you come back to me?

===== Reba McEntire - Whoever's In New England =====
You spend an awful lot of time in Massachusetts
Seems like every other week
You've got a meeting waiting there
Business must be booming or could something else
Be moving in the air up there
You say that it's important for our future
An executive on his way up has got to play the part
And each time duty calls, you got to give it all
You've got with all your heart
When whoever's in New England is through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late
'Cause you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you
I hear the winter time up north can last forever
I've been told it's beautiful to see this time of year
They say the snow can blind you till the world you left behind
Just disappears I hear
I've packed your bags and left them in the hallway
But before you leave again
There's just one thing you ought to know
When the icy wind blows through you remember that it's me
Who feels the cold most of all
And you'll always have a place to come back to

===== Reba McEntire - Little Rock =====
I'm married to the good life
I said I'd be a good wife
When I put on this ring
I drive a new Mercedes
Play tennis with the ladies
And buy all the finer things
But all that don't mean nothing
When you can't get a good night's loving
Oh, little rock
Think I'm going to have to slip you off
Take a chance tonight and untie the knot
There's more to life than what I've got
Whoa oh, little rock
You know this heart of mine just can't be bought
I'm going to find someone who really cares a lot
When I slip off this little rock
Well, I wonder if he'll miss me
He doesn't even kiss me
When he comes home at night
He never calls me honey
But he sure loves his money
And I'm the one who pays the price
But when he finds this ring he'll see
He keeps everything but me
Oh, you little rock
Little rock, oh yeah

===== Reba McEntire - The Greatest Man I Never Knew =====
The greatest man I never knew
Lived just down the hall
And everyday we said hello
But never touched at all
He was in his paper
I was in my room
How was I to know he thought I hung the moon?
Came home late every night
He never had too much to say
Too much was on his mind
I never really knew him
Well, now it seems so sad
Everything he gave to us took all he had
Then the days turned into years
And the memories to black and white
He grew cold like an old winter wind
Blowing across my life
The greatest words I never heard
I guess I'll never hear
The man I thought could never die
He's been dead almost a year
Oh, he was good at business
But there was business left to do
He never said he loved me
Guess he thought I knew

===== Reba McEntire - You Lie =====
We lie in the dark I know you're awake
The only sounds are the sounds this old house makes
But, oh, how I long, I long to hear your voice
Desperate to talk, yearning to touch
Burning inside because I want you so much
So I say I need you and leave you no choice
You lie you don't want to hurt me
So you lie, buy a little time, and I go along
What else can I do? Maybe it's wrong
But you know how much I love you
So you lie until you can find a way to say goodbye
You lie
How long until you just can't go on?
And the urge to break loose is just too strong
You should let go that's what you want to do
Oh, but you don't know, you don't know
If it's the right thing to do

===== Reba McEntire - You're Gonna Be =====
6lbs and 9oz. looking up at me
Like I have all the answers
I hope I have the ones you need
I've never really done this
Now I know what scared is
Sometimes I'll protect you from everything that's wrong
Other times I'll let you just find out on your own
But that's when you'll be growing
And the whole time I'll be knowing
You're going to fly with every dream you chase
You're going to cry
But know that that's okay
Sometimes life's not fair
But if you hang in there
You're going to see that sometimes bad is good
We just have to believe things work out like they should
Life has no guarantees
But always loved by me
You're going to be
I'm afraid you'll have to suffer through
Some of my mistakes
Lord knows I'll be trying
Oh, to give you what it takes
What it takes to know the difference
Between getting by and living
Because anything worth doing is worth doing all the way
Just know you'll have to live with all
The choices that you make
So make sure you're always giving way
More than you're taking
Someone's everything
You're going to see
Just what you are to me
Always loved by me

===== Reba McEntire - He Gets That From Me =====
His early morning attitude
You have to drag him out of bed
Only frosted flakes will do
He gets that from me
Yeah, he gets that from me
His curly hair and his knobby knees
The way the sun brings those freckles out
Talk and talk and never miss a beat
He looks at me with those big brown eyes
He's got me in the palm of his hands
And I swear sometimes
It's just like you're here again
He smiles that little crooked smile
There's no denying he's your child
Without him, I don't know what I'd do
He gets that from you
Oh, he gets that from you
How he loves your old guitar
Yeah, he's taught himself to play
He melts my heart
Tells me he loves me every day
And cracks a joke at the perfect time
Makes me laugh when I want to cry
That boy is everything to me
Last night I heard him pray
"Lord, help me and Momma make it through
And tell Daddy we'll be okay"
He said he sure misses you
He sure misses you
He really misses you

===== Jerry Reed - East Bound and Down =====
East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
We gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm east bound, just watch ol' Bandit run
Keep your foot hard on the pedal
Son, never mind them brakes
Let it all hang out 'cause we've got a run to make
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta
And there's beer in Texarkana
And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes
Old Smokey's got them ears on
He's hot on your trail
And he ain't gonna rest 'til you're in jail
So you got to dodge him, you got to duck him
You've gotta keep that diesel truckin'
Just put that hammer down and give it hell

===== Jerry Reed - Amos Moses =====
Yeah, here comes Amos
Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by his self in the swamp
He hunted alligator for livin'
He just knock 'em in the head with a stump
The Louisiana law gonna get you Amos!
It ain't legal huntin' alligator down in the swamp boy!
Now everybody blamed his old man
For makin' him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy
His Daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist and throw him in the swamp
Alligator bait in the Louisiana Bayou
About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana
Lived a man called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Well, they raised up a son that could eat up his weight in groceries
They named him after a man of the cloth, called him Amos Moses
Now all the folks around south Louisiana
Said Amos was a hell of a man
He could trap the biggest, the meanest alligator
And just use one hand
That's all he got left cuz alligator bit it!
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow!
Well the Sheriff got wind that Amos
Was in the swamp tracking alligator skin
So he snuck in the swamp, gonna get the boy
But he never come out again
Well I wonder where the Louisiana Sheriff went to?
Well you can sure get lost in the Louisiana Bayou!
Lived a cat called Doc Millsap and his pretty wife Hanna
Set out on 'em Amos
Make it count, Son!
About forty-five minutes southeast of Thibodeaux, Louisiana...

===== Jerry Reed - The Legend =====
You heard about the legend of Jesse James
And John Henry, just to mention some names
But there's a truck-drivin' legend in the South today
A man called Bandit from Atlanta, G.A
Every gearjammer knows his name
They swear he got ice water runnin' in his veins
A foot like lead and nerves like steel
He's gonna go to glory ridin' eighteen wheels
Oh, honey hooves 
Well, he left Atlanta back in '63
Haulin' him a load up to Tennessee
He hit Monteagle and it started to rain
So hard he couldn't even see the passin' lane
Well, he started downgrade when he lost a gear
He reached for the brakes, found he had no air
That Monteagle grade is steep and long
And everybody that seen it thought the Bandit was gone
Well, well listen now
Well, his truck jack-knifed, turned completely 'round
He was comin' down backwards, 'bout the speed of sound
A lot of folks seen him, and they all say
He had his head out the window, yellin', Clear the way
Well, he got to the bottom, safe and sound
Everybody asked Bandit how he made it down
He said, Folks, when the truck picked up too much speed
I just run along beside it and drug my feet
You heard the legend of Jesse James
Well, there's a truck-drivin' legend in the South today
They swear he's got ice water runnin' in his veins
Aww, help him get down 
Mercy 
Get down, hon' 

===== Jerry Reed - The Ballad Of Gator Mcklusky =====
He was raised in the swamp
In the back of a slough
He grew up eatin' rattlesnake meat
And drinkin' homemade brew
Now folks here about call him Gator
And everybody knows him well
Meanest man ever to hit the swamp
Folks swear he come straight outta hell
Well Gator Mcklusky sittin' on a stump
Hammer pulled back on a twelve gauge pump
Watchin' that swamp lookin' out for the law
While he make the best corn liquor you ever saw
(Rot gut whiskey...)
While he's makin' that mash he watches and he looks
Old Gator he knows that swamp like a book
Somethin' out there movin' Gator whaddaya see
Ain't nothin' but the snakes and the gators and me
Everything's okey-dokey in the Okefenokee
That sheriff ain't snoopin' around
So cook that moonshine down
'Til it's good and clear
That sheriff he'd soon mess around with the devil
Than to get his self long messin' around in here
One day he was cookin' some mash he was almost done
When they spotted the law and they had to run
So he headed for the swamp and they followed him in
But the law might as well been a-chasin' the wind
(Look out for that snake, sheriff...)
Well they chased on back through the muck and the slime
To the back of that swamp where the sun don't shine
But the law won't never catch Gator my friend
'Cause he knows that swamp like the back of his hand
Watch out boys old smokey's in the Okefenokee
The sheriff's out there snoopin' around
So shut that business down
And let's disappear
Look out boys old smokey's in the Okefenokee
But that sheriff he's really gonna catch the devil
If he keeps on snoopin' around in here
(Gator's in the swamp, sheriff...)
(Go get him...)
(If you can...)
(Careful, sheriff...)
(Don't let that gator bite you on your gonads...)

===== Jerry Reed - West Bound and Down =====
West bound and down, eighteen wheels are rollin'
We're gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm west bound, just watch ol' "Bandit" run
Keep your foot hard on the pedal. Son, never mind them brakes
Let it all hang out 'cause we got a run to make
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta and there's beer in Texarcana

===== Jerry Reed - When You’re Hot, You’re Hot =====
Well, now me and Homer Jones and Big John Talley
Had a big crap game goin' back in the alley
And I kept rollin' them sevens and winnin' all them pots
My luck was so good, I could do no wrong
I just kept on rollin' and controllin' them bones
Finally, they just threw up their hands and said
"When you hot, you hot," I said, "Yeah"
When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're not
Put all the money in and let's roll 'em again
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, when you're hot, you're hot
Well, now every time I rolled them dice, I'd win
And I was just gettin' ready to roll 'em again
When I heard somethin' behind me
I turned around and there was a big old cop
He said, "Hello, boys," then he gave us a grin, said
"Look like I'm gon' have to haul y'all in
And keep all that money for evidence"
I said, "Well, son when you hot, you hot," he said, "Yeah"
"You can 'splain it all down at City Hall"
I said, "Yeah, when you're hot, you're hot"
Well, when he took us in to court, I couldn't believe my eyes
The judge was a fishin' buddy that I recognized
I said, "Hey, judge, old buddy, old pal
I'll pay you that hundred I owe you if you'll get me outta this spot"
So he gave my friends a little fine to pay
He turned around and grinned at me and said
"Ninety days, Jerry, when you hot, you hot"
And I said, "Thanks a lot"
He let my friends go free and throwed the book at me
He said, "Well, when you're hot, you're hot"
I said, "Well, I'll tell you one thing, judge, old buddy, old pal
If you wasn't wearin' that black robe
I'd take you out in back of this courthouse
And I'd try a little bit of your honor on"
"You understand that, you hillbilly?
Who's gonna collect my welfare? Pay for my Cadillac?
What do you mean "Contempt of Court"?
Judge, oh, judge, judgie-poo"

===== Jerry Reed - The Bandit =====
They call you the Bandit, an outlaw untamed
Shackled only by freedom, you wear no man's chain
Some say they despise you, well maybe they do
But deep down inside them, I bet they wish they were you
Bandit, you're reckless, and you live much too hard
Bandit, you're the joker in the deal of the cards
You're a legend to the old man, a hero to the child
Bandit, steal a lady's heart with only a smile
They call you the Bandit, they call you the Bandit
Thеy call you the Bandit, they call you the Bandit

===== Jerry Reed - Patches =====
I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
'Cause deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands, see
Education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
For, life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
One day Papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said
He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you
Two days later Papa passed away, and
I became a man that day
So I told Mama I was gonna quit school, but
She said that was Daddy's strictest rule
So ev'ry mornin' 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
I tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest
Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of 13 I thought
I was carryin' the weight of the
Whole world on my shoulders
And you know, Mama knew
What I was goin' through, 'cause
Ev'ry day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of the family
And ev'rybody else depended on me
Ev'ry night I heard my Mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to face another day
So years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took Mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice kept me through the years
Sing
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
Oh, I can still hear Papa's voice sayin'
I've tried to do my best
I can still hear Papa, what he said
Patches...

===== Jerry Reed - You Took All The Ramblin’ Out Of Me =====
You took all the ramblin' outta me, girl
With the finest lovin' I ever done seen
Now all I wanna do is sit home and play my little guitar
And sing songs about all the places that I've seen, mmm
Your country lovin' and your country cookin'
Done blowed my mind and set me free
You took away all my urge to roam
All I wanna do is just hang around home
'Cause you took all the ramblin' outta me
How I wound up down here in Monroe
Is somethin' I'm never gonna figure out, it's true
But your sweet love settled me down
Made me quit all my ramblin' round
Now all I wanna do is sit home and grow old with you
Last night I heard a freight train through my window
And I couldn't help thinkin' that I heard that whistle scream
Now that old lonesome sound don't make me itch and wanna move around
Because you took all the ramblin' outta me, yeah
And sing songs about all the places that I've seen, mm
Now all I wanna do is just hang around home
A-one more time, sing it son
And sing songs . . 

===== Jerry Reed - Another Puff =====
I know there's a lotta talk going around today
About cigarette smoking whittling your life away
I've seen it and I've heard it so many times
That finally it just started to prey on my mind
I guess it scared me a little bit
That's why I decided I was gonna quit
So while I was sitting here forming my battle plan
I took another puff and turned on the fan
I just sat there in my easy chair
And thought of all the money I'd wasted on cigarettes all these years
I thought how I'd spend the rest of my days
After I kick this habit my body craves
Said to myself this ain't gonna be so tough
With that little bit of assurance
I took another puff
I took a puff, a puff, then I ripped off another puff
I decided I'd about had about enough
That breaking this habit won't be too tough
Now I've give a lot of thought to this thing
If I didn't smoke cigarettes I'd feel just like a king
Besides with the price going up every day
I knew I was just throwing all my good money away
You know I ain't lit one in an hour or so?
Just wanted to make sure I could quit you know
I was thinking maybe I oughta write all this down
Put it in a song kinda circulate it around
Can't ever tell it might make a hit
And that redneck Hall did a little bit
Can you imagine me a hit songwriter!
Now where's... Where'd I put that cigarette lighter?
After all it's a habit and a habit you can break
Just a little bit of willpower son that's all it takes
I said to myself you got to be tough!
And with that little bit of wisdom
I took a puff, and then a puff, then I finally ripped off another puff
And I decided boy this ain't gonna be tough
Besides I'd just about had enough
I'm about ready to quit this rotten habit anyway
Oh I think they ought to take it offa television
It looks too good! Ow!
I like them skinny ones with the filter
Oh give it to me! Give it to me!
Cigarettes... I say if I quit smoking what'll I do?
Maybe I'll eat
Yeah I'll eat cigarettes
Ahh, I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it
Chester B don't smoke, he smokes logs!
Makes you laugh funny too
Oh my throat's scratchin', oh
I wish I could think of something bad to say about cigarettes
Boo on cigarettes, don't smoke don't smoke don't smoke
You quit smoking that'll leave more for me!
I love it I love it, no I don't love cigarettes ya know
Don't misunderstand me I hate cigarettes
Makes ya cough, and when ya don't smoke it makes ya shake
I don't know what's worse, the shake or the cough
I think I'll make me a coughshake, oh!
Son did you ever smoke?
Oh I remember one time I quit smoking
I quit for three months
My wife left me
So did my children
She took my house and left
It was a mobile home

===== Jerry Reed - Guitar Man =====
Well, I quit my job down at the car wash
Left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went a hauntin' them nightclubs
Just lookin' for a place to play
Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man
Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis
I run outta money and luck
So I bummed me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started checkin' out some o' them all night bars
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar
Makin' music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
We don't need a guitar man, son
So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jammin'
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed 'em what a band would sound like
With a swingin' little guitar man
Show 'em, son
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band
Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man

===== Jerry Reed - Today Is Mine =====
Today Is Mine
When the sun came up this morning I took the time to watch it rise
As its beauty struck the darkness from the skies
I thought how small and unimportant all my troubles seem to be
And how lucky another day belongs to me
And as the sleepy world around me woke up to greet the day
And all its silent beauty seemed to say:
So what, my friend, if all your dreams you haven't realized
Look around, you got a whole new day to try
Today is mine, today is mine, to do with what I will
Today is mine. My own special cup to fill
To die a little that I might learn to live
And take from life that I might learn to give
Today is mine
With all men I curse the present that seems void of peace of mind
And race my thoughts beyond tomorrow and vision there more peace of mind
But when I view the day around me I can see the fool I've been
For today is the only garden we can tend

===== Jerry Reed - A Thing Called Love =====
Six foot six he stood on the ground weighed two hundred and thirty five pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love
He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him cryin' like a little whipped pup because of love
Can't see it with your eyes hold it in your hand but like the wind that covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of any man this thing called love
It can lift you up it can let you down take your world turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love
Most men are like me they struggle in doubt
They trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with livin' to worry about a word called love
But when I see a mother's tenderness as she holds her young close to her brest
Than I thank God this world's been blessed with a word called love
Can't see it with your eyes...

===== Jerry Reed - The Uptown Poker Club =====
Well now Bill Jackson went to poor ol' Dub
To join the Uptown Poker Club
And he cursed the day he ever told anybody he joined
Cause his money used to go like it had wings
When he had queens somebody else had kings
And every night he'd just sit there donatin' all his coins
He said boys now I'm gonna play it right tonight
I'm gonna watch them cards and I'm gonna play 'em tight
And then when I come in there son my hand's gonna be a peach
Well he played 'em tight but after awhile
He done lost his self a considerable pile
So he got mad he stood up and he made this little speech
Now boys you see this razor well I had it sharpened just today
Now I'm comin' in here with my rules that everybody gonna follow when they play
Now you Clyde you keep your hands on top of the table when you're dealing please
Quit takin' them little wild cards and stickin' em down there between your knees
And Jesse quit makin' all them funny signs like you tryin' to tip off your hand
You better talk to me in American son American so's I can understand
And Leroy quit takin' em offa the bottom ooh that's rough
Just take five off the top then stop that's enough
Then pass me them cards son let me cut on them things every time before you deal
I like to handle them things boy I like to see
Cause I got news for you lad you ain't playin' this game accordin' that fella Hoyle there
Uh uh no tonight you're playin' this game accordin' to me
Well now a sittin' around the table in that there game
There just happened to be this ol' one-eyed man
And Bill kept watchin' him out of the corner of his eye
This old one-eyed cat he'd been dealin' kinda funny
He done took a whole bunch of big Bill's money
So Bill rose up and he looked around the room and with a sigh
He said hmm said it's an awful shame
Said there's somebody cheatin' in this here game
Said of course it ain't gonna do for me to stand up here and mention the guy
So I'll refrain from calling that party's name
But you let me catch him cheatin' just once again
And I'm gonna take my fist and I’m gonna close that other eye
Now you see this razor well I had it sharpened just today
Now I'm comin' in here with my rules that everybody must follow when they play
Now Clyde you keep them bony hands up here on top of the table when you're dealin' please
Don't go takin' them little wild aces stickin' em off down there between your knees
And Jesse cut out makin' all them monkey signs you still tryin' to tip off your hand
You better talk to me in American big AA so's I can understand
And Leroy quit takin' em off the bottom of the deck son I tell ya that's rough
This is an army game son take five then halt that's enough
Then pass me them face cards over here let me cut them things every time before you deal
Cause I like to delve in there son I got to see
Cause I got news for you boys you ain't playin this game accordin' to that fella Hoyle there
Uh uh tonight you're playin' this game accordin' to me
Now then seein' as how you all know that I didn't ride in here on a head of cabbage
Henry if you'll break out another deck of them Bicycles me and the boys will get on with the business
But keep your eye on that fella wearin' the patch he holds them cards kinda funny
Ha ha if he ain't careful somebody around this table liable to jack his jaw
Ha ha ha ah son I feel like my luck just changed

===== Jerry Reed - Sixteen Tons =====
Son yeah some people say a man's made outta mud
But a poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood skin and bone a mind
That's weak and a back that's strong
You load sixteen tons what do you get
Another day older and deeper and debt
St Peter don't you call me I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
I owe my soul I owe my soul to the company store
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
Grabbed me a shovel and I went to the mine
Loaded sicteen tons of No 9 coal
And the storeboss said well bless my soul
I load sixteen tons what do you get...
Well I was born one morning it was drizzlin' rain
Figting and trouble is my middle name
I was raised in wood by mama of mine
No hightoned mama makes me walk the line
If you see me comin' better step aside
A lotta men didn't and a lotta men died
One fist is iron the other one's steel
If the right one don't get you then the left one will

===== Jerry Reed - Papa’s Knee =====
Rock-a-bye me old Sunday chair
Sing me a song was a long time back there
I sat on his lap sure felt good to be
Only a child on my papa's knee
Now Papa would sing a little off key
But he'd fill me with feelings of sweet harmony
Now I'd like to hear that old tune again
And rock to and fro in lullaby land
Doo doo doo da loo Papa would moan
Oh it takes me back to my childhood home
Doo doo doo da loo sweet harmony
Only a child on my papa’s knee
Now sometimes alone well I reminisce
Surrender my thoughts about loved ones I miss
I was so young still my memory
Won't let me forget how my papa rocked me

===== Jerry Reed - Ugly Woman =====
I ain't gonna drink no more tobacco I ain't gonna smoke no more moonshine
I'm through lookin' at good lookin' women ain't gonna bother now to waste my time
Ain't gonna drink no more black coffee thinkin' about her till the break of daylight
I'm gonna go out and find me an ugly woman to love
Son I'm a gonna put on my walkin' shoes
I'm gonna walk down the avenues
I'm gonna keep on walkin' till I find an ugly woman to love
I don't care if she's short don't care if she's fat
Just as long as she's good to me that's where it's at
I'm gonna find me an ugly woman to love son
I ain't gonna drink no more tobacco ain't gonna smoke no more moonshine
I'm through gawkin' at good lookin' chicks I ain't gonna bother now to waste my time
Ain't gonna drink no more black coffee and think about her till the break of daylight
Hoss I'm gonna go out and find me an ugly woman to love
Well I'm a gonna put on my walkin' shoes
I'm gonna keep on walkin' till I find me somebody ugly to love
I'm gonna find me an ugly woman to love
Well I'm gonna walk down the avenues I'm a gonna keep on my walkin' shoes
I'm gonna keep on walkin' till I find somebody ugly that I can love

===== Jerry Reed - Smell the Flowers =====
Yesterdays
Oh, how many do you wish you could relive?
Turn the page and go back
Oh, I wonder what you'd give?
Looking back, does it seem
That when you've planned
And when you've dreamed
You forgot the most important thing
Smell the flowers while the roses bloom
Take the time my friend and sing a happy tune
Oh, how precious every mile, so take a minute, learn to smile
My friend, let's stop a while and smell the flowers
Smell the flowers
Got a troubled mind, friend
Did you let too much worry rule your days?
When you look back
Do you feel like something precious slipped away?
Oh, my friend are you the man
That the world slip through your hands?
Can you remember
When you smelled the flowers?
You won't have this day again 'cause every road has got to end
So don't forget my friend to smell the flowers

===== Jerry Reed - Big Daddy =====
Who's that sneakin' down the fire escape
Who's that peekin' through the garden gate
Who's on the loose, but can't be found
Big Daddy's Alabama bound
Police is searchin' but he can't be found
Somebody ran off with the Mayor's wife
Somebody tried to take the Police Chief's life
Somebody stole the Judge's ragged old gown
Big Daddy's Alabamy bound
Highway patrol and the F.B.I
Is out huntin' this criminal
They got their hound dogs sniffin' the ground

===== John Prine - In Spite of Ourselves =====
She don't like her eggs all runny
She thinks crossin' her legs is funny
She looks down her nose at money
She gets it on like the Easter Bunny
She's my baby, I'm her honey
I'm never gonna let her go
He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays
I caught him once and he was sniffin' my undies
He ain't too sharp, but he gets things done
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen
He's my baby and I'm his honey
I'm never gonna let him go
In spite of ourselves, we'll end up a-sittin' on a rainbow
Against all odds, honey, we're the big door prize
We're gonna spite our noses right off of our faces
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts dancin' in our eyes
She thinks all my jokes are corny
Convict movies make her horny
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs
Swears like a sailor when she shaves her legs
She takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'
He's got more balls than a big brass monkey
He's a whacked-out weirdo and a lovebug junkie
Sly as a fox and crazy as a loon
Payday comes and he's howlin' at the moon
He's my baby, I don't mean maybe
Never gonna let him go
In spite of ourselves

===== John Prine - Clay Pigeons =====
I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station, gonna buy a ticket to ride
I'm gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around about two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
Sing this song for the people I meet
And get along with it all
Where the people say "y'all"
Sing a song with a friend
Change the shape that I'm in
And get back in the game
And start playin' again
I'd like to stay, but I might have to go to start over again
I might go back down to Texas or go to somewhere that I've never been
And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
And I won't have to go home
Get used to being alone
Change the words to this song
And start singin' again
I'm tired of runnin' round lookin' for answers to questions that I already know
I could build me a castle with memories just to have somewhere to go
Count the days and the nights that it takes to get back in the saddle again
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day
And start talkin' again when I know what to say
Ride till the sun comes up and down around about two or three times
Sing my song for the people I meet
And start talkin' again
When I know what to say

===== John Prine - Angel from Montgomery =====
I am an old woman named after my mother
My old man is another child that's grown old
If dreams were lightning, and thunder were desire
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
When I was a young girl, well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at, just a free ramblin' man
But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken-down dam
There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say?

===== John Prine - That's the Way That the World Goes 'Round =====
I know a guy that's got a lot to lose
He's a pretty nice fellow, but kind of confused
He's got muscles in his head that ain't never been used
Thinks he own half of this town
Starts drinking heavy, gets a big red nose
Beats his old lady with a rubber hose
Then he takes her out to dinner, buys her new clothes
That's the way that the world goes 'round
You're up one day, the next, you're down
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
I was sitting in the bathtub counting my toes
When the radiator broke, water all froze
I got stuck in the ice without my clothes
Naked as the eyes of a clown
I was crying ice cubes, hoping I'd croak
When the sun come through the window, the ice all broke
I stood up and laughed, thought it was a joke

===== John Prine - Summer's End =====
Summer's end is around the bend just flyin'
The swimmin' suits are on the line just dryin'
I'll meet you there per our conversation
I hope I didn't ruin your whole vacation
Well you never know how far from home you're feelin'
Until you've watched the shadows cross the ceilin'
Well I don't know, but I can see it snowin'
In your car, the windows are wide open
Just come on home
Come on home
No you don't have to be alone
Valentines break hearts and minds at random
That old Easter egg ain't got a leg to stand on
Well I can see that you can't win for tryin'
And New Year's Eve is bound to leave you cryin'
The moon and stars hang out in bars just talkin'
I still love that picture of us walkin'
Just like that old house we thought was haunted
Summer's end came faster than we wanted
You don’t have to be alone

===== John Prine - Spanish Pipedream =====
She was a level-headed dancer
On the road to alcohol
And I was just a soldier
On my way to Montreal
Well she pressed her chest against me
About the time the jukebox broke
Yeah, she give me a peck on the back of the neck
And these are the words she spoke
Blow up your TV, throw away your paper
Go to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try and find Jesus on your own
Well, I sat there at the table
And I acted real naïve
For I knew that topless lady
Had something up her sleeve
Well, she danced around the bar room
And she did the hoochy-coo
Yeah she sang her song all night long
Telling me what to do
Well, I was young and hungry
And about to leave that place
When just as I was leaving
Well she looked me in the face
I said, "You must know the answer"
She said, "No but I'll give it a try"
And to this very day we've been living our way
Here is the reason why
We blew up our TV, threw away our paper
Went to the country, built us a home
Had a lot of children, fed 'em on peaches
They all found Jesus on their own

===== John Prine - Sweet Revenge =====
I got kicked off of Noah's Ark, I turn my cheek to unkind remarks
There was two of everything, but one of me
And when the rains came tumbling down, I held my breath and I stood my ground
And I watched that ship go sailing out to sea
Take it back, take it back, oh no, you can't say that
All of my friends are not dead or in jail
Through rock and through stone, the black wind still moans
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge without fail
I caught an aisle seat on a plane and drove an English teacher half insane
Making up jokes about bicycle spokes and red balloons
So I called up my local DJ  and he didn't have a lot to say
'Cause the radio has learned all of my favorite tunes
The white meat is on the run and the dark meat is far too done
And the milkman left me a note yesterday
Get out of this town by noon, you're coming on way too soon
And besides that, we never liked you any way
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge will prevail without fail

===== John Prine - Fish and Whistle =====
I been thinking lately about the people I meet
The carwash on the corner and the hole in the street
The way my ankles hurt with shoes on my feet
And I'm wondering if I'm gonna see tomorrow
Father, forgive us for what we must do
You forgive us we'll forgive you
We'll forgive each other till we both turn blue
Then we'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
I was in the army, but I never dug a trench
I used to bust my knuckles on a monkey wrench
I'd go to town and drink and give the girls a pinch
But I don't think they ever even noticed me
You forgive us, we'll forgive you
Fish and whistle, whistle and fish
Eat everything that they put on your dish
And when we get through, we'll make a big wish
That we never have to do this again again again
On my very first job, I said thank you and please
They made me scrub a parking lot down on my knees
Then I got fired for being scared of bees
And they only give me fifty cents an hour
We'll whistle and go fishing in heaven

===== John Prine - Paradise =====
When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn
And Daddy, won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County?
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man
When I die, let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester Dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am

===== John Prine - Hello in There =====
We had an apartment in the city
Me and Loretta liked living there
Well, it'd been years since the kids had grown
A life of their own left us alone
John and Linda live in Omaha
And Joe is somewhere on the road
We lost Davy in the Korean War
And I still don't know what for, don't matter anymore
You know that old trees just grow stronger
And old rivers grow wilder every day
Old people just grow lonesome
Waiting for someone to say, "Hello in there, hello"
Me and Loretta, we don't talk much more
She sits and stares through the backdoor screen
And all the news just repeats itself
Like some forgotten dream that we've both seen
Someday I'll go and call up Rudy
We worked together at the factory
But what could I say if he asks "What's new?"
"Nothing, what's with you? Nothing much to do"
So if you're walking down the street sometime
And spot some hollow ancient eyes
Please don't just pass 'em by and stare as if you didn't care
Say, "Hello in there, hello"

===== John Prine - Illegal Smile =====
When I woke up this morning, things were looking bad
Seemed like total silence was the only friend I had
A bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down and won
And it was twelve o'clock before I realized that I was having no fun
Ah, but fortunately I have the key to escape reality
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone
No, I'm just trying to have me some fun
Last time I checked my bankroll, it was getting thin
Sometimes it seems like the bottom is the only place I've been
Chased a rainbow down a one-way street, dead end
And all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen
Well, I sat down in my closet with all my overalls
Trying to get away from all the ears inside my walls
I dreamed the police heard everything I thought, what then?
Well, I went to court and the judge's name was Hoffman
Well done
Hot dog bun
My sister's a nun

===== John Prine - I Remember Everything =====
I've been down this road before, I remember every tree
Every single blade of grass, holds a special place for me
And I remember every town, every hotel room
Every song I ever sang on a guitar out of tune
I remember everything, things I can't forget
The way you turned and smiled on me on the night that we first met
And I remember every night your ocean eyes of blue
I miss you in the morning light like roses miss the dew
I've been down this road before alone as I can be
Careful not to let my past go sneakin' up on me
Got no future in my happiness, the regrets are very few
Sometimes a little tenderness was the best that I could do
Swimin' pools of butterflies would slip right through the net

===== John Prine - Long Monday =====
You and me, sittin' in the back of my memory
Like a honeybee buzzing around a glass of sweet Chablis
Radio's on, windows rolled up and my mind's rolled down
Headlights shining like silver moons rollin' on the ground
We made love in every way love can be made
And we made time look like time could never fade
Friday night, we both made the guitar hum
Saturday made Sunday feel like it would never come
Gonna be a long Monday
Sittin' all alone on a mountain by a river that has no end
Stuck like the tick of a clock that's come unwound again
Soul to soul, heart to heart, and cheek to cheek
Now come on, baby, give me a kiss that'll last all week
The thought of you leavin' again brings me down
The promise of your sweet love brings me around
It's gonna be a long Monday
Stuck like the tick of a clock that's come unwound again and again

===== John Prine - I Just Called to Say I Love You =====
No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No First of Spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is is something new
Made up of these three words I say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

===== John Prine - Knockin' on Your Screen Door =====
I ain't got nobody hangin' round my doorstep
Ain't got no loose change just a-hangin' round my jeans
If you see somebody, would you send 'em over my way?
I could use some help here with a can of pork and beans
I once had a family, but they up and left me
With nothing but an 8-track, Another Side of George Jones
I was in high cotton just a-bangin' on my six-string
A-kickin' at the trash can, walkin' skin and bone
I can see your back porch, if I close my eyes now
I can hear the train tracks through the laundry on the line
I'm thinking it's your business, but you don't got to answer
I'm knockin' on your screen door in the summertime
Everybody's out there climbin' on the trees now
Swingin' in the breeze now, hanging on the vine
I'm dreamin' about a sailboat, I don't need a fur coat
Underneath the dashboard got some sweet potato wine

===== John Prine - Souvenirs =====
All the snow has turned to water
Christmas days have come and gone
Broken toys and faded colors
Are all that's left to linger on
I hate graveyards and old pawn shops
For they always bring me tears
I can't forgive the way they rob me
Of my childhood souvenirs
Memories, they can't be boughten
They can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get those souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me
Broken hearts and dirty windows
Make life difficult to see
That's why last night and this mornin'
Always look the same to me
I hate reading old love letters
Of my sweetheart's souvenirs

===== John Prine - Sam Stone =====
Sam Stone came home to his wife and family
After serving in the conflict overseas
And the time that he served had shattered all his nerves
And left a little shrapnel in his knee
But the morphine eased the pain and the grass grew 'round his brain
And gave him all the confidence he lacked
With a Purple Heart and a monkey on his back
There's a hole in Daddy's arm where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothin',I suppose
Little pitchers have big ears, don't stop to count the years
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios
Mmm hmm hmm hmm
Sam Stone's welcome home didn't last too long
He went to work when he'd spent his last dime
And Sammy took to stealing when he got that empty feeling
For a hundred dollar habit without overtime
And the gold rolled through his veins like a thousand railroad trains
And eased his mind in the hours that he chose
While the kids ran around wearin' other people's clothes
Jesus Christ died for nothin', I suppose
Sam Stone was alone when he popped his last balloon
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair
Well, he played his last request while the room smelled just like death
With an overdose hovering in the air
But life had lost its fun and there was nothing to be done
But trade his house that he bought on the G.I. Bill
For a flag draped casket on a local heroes' hill

===== John Prine - Pretty Good =====
I got a friend in Fremont
He sells used cars, you know
Well, he calls me up twice a year
Just to ask me, "How'd it go?"
"Pretty good
Not bad
I can't complain
But actually, everything is just about the same"
I met a girl from Venus
Her insides were lined in gold
Well, she did what she did, said "How was it, kid?"
She was politely told
Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy has ever seen
Molly went to Arkansas
She got raped by Dobbin's dog
Well, she was doing good 'til she went in the woods
And got pinned up against a log
Pretty good
She can't complain
'Cause actually, all them dogs are just about the same
I heard Allah and Buddha
Were singing at the Savior's feast
And up in the sky an Arabian rabbi
Fed Quaker oats to a priest
They can't complain
'Cause actually, all them gods are just about the same
'Cause actually, everything is just about the same

===== John Prine - When I Get to Heaven =====
When I get to heaven, I'm gonna shake God's hand
Thank Him for more blessings than one man can stand
Then I'm gonna get a guitar and start a rock and roll band
Check into a swell hotel; ain't the afterlife grand?
And then I'm gonna get a cocktail, vodka and ginger ale
Yeah, I'm gonna smoke a cigarette that's nine miles long
I'm gonna kiss that pretty girl on the Tilt-a-whirl
'Cause this old man is goin' to town
Then as God as my witness, I'm gettin' back into show business
I'm gonna open up a nightclub called The Tree of Forgiveness
And forgive everybody ever done me any harm
Why, I might even invite a few choice critics, those syphilitic parasitics
Buy 'em a pint of Smithwick's and smother 'em with my charm
'Cause then I'm gonna get a cocktail, vodka and ginger ale
Yeah I'm gonna smoke a cigarette that's nine miles long
Yeah this old man is goin' to town
When I get to heaven, I'm gonna take that wristwatch off my arm
What are you gonna do with time after you've bought the farm?
And then I'm gonna go find my mom and dad and good old brother Doug
Why, I bet him and cousin Jackie are still cuttin' up a rug
I wanna see all my mama's sisters 'cause that's where all the love starts
I miss them all like crazy, bless their little hearts
And I always will remember these words my daddy said
He said, "Buddy, when you're dead, you're a dead peckerhead"
I hope to prove him wrong, that is, when I get to heaven
'Cause I'm gonna have a cocktail, vodka and ginger ale

===== John Prine - Speed of the Sound of Loneliness =====
You come home late and you come home early
You come on big when you're feeling small
You come home straight and you come home curly
Sometimes you don't come home at all
So what in the world's come over you
And what in heaven's name have you done
You've broken the speed of the sound of loneliness
You're out there running just to be on the run
Well I got a heart that burns with a fever
And I got a worried and a jealous mind
How can a love that'll last forever
Get left so far behind
It's a mighty mean and a dreadful sorrow
It's crossed the evil line today
Well, how can you ask about tomorrow
We ain't got one word to say

===== Gram Parsons - Return of the Grievous Angel =====
Won't you scratch my itch sweet Annie Rich and welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or step into your parlour and I'll tell you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
Oh, and I remembered something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all led me straight back home to you
'Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
We flew straight across that river bridge, last night half past two
The switchman waved his lantern goodbye and good day as we went rolling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the Grievous Angel
And now I know just what I have to do
(Pick it for me, James)
And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that I've never been shown
The news I could bring I met up with the king on his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old Bible belt and lighted out for some desert town
Oh, but I remembered something you once told me

===== Gram Parsons - Hickory Wind =====
In South Carolina there are many tall pines
I remember the oak tree that we used to climb
But now when I'm lonesome, I always pretend
That I'm getting the feel of hickory wind
I started out younger at most everything
All the riches and pleasures, what else could life bring?
But it makes me feel better each time it begins
Callin' me home, hickory wind
It's a hard way to find out that trouble is real
In a far away city, with a far away feel
Keeps callin' me home, hickory wind

===== Gram Parsons - In My Hour of Darkness =====
In my hour of darkness
In my time of need
Oh Lord, grant me vision
Oh Lord, grant me speed
Once I knew a young man
Went driving through the night
Miles and miles without a word
With just his high-beam lights
Who'd have ever thought
They'd build such a deadly Denver bend
To be so strong, to take so long
As it would 'til the end
Oh, Lord, grant me speed
Another young man safely strummed
His silver string guitar
And he played to people everywhere
Some say he was a star
But he was just a country boy
His simple songs confess
And the music he had in him
So very few possess
In my time of need (Oh)
Then there was an old man
Kind and wise with age
And he read me just like a book
And he never missed a page
And I loved him like my father
And I loved him like my friend
And I knew his time would shortly come
But I did not know just when

===== Gram Parsons - A Song for You =====
Oh, my land is like a wild goose
Wanders all around, everywhere
Trembles and it shakes till every tree is loose
It rolls the meadows and it rolls the nails
So take me down to your dance floor
And I won't mind people when they stare
Paint a different color on your front door
And tomorrow, we will still be there
Jesus built a ship to sing a song to
It sails the river and it sails the tide
Some of my friends don't know who they belong to
Some can't get a single thing to work inside
And I won't mind the people when they stare
I've loved you every day and now I'm leaving
And I can see the sorrow in your eyes
I hope you know a lot more than you're believing
Just so the sun don't hurt you when you cry
Oh, take me down to your dance floor
I won't mind the people when they stare
And tomorrow, we may still be there

===== Gram Parsons - She =====
She
She came from the land of the cotton
A land that was nearly forgotten by everyone
She worked and she slaved so hard
A big old field was her back yard in the delta sun
Oh, but she sure could sing
Oh, she sure could sing
Then he
Looked down and he took a little pity
The whole town swore he decided he'd help her some
But he
Didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty
And deep inside his heart, he knew she was the only one
Yeah, she sure could sing
She had faith, she had believing
She led all the people together in singing
And she prays every night to the Lord up above
Singing hallelujah, hallelujah
They
Used to walk, singing songs by the river
Even when she knew for sure she had to go away
Never knew what her life was to give her
And never had to worry about it for one single day
Oh my, but she sure could sing
Oh yes, she sure could sing
My, my, my, she sure could sing
Oh yeah, she sure could sing
Oh, and she sure could sing

===== Gram Parsons - We’ll Sweep Out the Ashes in the Morning =====
We know it's wrong to let this fire burn between us
We've got to stop this wild desire in you and in me
So we'll let the flame burn once again until the thrill is gone
Then we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
We're two people caught up in a flame that has to die down soon
I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you
So tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
Each time we meet we both agree it's for the last time
But out of your arms I'm out of my mind
So we'll taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning
Yes we'll taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning
Then we'll sweep out the ashes
We'll sweep out the ashes
We'll sweep out the ashes in the morning

===== Gram Parsons - Brass Buttons =====
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottled blues
And the tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair
My mind was young until she grew
My secret thoughts known only by the few
It was a dream much to real to be leaned against too long
All the time I think she knew
Her words still dance inside my head
Her comb still lies beside my bed
And the sun comes up without her, it just doesn't know she's gone
Oh, but I remember everything she said

===== Gram Parsons - Hearts on Fire =====
Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free
One short year our love had burned
Until at last I guess you learned
The art of being untrue and then goodbye
What could I do except to cry and moan
Lord, what have I done
Once we were as sweet and warm
As the golden morning sun
Friends say it's just a game
And that no one is to blame
Go out forget her lies
But she'll be there and sparks will fly
My love has turned to hatred
Sleep escapes me still
God, please take this heart of mine
'cause if you don't the devil will

===== Gram Parsons - The New Soft Shoe =====
It was forty or fifty years ago
A big shot played with time
Mister Walker held the dough
And both kept Cord in line
Watched and checked on every single day
Building his own special cars
His very special way
Ooh! The new soft shoe
And then walking through a southern mall
I saw a shoeshine stand
A man was talking to a crowd
Holding slippers in his hands
Don't you know the same thing happens
Each and every day?
Did you ever hear a song
That's hard to even play?
Then a color TV broadcast
Snuck from New Orleans
Showed me one more man who spoke
And wore bright blue and green
When you saw him talk his way
Was when he showed his claws
And spoke to people every day
Just to get applause
Ooh! The new soft shoe .....

===== Gram Parsons - That’s All It Took =====
That's all it took
The mention of your name
And all my love for you
Burst into flame
I tried so hard
To let you go, but look
How I still tremble at your name
To make me know that I still care
It seems my heart just can't give up
The dreams we used to share
I tell my friends I'm happy
But they read me like a book
And when today I heard them say
Your name that's all it took
That s all it took to make me yearn for your embrace
I guess I might as well admit
No one can take your place
I fell for you completely
Sinker line and hook

===== Gram Parsons - Sin City =====
This old town is filled with sin
It'll swallow you in
If you've got some money to burn
Take it home right away
You've got three years to pay
But Satan is waiting his turn
This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poor house
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty-first floor your gold plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain
The scientists say
It'll all wash away
But we don't believe any more
Cause we've got our recruits
And our green mohair suits
So please show you ID At the door
A friend came around
Tried to clean up this town
His ideas made some people mad
But he trusted his crowd
So he spoke right out loud
And they lost the best friend they had

===== Gram Parsons - Kiss the Children =====
Well, it's said my life has been so free and easy
But I'll tell you now the story isn't so
'Cause I've spent a lot of time down on the corner
Tasting tears and spilling whiskey on the floor
Such a shame that it's so hard for me
To tell the truth to you
But by now you know the kind of man I am
So don't turn your pretty face away from me, dear
'Cause there's kids in this game, don't understand
One more night like this would put me six feet under
But my heart will still be fighting for your love
Just remember, little darling, that I love you
And kiss the children for me, please, before you go
So don't play this crazy game with me no longer
'Cause I won't be able to resist my rage
And the gun that's hanging on the kitchen wall, dear
Is like the road sign pointing straight to satan's cage

===== Gram Parsons - How Much I’ve Lied =====
Darling, there is something I must tell you, you must know
But it's so hard to say the words I feel
This fancy that I'm on has been going on too long
It's time we stopped pretending things are real
'Cause I've been living deep in sin, I've been living blind
And I don't know just what's right or wrong
To take a chance on losing you was such a silly thing to do
The chance I might wake up and find you gone
Blue, so blue, my love is burning blue
Any brighter flame would be a lie
Blue, so blue, my love still burns for you
But I know that I'll only make you cry
A thief can only steal from you, he cannot break your heart
He'll never touch the precious things inside
So one like you should surely be miles and miles away from me
Then you'd never care how much I've lied
So try to understand the pain
It takes so long when I explain
Please, don't you forget how much I've lied

===== Gram Parsons - Big Mouth Blues =====
Oh, well, I was born in a little bitty tar hut
And they called me a man 'cause I couldn't
Keep my big, big mouth shut
So what's the sense of me sitting here leaving
When any ole day I might be even
And Lord knows that New York City's got
A lot to do with it
I wish someday I could find the way
To get it out of my grain
This dirty old town's gonna sink right down
And I don't want to go with it
Well I wish there was a way that
I knew to get even
A way to get a lick in
A 'bobbin' and a 'weavin'
Any ole thing besides goin' and a'leavin'
You can do on a train
Well, I once knew a man who sailed around
The world twice
He would have made it three but he took
A lot of bad advice
So you just tell me what's the sense of me
Sittin' here leavin'
When any ole day I might get even
And Lord knows New York City's got
Alot to do with it
I wish someday I could find a way to get it out
Of my brain
I wish there was a way that I knew to get even
Way to get a lick in
A 'bobbin' and a'weavin'
Oh, yes!
But his motor cooled down and now he's
Deliverin' ice
Tell me what's the sense of him
When any ole day he might get even
I wish someday he could find a way to get it out
Of his brain
A 'bobbin and a'weavin'
And all the things besides goin' and a'leavin'
Oh, yeah

===== Gram Parsons - I Can’t Dance =====
I can't dance, I never could
I guess my feet don't match
I'd get out there on the floor
But I'm afraid of hurtin' my back
I can't dance
I guess I'm just one of the unfortunate few
So just for a little bit, baby, I'll come out and dance with you
But I can't dance and I'm feelin' so good, yeah
Some of us can, some of us can't
Some of us wish that they could dance
I can't dance and I'm feelin' so good, yeah
Yeah, just for a little bit, baby, I'll come out and dance with you

===== Gram Parsons - Candy Man =====
Come on babe, let me take you by the hand
Can't you see, you're for me
All your own candy candy, candy man
Come on babe, I love your honey lovin' ways
Oh sweet thing, I love your honey lovin', a honey lovin' ways
You're for me, let me be
Come on babe, gonna treat you right
Give you candy kisses, every single night
Candy candy, candy candy, candy man
Can't you see. you're for me
All your own, candy candy, candy man
Candy man, candy man
Candy man

===== Gram Parsons - They Still Go Down =====
My daddy was a miner
Granddaddy was too
My uncle died in a rock slide
Before the rescue team got through
And they still go down
Into the earth
And then inside all covered with dirt
Down in old wide Utah
Back to Coal Creek, Tennessee
Many a man lyin' dead now
But you got to have those medals, you see
Maybe they’ll find a new way to mine
You won't have to go in the ground
But there're thousands with spots on their lungs now
Who still watch their lives trickle down

===== Gram Parsons - We’ll Sweep Out The Ashes In The Mornin =====
We know it's wrong to let this fire burn between us
We've got to stop this wild desire in you and in me
So we'll let the flame burn once again until the thrill is gone
Then we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
We're two people caught up in the flame that has to die out soon
I didn't mean to start this fire and neither did you
So tonight when you hold me tight we'll let the fire burn on
And we'll sweep out the ashes in the morning
Each time when we meet we both agree that it's for the last time
But out of your arms I'm out of my mind
So we'll taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning
Yes we'll taste the thrill of stolen love tonight until the dawning
And we'll sweep out the ashes
We'll sweep out the ashes
We'll sweep out the ashes in the morning

===== Gram Parsons - Pride of Man =====
Turn around go back down go back the way you came
Can't you see the flash of fire ten times brighter than the day
And behold the mighty city broken in the dust again
Oh God the pride of man, broken in the dust again
Babylon is laid to waste Egypt's buried in her shame
Their mighty men are beaten down the kings are fallen in the ways
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again
Terror is on everyside though the leaders are dismayed
Those who put their faith in fire in fire their faith shall be repaid
Shout a warning to the nations that the sword of god is raised
On Babylon that mighty city rich in treasure wide in fame
It shall cause thy towers to fall and make it be a pyre of flame
Thou that dwell on many water rich in treasure wide in fame
Bow unto a god of gold thy pride of might shall be thy shame
And only God can lead the people back into the faith again
Thy holy mountain be restored thy mercy on thy people Lord

===== Gram Parsons - Dark End Of The Street =====
At the dark end of the street
That's where we'll always meet
Hiding in shadows
Where we don't belong
Living in darkness
To hide our wrong
You and me
I know that time's gonna take its toll
We'll have to pay for the love that we stole
Cause it's a sin and we know that we're wrong
Oh, but our love keeps coming on strong
They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us someday
We'll steal away
To the dark end of the street
If you take a walk downtown
And find some time to look around
If you should see me, and I walk on by
Oh, darling, please don't cry
Tonight we'll meet

===== Hank Snow - The Wreck of the Old 97 =====
They give him his orders at Monroe, Virginia
Sayin', "Steve, you're way behind time
This is not 38, but it's Old 97
You must put her in Spencer on time."
Then he look around and said to his black, greasy fireman
"Just shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Oak Mountain
You can watch Old 97 roll."
It's a mighty rough road from Lynchburg to Danville
In a line on a three-mile grade
It was on that grade that he lost his airbrakes
Oh, you see what a jump he made
He was goin' down grade making 90 miles an hour
When his whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
And was scalded to death by the steam
Now ladies, you must take warning
From this time on and learn
Never speak harsh words to your true love or husband
He may leave you and never return

===== Hank Snow - I’m Movin’ On =====
That big eight wheeler rollin' down the track
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause I'm movin' on
I'll soon be gone
You were flyin' too high for my little old sky
So I'm movin' on
That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
Said hello to the Southland, we're comin' to you
And we're movin' on
Oh hear my song
You had the laugh on me, so I've set you free
And I'm movin' on
Mister Fireman, won't you please listen to me
'Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on
Keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
And keep movin' me on
Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
To keep movin' me on
You're gonna ease my mind, put me there on time
And keep rollin' on
I've told you baby from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
Now I'm movin' on
I'm rollin' on
You've broken your vow and it's all over now
You switched your engine, now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
You done your daddy wrong
I've warned you twice, now you can settle the price
But someday baby when you've had your play
You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep movin' on
You stayed away too long
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue

===== Hank Snow - He’ll Understand and Say Well Done =====
If when you give the best of your service
Telling the world that the Saviour has come
Be not dismayed when men don't believe you
He'll understand and say well done
Misunderstood the Saviour of sinners
Hung on the cross He was God's only son
Oh, hear Him calling His Father in Heaven
Let not my will, but Thine be done
Chorus
Oh when I come to the end of my journey
Weary of life and the battle is won
Carrying the staff and the cross of redemption
If when this life of labor is ended
And the reward of the race you have run
Oh the sweet rest that's prepared for the faithful
Will be his blest and final "Well done"
But if you try and fail in your trying
Hands sore and scarred from the work you've begun
Take up your cross and run quickly to meet Him
He'll understand, "He'll say. "Well done."

===== Hank Snow - I’ve Been Everywhere =====
I was totin' my pack along a dusty Winnemucca road
When along came a semi with high and canvas covered load
If you're going to Winnemucca Mack, with me, you can ride
So I climbed into the cab, and then I settled down inside
He asked me if I've seen a road with so much dust and sand
And I said, "Listen, bud, I've travelled every road in this here land."
I've been everywhere man
I've been everywhere, man
Across the deserts bare, man
I've breathed the mountain air, man
Of travel, I've had my share, man
I've been everywhere
I've been to Reno, Chicago, Fargo, Minnesota, Buffalo, Toronto, Winslow, Sarasota
Wichita, Tulsa, Ottawa, Oklahoma, Tampa, Panama, Mattawa, La Paloma
Bangor, Baltimore, Salvador, Amarillo, Tocopilla, Barranquilla, and Padilla, I'm a killer
Boston, Charleston, Dayton, Louisiana, Washington, Houston, Kingston, Texarkana
Monterey, Ferriday, Santa Fe, Tallapoosa, Glen Rock, Black Rock, Little Rock, Oskaloosa
Tennessee, Hennessey, Chicopee Spirit Lake
Grand Lake, Devil's Lake, Crater Lake, for Pete's sake
Louisville, Nashville, Knoxville, Ombabika, Schefferville, Jacksonville, Waterville, Costa Rica
Pittsfield, Springfield, Bakersfield, Shreveport, Hackensack, Cadillac, Fond du Lac, Davenport
Idaho, Jellicoe, Argentina, Diamantina, Pasadena, Catalina, see what I mean-a
Pittsburgh, Parkersburg, Gravelbourg, Colorado, Ellensburg, Rexburg, Vicksburg, El Dorado
Larimore, Atmore, Haverstraw, Chatanika, Chaska, Nebraska, Alaska, Opelika
Baraboo, Waterloo, Kalamazoo, Kansas City, Sioux City, Cedar City, Dodge City, what a pity
(I know some place you haven't been)

===== Hank Snow - (Now and Then, There’s) A Fool Such As I =====
Pardon me, if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye
Don't be angry with me should I cry
When you're gone, yet I'll dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I'm a fool, but I'll love you, dear, until the day I die

===== Hank Snow - Nobody’s Child =====
I was slowly passing an orphan's home one day
And stopped there for a moment, just to watch the children play
Alone a boy was standing and when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see and he began to cry
I'm nobody's child I'm nobody's child
I'm like a flower just growing wild
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smiles
Nobody wants me I'm nobody's child
People come for children and take them for their own
But they all seem to pass me by and I am left alone
I know they'd like to take me but when they see I'm blind
They always take some other child and I am left behind
No mother's arms to hold me or soothe me when I cry
Sometimes it gets so lonely here I wish that I could die
I'd walk the streets of heaven where all the blind can see
And just like all the other kids there'd be a home for me
I just can't seem to figure out why the folks all pass me by
Cause I know that it's true that God takes little blind children with him in the sky
And they tell me that I'm oh so pretty and they seem to like my big curls of gold
But then they take some other little child and I'm left here all alone

===== Hank Snow - A Daisy a Day =====
He remembers the first time he met her
He remembered the first thing she said
He remembered the first time he held her
And the night that she came to his bed
He remembers her sweet way of saying
Honey has something gone wrong
He remembered the fun and the teasing
And the reason he wrote her this song
I'll give you a daisy a day dear
I'll give you a daisy a day
I'll love you until the rivers run still
And the four winds we know blow away
They would walk down the street in the evening
And for years I would see them go by
And their love that was more than the clothes that they wore
Could be seen in the gleam in their eyes
As a kid they would take me for candy
And I'd love to go tagging along
We'd hold hands while we walked the corner
And the old man would sing her this song
Now he walks down the street in the evening
And he stops by the old candy store
And I somehow believe he's believing
He's holding her hand like before
For he feels all her love walking with him
And he smiles at the things she might say
Then the old man walks up to the hill top
And gives her a daisy a day

===== Hank Snow - Dangerous Dan McGrew =====
A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute saloon;
The kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time tune;
Back of the bar, in a solo game, sat Dangerous Dan McGrew
And watching his luck was his light-o'-love, the lady that's known as Lou
When out of the night, which was fifty below, and into the din and the glare
There stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks, dog-dirty, and loaded for bear
He looked like a man with a foot in the grave and scarcely the strength of a louse
Yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar, and he called for drinks for the house
There was none could place the stranger's face, though we searched ourselves for a clue;
But we drank his health, and the last to drink was Dangerous Dan McGrew
There's men that somehow just grip your eyes, and hold them hard like a spell;
And such was he, and he looked to me like a man who had lived in hell;
With a face most hair, and the dreary stare of a dog whose day is done
As he watered the green stuff in his glass, and the drops fell one by one
Then I got to figgering who he was, and wondering what he'd do
And I turned my head—and there watching him was the lady that's known as Lou
His eyes went rubbering round the room, and he seemed in a kind of daze
Till at last that old piano fell in the way of his wandering gaze
The rag-time kid was having a drink; there was no one else on the stool
So the stranger stumbles across the room, and flops down there like a fool
In a buckskin shirt that was glazed with dirt he sat, and I saw him sway;
Then he clutched the keys with his talon hands—my God! but that man could play
Were you ever out in the Great Alone, when the moon was awful clear
And the icy mountains hemmed you in with a silence you most could hear;
With only the howl of a timber wolf, and you camped there in the cold
A half-dead thing in a stark, dead world, clean mad for the muck called gold;
While high overhead, green, yellow and red, the North Lights swept in bars?—
Then you've a haunch what the music meant . . . hunger and night and the stars
And hunger not of the belly kind, that's banished with bacon and beans
But the gnawing hunger of lonely men for a home and all that it means;
For a fireside far from the cares that are, four walls and a roof above;
But oh! so cramful of cosy joy, and crowned with a woman's love—
A woman dearer than all the world, and true as Heaven is true—
(God! how ghastly she looks through her rouge,—the lady that's known as Lou.)
Then on a sudden the music changed, so soft that you scarce could hear;
But you felt that your life had been looted clean of all that it once held dear;
That someone had stolen the woman you loved; that her love was a devil's lie;
That your guts were gone, and the best for you was to crawl away and die
'Twas the crowning cry of a heart's despair, and it thrilled you through and through—
"I guess I'll make it a spread misere," said Dangerous Dan McGrew
The music almost died away . . . then it burst like a pent-up flood;
And it seemed to say, "Repay, repay," and my eyes were blind with blood
The thought came back of an ancient wrong, and it stung like a frozen lash
And the lust awoke to kill, to kill . . . then the music stopped with a crash
And the stranger turned, and his eyes they burned in a most peculiar way;
Then his lips went in in a kind of grin, and he spoke, and his voice was calm
And "Boys," says he, "you don't know me, and none of you care a damn;
But I want to state, and my words are straight, and I'll bet my poke they're true
That one of you is a hound of hell . . . and that one is Dan McGrew."
Then I ducked my head, and the lights went out, and two guns blazed in the dark
And a woman screamed, and the lights went up, and two men lay stiff and stark
Pitched on his head, and pumped full of lead, was Dangerous Dan MGrew
While the man from the creeks lay clutched to the breast of the lady that's known as Lou
These are the simple facts of the case, and I guess I ought to know
They say that the stranger was crazed with "hooch," and I'm not denying it's so
I'm not so wise as the lawyer guys, but strictly between us two—
The woman that kissed him and—pinched his poke—was the lady that's known as Lou

===== Hank Snow - Hello Love =====
Well look who's coming through the door
I think we've met somewhere before
Hello love, hello love
Where in the world have you been so long
I've missed you so since you've been gone
Make yourself feel right at home
I hope you plan on staying long
Come in love, come in love
I must say I was sure surprised
You're the last thing I expected by
I've heard it said time and again
You often go back where you've been
I really didn't believe it was true
But I left the door unlocked for you
I'll try to please you in every way
Assure you of a pleasant stay
This time love, this time love
I've been so blue since you've been gone
Now you're back with me and nothing's wrong
It's wonderful now you're back with me
And things are like they used to be
Remember love, remember love
You're back with me now and my world's complete
So don't mind me if I repeat
Hello love, hello love, hello love, hello love

===== Hank Snow - The Night I Stole Old Sammy Morgan’s Gin =====
Listen folks and I will tell a funny story
You may think it sad but I was in my glory
'Twas a cellar I crept in, cobwebs brushing by my chin
On the night I stole old Sammy Morgan's gin
As my hand fell on the jug I had to snicker
But when I started for the door I went much quicker
For just up above my head someone jumped right out of bed
As I left that cellar believe me, I was liftin'
And the hops from one arm to the other shiftin'
Then I stopped and hauled the plug, sat there till I drained the jug
Had my mind all set, no spare drops I was missin'
Then on my feet I thought I was, but wasn't
And for roads, I guess I saw about a dozen
When I reached the old porch door I went smack-o on the floor
I just made one step and landed in the coal box
Then from off the mantle came a Big Ben 'larm clock
But I finally got upstairs after passing seven bears
'Twas the night I stole old Sammy Morgan's gin
By my bedroom door an owl stood taking tickets
Then the monkey stood before me baking biscuits
But the funniest sight of all was two roosters playing ball
I saw mice as big as horses washing dishes
As an ape came in the door dressed up in britches
Then the floor fell on my head as I tried to get in bed
Well, I woke next morning guess 'twas closer ev'nin'
And my room was certainly in an awful shape
Someone else had took my head and left an elephant's there instead
On the morning after drinking Sammy's gin

===== Hank Snow - I See Jesus =====
Once a man named Steven preached about the Lord
Folks were saved and folks were healed as they heard His Word
Satan did not like it soon he had his crowd
And as he was tried they heard Steven cry aloud
I see Jesus standing at the Father's right hand
I see Jesus over in the Promised Land
Work is over now I'm coming to thee
I see Jesus standing waiting for me
As the stones fell on him beating out his life
Steven knew he'd soon be through with all toil and strife
So much like a Master with a heart so true
He prayed Lord forgive them for they know not what they do
Through the gates of glory down the streets of gold
Marched the hero of the Lord into heaven's fold
When he met the Saviour at the great white throne
I believed he smiled and said "Steven welcome home"
I see Jesus standing at the Father's right hand
Work is over now I'm coming to Thee

===== Hank Snow - Squid Jiggin’ Ground =====
Words & Music by Arthur R. Scammell
Recorded by Hank Snow
Oh this is the place where the fishermen gather
Oil-skins and boots and the Cape hands batten down;
All sizes of figures with squid lines and jiggers
They congregate here on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
Some are workin' their jiggers, while others are yarnin'
There's some standin' up and there's more lyin' down;
While all kinds of fun, jokes and drinks are begun
As they wait for the squid on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
There's men of all ages and boys in the bargain
There's old Billy Cave and there's young Raymond Brown;
There's Rip, Red and Gory out here in the dory
A runnin' down squires on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
There's men from the harbor, there's men from the tickle
And all kinds of motor-boats, green, gray and brown;
Right yonder is Bobby and with him is Nobby
He's chawin' hard tack on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
God bless my soul, list to, there's Skipper John Champy
He's the best hand at squid jiggin' here, I'll be bound;
Hello, what's the row? Why he's jiggin' one now
The very first squid on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
The man with the whiskers is old Jacob Steele
He's gettin' well on, but he's still pretty sound;
While Uncle Bob Hockins wears six pairs of stockin's
Whenever he's out on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
Holy Smoke! What a scuffle! All hands are excited
It's a wonder to me that there's nobody drowned;
There's a bustle, confusion, the wonderful hustle
They're all jiggin' squid on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
Says Barney, "The squids are on top of the water
I just felt me jiggers jig five fathoms down
But a squid in the boat squirted right down his throat
Now he's swearin'like mad on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
There's poor Uncle Louie, his whiskers are spattered
With spots of the squid juice that's flyin' around;
One poor little guy got it right in the eye
But they don't give a darn on the Squid Jiggin' Ground
Now, if you ever feel inclined to go squiddin'
Leave your white clothes behind in the town;
And if you get cranky without your silk hanky
You'd better steer clear of the Squid Jiggin' Ground

===== Hank Snow - The Golden Rocket =====
From old Montana down to Alabam'
I've been before and I'll travel again
You triflin' women can't keep a good man down
You dealt the cards but you missed a play
So hit the road and be on your way
Gonna board the Golden Rocket and leave this town
I was a good engine a runnin' on time
But baby I'm switchin' to another line
So honey never hang your signal out for me
I'm tired of runnin' on the same old track
Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back
This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away
Break (guitar)
Hear that lonesome whistle blow
That's your cue and by now you know
That I got another true love waitin' in Tennessee
That midnight special is burnin' the rail
So woman don't try to follow my tail
Hear her thunder run through the night
That Golden Rocket is doin' me right
And that sunny old southland sure is a part of me
Now from your call board erase my name
Your fire went out you done lost your flame
And this Golden Rocket is rollin' my blues away
Break (fiddle)
That old conductor he seemed to know
You done me wrong I was feelin' low
For he yelled aloud we're over that Dixon Line
The brakeman started singin' a song
Said you're worried now but it won't be long
This Golden Rocket is leavin' your blues behind
Then the porter yelled with his southern drawl
Let's rise and shine good mornin' y'all
And I sprang to my feet to greet the new born day
When I kissed my baby at the station door
The whistle blew like it never before
On the Golden Rocket that rolled my blues away

===== Hank Snow - Married By the Bible, Divorced by the Law =====
What a strange world we live in what a shame oh what a shame
Someone's always quarrelin' then marriage don't remain
Divorces by the thousands is this human race insane
I always thought that marriage should be a sacred thing
Married by the Bible divorced by the law
Everyday there's more and more the worst I ever saw
Things have changed they're not the same as the days of ma and pa
They were married by the Bible no divorced by the law
Steps are often taken without thinking twice
And oft times a child or two who left to pay the price
Those little hearts so innocent they don't know who's to blame
No mom and dad to love them what a shame oh what a shame
Married by the Bible...

===== Hank Snow - The Last Ride =====
In the Dodge City yards of the Sante Fe
Stood a freight made up for the east
And the engineer with his oil and waste
Was groomin' the great iron beast;
While ten cars back in the murky dust
A box-car door swung wide
And a hobo lifted his pal aboard
To start on his last, long ride;
A lantern swung and the freight pulled out
The engine it gathered speed
The engineer pulled the throttle wide
And clucked to his fiery steed;
Ten cars back in the empty box
The hobo rolled a pill
The flare of the match showed his partners' face
Stark white and deathly still;
As the train wheels clicked on the couplin' joints
A song for the ramblers' ears
The hobo talked to the still, white form
His pal for many a year;
For a mighty long time we've rambled, Jack
With the luck of men that roam
With the back door steps for a dining room
And the boxcar for a home;
We dodged the bulls on the eastern route
And the cops on the Chesapeake
We traveled the Leadville Narrow Gauge
In the days of Cripple Creek;
We drifted down through sunny Cal
On the rails of the old S. P
And of all you had, through good and bad
A half always belonged to me;
You made me promise to you, Jack
If I lived and you cashed in
To take you back to the old churchyard
And bury you there with your kin;
You seemed to know I would keep my word
For you said that I was wise
Well, I'm keepin my promise to you, pal
Cause I'm takin' you home tonight;
I hadn't the money to send you there
So I'm takin' you back on the 'fly'
It's the decent way for a Bo to go
Home to the by and by;
I knew that fever had you, Jack
And that doctor just wouldn't come
He was too busy treatin' the wealthy folks
To doctor a worn out bum;
As the train rolled over it's ribbon of steel
Straight through to the east it sped
The engineer in his high cab seat
Keep his eyes on the rails ahead;
While ten cars back in the empty box
The lonely hobo sighed
For the days of old and his pal so cold
Was taking his last long ride

===== Hank Snow - The Face on the Barroom Floor =====
'Twas a balmy summer evening and a goodly crowd was there
Which well-nigh filled Joe's barroom on the corner of the square
And as songs and witty stories came through the open door
A vagabond crept slowly in and posed upon the floor
"Where did it come from?" Someone said. "The wind has blown it in?"
"What does it want?" another cried, "Some whiskey, rum or gin?"
"Here, Toby, seek him, if your stomach's equal to the work!"
"I wouldn't touch him with a fork, why, he's as filthy as a Turk."
This badinage the poor wretch took with stoical good grace
In fact, he smiled as though he thought he'd struck the proper place
"Come, boys, I know there's kindly hearts among so good a crowd
Why, to be in such good company would make a deacon proud."
"Give me a drink - that's what I want - I'm out of funds, you know
When I had cash to treat the gang, this hand was never slow
What? You laugh as tho' you thought this pocket never held a sou
Why, I was fixed as well, my boys, as anyone of you."
"There, thanks - that's braced me nicely - God bless you one and all
Next time I pass this good saloon, I'll make another call
Give you a song? No, I can't do that - my singing days are past
My voice is cracked and my throat's worn out and my lungs are going fast
"Say, Give me another whiskey and I'll tell you what I'll do
I'll tell you a funny story and a fact I promise, too
That I was ever a decent man, not a one of you would think
But, I was some four of five years back - say, give us another drink
"Fill her up, Joe, I want to put some life into my frame
Such little drinks, to a bum like me, are miserably tame
Five fingers - there, that's the scheme - and corkin' whisky, too
Well, here's luck, boys; and landlord, my best regards to you
"You've treated me pretty kindly and I'd like to tell you how
I came to be the dirty sot you see before you now
As I told you once, I was a man with a muscle, frame and health
And, but for a blunder, ought to have made considerable wealth
"I was a painter - not one that daubed on bricks and wood
But an artist and for my age, was rated pretty good
I worked hard at my canvas and I was bidding fair to rise
'Coz gradually I saw the star of fame before my eyes
"I made a picture perhaps you've seen, 'tis called the 'CHASE OF FAME'
It brought me fifteen hundred pounds and added to my name
And then I met a woman - now comes the funny part
With eyes that petrified my brain and sunk into my heart
"Why don't you laugh? it's funny that the vagabond you see
Could ever love a woman and expect her love for me
But 'twas so, and for a month or two, her smiles were freely given
And when her loving lips touched mine it carried me to heaven
"Boys, did you ever see a girl for whom your soul you'd give
With a form like the Milo Venus, too beautiful to live
With eyes like the purest of diamonds and a wealth of chestnut hair?
If so, 'twas she, for there never was another half so fair
"I was working on a portrait one afternoon in May
Of a fair-haired boy, a friend of mine, who lived across the way
And Madeline admired it and much to my surprise
Said she'd like to know the man that had such dreamy eyes
"It didn't take long to know him and before the month had flown
My friend had stole my darlin' and I was left alone
And ere a year of misery had passed above my head
The jewel that I had treasured so, had tarnished and was dead
"That's why I took to drink, boys - why, I never saw you smile
I thought you'd be amused and laughing all the while
Why, what's the matter - friend? There's a teardrop in your eye
Come, laugh like me; why 'tis only babes and women that would cry
"Say, boys, if you'd give me just another whiskey, I'll really be glad
And I'll draw right here a picture of the face that drove me mad
Give me that piece of chalk with which you mark the baseball score
And you shall see the lovely Madeline upon the barroom floor."
Another drink and with chalk in hand the vagabond began
To sketch a face that well might buy the soul of any man
And then as he placed another lock upon the shapely head
With a fearful shriek, he leaped and fell across the picture - dead

===== Hank Snow - These Hands =====
These hands ain't the hands of a gentleman
These hands are calloused and old
These hands raised a family these hands built a home
Now these hands raised to praise the Lord
These hands won the heart of my loved one
And with hers they were never alone
If these hands filled their task then what more could one ask
For these fingers have worked to the bone
Now don't try to judge me by what you'd like me be
For my life ain't been much success
While some people have power but still they grieve
While these hands brought me happiness
Now I'm tired and I'm old and I ain't got much gold
Maybe things ain't been all that I planned
God above hear my plea when it's time to judge me
Take a look at these hard working hands
(God above hear my plea when it's time to judge me)

===== Hank Snow - The Drunkard’s Son =====
In an old dusty attic of a tenement house
I happened to wander one day
And there on the rafters 'neath shavings and chips
A drunkard's poor little boy lay
Oh why are lying up here in the cold
What makes you lie on this hard bed?
My father's a drunkard and he beat me today
My darling old mother is dead
I'm hiding from father and please sir, don't tell
He beat me 'cause I would not steal
He said he would kill me the next I failed
And I'm so afraid sir, he will
I'm leaving you here, son, I sadly replied
But I will be back right away
But when I returned to the attic I found
That Jesus had been there that day
The chips and the shavings were there as before
And the little boy lie on his bed
With tears on his cheeks and his hands at his side
The poor little fellow was dead
A picture of mother lay close to his heart
A faint little note by his head
As I opened the paper, my eyes filled with tears
For these were the words that I read
I'm hiding with Jesus across the divide
With dear mother forever I'll dwell
And thank you dear mister for your kindness to me
And now it's alright if you tell

===== Hank Snow - Blue Danube Waltz =====
All the years have come, and the years have gone
But the oft told tale is not true
For of all the things the Danube is
The Danube is not blue
The Danube is green
What's more it ain't clean
It's green as a bean
It ain't not serene
And though the blueberry looks a little purple
And though your maple syrup looks a little murple
Don't believe what you have heard or you have saw
Oh the Danube isn't blue, it's green
Oh, the Danube is green as the grass in the spring
It's as green as the dollar you spend on a fling
It's as green as the paint that you put on the screen
Oh the blue of the Danube is greener than green
The Danube isn't blue (Am I blue? No!)
The Danube has another hue (Who? Me? You!)
It's time we all came clean, (B.O.)
'Cause the Danube isn't blue, it's green

===== Charlie Rich - The Most Beautiful Girl =====
Hey, did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world
And if you did, was she crying, crying
Hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her
I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun
I lost my head and I said some things
Now comes the heartache that morning brings
I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me
So hey, did you happen to see
Did you happen to see
Oh, won't you tell her that I love her...

===== Charlie Rich - Behind Closed Doors =====
My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't she make me proud
She never makes a scene
By hangin' all over me in a crowd
'Cause people like to talk
Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know she'll be leavin' with me
And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't she make me smile
She's never far away
Or too tired to say "I want you"
She's always a lady
Just like a lady should be
She's still a baby to me
'Cause when we get behind closed doors
And she makes me glad I'm a man
Behind closed doors!

===== Charlie Rich - Rollin’ With The Flow =====
Once was a thought inside my head
'Fore I'd reach thirty I'd be dead
Now somehow on and on I go
I keep on rollin' with the flow
Folks said that I would change my mind
I'd straighten up and do just fine
Ah, but I still love rock and roll
While guys my age are raising kids
I'm raisin' hell just like I did
I've got a lot of crazy friends
And they forgive me of my sins
Some might be callin' me a bum
But I'm still out there havin' fun
And Jesus loves me, yes, I know
So, I keep on rollin' with the flow
(Keep on rollin' with the flow)
But I'm raisin' hell just like I did
Can't take it with you when you're gone
But I want enough to get there on
And I ain't ever growin' old
I ain't ever growin' old
If I keep on rollin' with the flow
(Keep on rollin', keep on rollin')
Keep on rollin' with the flow

===== Charlie Rich - Feel Like Going Home =====
Lord I feel like going home
I tried and failed and I`m tired and weary
Everything I ever done was wrong
And I feel like going home
Lord I tried to see it through
But it was too much for me
And now I`m coming home to you
Cloudy skies are rolling in
And not a friend around to help me
From all the places I have been
Repeat 1st verse

===== Charlie Rich - On My Knees (1977) =====
On my knees, I ask you please
Honey, let me love you
Let me kiss you like I used to
When we meet on the street
I want to love you
I want to kiss you like I used to
Well, you used to be my baby
Mmm, and I don't mean maybe
I need you to be my baby now
Honey, don't you hear me calling
Please help me, I'm falling
Can't we work the whole thing out
Somehow, somehow
Every day you're away
(Janie Fricke)
On your knees
You've asked me please
If you can love me
If you can kiss me like you used to
The next time we meet on the street
Honey, you can love me
You can kiss me like you used to
(Charlie Rich)

Who is the hippie that's happenin' all over our town?
Tearin' up the chicks with the message that he lays down
Who is the coolest guy? That is what I am
Fast talkin', slow walkin', good lookin' Mohair Sam
Chicks are makin' reservations for his lovin' so fine
Screamin' and a-faintin' he's got 'em all waitin' in line

===== Charlie Rich - Who Will the Next Fool Be =====
Woman, when you get rid of me
Who will the next fool be?
I know, I know, I know, I know
There's things I gotta know
'bout the woman I love
And after all is said and done
Girl, you wouldn't be satisfied with anyone
So when you get rid of me
Will he believe all those lies?
End up like me, with tears in his eyes?
'bout the woman I love so
After all is said and done
Hey, girl, you wouldn't be satisfied with anyone
So when you get through playin' with me
You know, after all is said and done
When you get rid of me

Well I make it alright (Well I make it alright)
From Monday morning till Friday night
Oh, those lonely weekends
Since you left me (Since you left me)
I'm as lonely as I can be
You said you'd be (Ooh-wah) good to me (Ooh-wah-wah)
You said our love (Ooh-wah) would never die (Ooh-wah-wah)
But baby, you didn't even try

===== Charlie Rich - I’ll Wake You Up =====
I spent the day just missing you remembering your touch
Counting all the reasons why I love you oh so much
In my thoughts you're always with me, every hour, every day
And if I could be with you right now here's what I'd love to say
I'll wake you up, when I get home
I know you won't care what time it is
'Cause I've been gone, so very long
And honey I've got so much love to give
You know our bed is big and lonesome
When your sleeping all alone
I'm your man and you're my woman
There's a nightlight in the bedroom you left it on so I could see
When I turn the sheets back you'll be waiting there for me
I dream each night when we're apart I'm making love to you
Now I'll wake you up, and hold you close, and make our dreams come true

===== Charlie Rich - Life Has Its Little Up’s And Downs =====
I don't know how to tell her
That I didn't get that raise in pay today
And I know how much she wanted the dress in Baker's window
And it breaks my heart to see her have to wait
And cancel all the plans she made to celebrate
But I can count on her to take it with a smile and not a frown
She knows that life has its little ups and downs
Like ponies on a merry-go-round
And no one grabs the brass ring every time
But she don't mind
She wears a gold ring on her finger
And it's mine
The new house plans we've had so long
I guess will gather dust another year
And the daffodils are blooming that she planted way last fall
Up on the hill and over by the gate
And Lord knows I hate to say again we'll have to wait
But you can bet that she'll just take it with a smile and not a frown
'Cause she knows that life has its little ups and downs
And I'm so glad that it's mine

===== Charlie Rich - Every Time You Touch Me (I Get High) =====
Every time you touch me
I get high
And every time you're near me
I can fly
High above the clouds and rain
Way above the hurt and pain
And when you're gone
I fall down from the sky
But every time you touch me
I've been touched by the angels
And I've been kissed by the very best
And I've been love hard by quite a few
But after you
I forget the rest
'Cause every time you touch me
When your fingers touch my skin
That's when I start to live again
'Cause without your love
I'd lay right down and die

===== Charlie Rich - A Very Special Love Song =====
Babe, somewhere I know I'm gonna find it, babe
It'll have my love behind it
And it will be a symphony of all you mean to me
A very special love song
And babe, if there's a way you know I'm gonna say it babe
If there's a melody I'll play it
And I'll play it through especially for you and all the words are true
So don't be surprised if you're sittin' alone and you hear it
'Cause I'm goin' to sing it to the whole big lonely world
So turn your radio way down low and get near it
And I'll tell the world I love you girl
Babe, if there's an ounce of love I'm gonna give it to you
Babe, if there's a breath of life I'm gonna live it every day for you
And all the whole night through, singin' just for you
A very special love song, for you

===== Charlie Rich - There Won’t Be Anymore =====
Don't wait for the postman
If you're looking for a letter from me
There won't be anymore
And don't sit by your telephone
If you're waiting for a call from me
Don't think of the love we had (We had)
'Til you turned bad (Turned bad)
And broke my loving heart in two
And when your heart is breaking
And you need some loving from me
It won't be like before
There just won't be anymore

===== Charlie Rich - San Francisco Is A Lonely Town =====
Two happy people on a Greyhound bus
We came here looking for a life for us
But the nightlife is her new life and the only thing I've found is
San Francisco is a lonely town
Oh, there were good times for a little while
But now her new friends say I cramp her style
I guess I'm only in the way now and she don't need me hanging round
Now she's out there somewhere across the Bay
And she'll be wondering where I am when she gets in today
She'll find I've left her a oneway ticket home
And while she stands there crying all alone
And while the Greyhound keeps on rolling I'll pray the Lord she's found
San Francisco is a lonely town...

===== Charlie Rich - Have A Heart =====
Would you lend a helping hand to save a drowning man
Could you refuse a hungry child a crust of bread
And if were a millionare would you have a dime to spend
For a beggar or would you turn away in the stand
(Have a heart) this man is drowning (have a heart) this child is hungry
(Have a heart) this beggar's begging you please don't walk away
(Have a heart) I'm drowning in my tears (have a heart) oh I'm hungry for your kiss
I'm begging on my knees have a heart and please love me
I'm begging on my knees have a heart and please love me...

===== Charlie Rich - I Love My Friend =====
She was crying
And I was lonely
And a band was playing
Some old love song
Someone had hurt her
And someone had left me
And We both needed something
To hold on to
Who knows
Tomorrow it might all end
But tonight I love my friend
I love my friend
And we'll make it
Maybe
Just maybe
Even though we're going to share the night
In each other's arms
I'll treat her like a lady
And I'll call her baby
Cause I love my friend
We'll make it
Tomorrow when we start another day
And we don't know the way
I'll still treat her like a lady
Still call her baby

===== Charlie Rich - Anywhere You Are =====
Anywhere you are
Anyplace that you may be
Whether near or far from me
You are too far from me
Whether in the night
Or maybe on the brightest day
Anytime that you're away
And I don't need your consolation
I only need your sweet inspiration
Anywhere you go
Baby let me go there too
'Cause I just got to be with you
Or you are too far from me
I just got to be with you

===== Charlie Rich - Don’t Put No Headstone On My Grave =====
Don't put no headstone on my grave
'Cause all my life I've been a slave
And I don't want the world to know
Here lies the man that loved you so
Don't send no flowers when I'm gone
Just put me down, and then move on
Just put me down and let me be
Free, from all this misery
And tell my Mother not to cry
I'll see her in the by and by
Tell her that I'm finally free
From all the trouble you caused me
I don't want the world to know
Yeah Tell my Mother not to cry
No, I don’t want the world to know

===== Charlie Rich - Rebound =====
Look out baby I'm after you
You done something to me that you ought not do
Played me up and now you've made me blue
And I'm lonely
Well, I guess I'm on the rebound
That's what people say
I lost the only one I found
Who can make me feel this way
Yeah, and I'm lonely over you
Well, look out baby, better change your ways
You done something to me that's drivin' me crazy
Catch up with you one of these days
'Cause I'm lonely
Yeah, I guess I'm on the rebound
Guess I've lost my touch
You're the only one for me
And I love you much too much
And I'm lonely over you
You oughta be ashamed of yourself
Treatin' me this way
Didn't know what it was all about
But I'm gonna find out someday
Yeah, you better look out baby
Gonna make you mad
You're gonna miss me and the things you had
Hate to say it, but I'll be so glad
When you're lonely
Yeah, then you'll be on the rebound
I'm waiting for the day
You'll lose the only one you found
Who could make you feel this way
Yeah, you'll be lonely
You'll be lonely
You'll be lonely, just like me
Just like me

===== Charlie Rich - Good Time Charlie’s Got The Blues =====
Everybody's gone away
Said they're movin' to L.A
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leavin' town!
Some caught a freight. Some caught a plane
Find the sunshine, Leave the rain?
They said this town's a waste time
I guess they're right, it's wasting mine!
Some gotta win! Some gotta lose!
Good time Charlie's got the blues!
You know my heart keeps tellin' me
You?re not a kid at thirty-three
You play around you'll lose your wife
You play too long you'll lose your life!
I?ve got my pills to ease the pain
Can?t find a friend to ease the rain
I know I should try and settle down
Everybody?s leaving town

===== Kitty Wells - It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels =====
As I sit here tonight the jukebox playing
The tune about the wild side of life
As I listen to the words you are saying
It brings memories when I was a trusting wife
It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels
As you said in the words of your song
There's many times married men think they're still single
That has caused many a good girl to go wrong
It's a shame that all the blame is on us women
It's not true that only you men feel the same
From the start most every heart that's ever broken
Was because there always was a man to blame

===== Kitty Wells - How Far Is Heaven =====
How far is heaven? Let's go tonight
I want my daddy to hold me tight
A little girl was waiting for her daddy one day
It was time to meet him, when she heard her mommy say
Come to mommy darling, please do not cry
Daddy's gone to heaven, way up in the sky
How far is heaven? When can I go?
To see my daddy, he's there I know
He was called so suddenly, and could not say goodbye
I know that he's in heaven, we'll meet him by and by
The little girl trembled, her tears she could not hide
She looked up for heaven and then she replied

===== Kitty Wells - I’ll Love You ’Till the Day I Die =====
Alone here at home while you're free to run and roam
There's no use in tryin' to make my dreams come true
You have always lied to me, my darlin' I can't see
Any reason for my stayin' here alone
I never start our quarrels and I never rush off mad
I'm the one that asks forgiveness, to love you makes me glad
Life isn't worth it's troubles when when you're livin' withregret
Sometimes I wish that we had never met
After all I've been to you seems you'd be just halfway true
That's expectin' too much from a cheat like you
But I know someday you'll care and, my dear, I won't be there
And you'll be the one who sits alone and cries
Alone and so blue and so much in love with you
Why, oh why did God make such a fool as I
Though your love has been untrue I'm still in love with you
And I guess I'll love you till the day I die

===== Kitty Wells - Makin’ Believe =====
Making believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
But I'll always dream
Still, I'll never own you
Making believe
It's all I can do
Can't hold you close
When you're not with me
You're somebody's love
You'll never be mine
I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you
Making believe that I never lost you
But my happy hours I find are so few
My plans for the future will never come true
What else can I do?

===== Kitty Wells - I Dreamed I Searched Heaven for You =====
I dreamed I had gone to that city
That city where never comes night
And I thought of right angels in glory
I thought of their mansions of light
I gazed for long long years of rapture
On the face of my saviour so true
And I sang with the servants in holy
Then I dreamed I searched heaven for you
I dreamed I searched heaven for you
Searched vainly true heaven for you
Oh won't you prepare to meet me up there
That's we should search heaven for you
I looked on both sides of the river
That flows through the city of God
I searched through bright mansions celestial
And streets of gold pavement thy trod
The faces of saints by the millions
I scanned in my yearning to see
That face I had cherished so fondly
The face that had grown dear to me
I dreamed I searched heaven for you...

===== Kitty Wells - Searching (For Someone Like You) =====
Searching, I've spent a lifetime, darling
Searching, looking for someone like you
Dreaming, in all my dreams I dream
That someday I'd find someone like you
Other love have come my way but they were not for me
Tell me that you're here to stay, don't ever set me free
'Cause I've been searching, I've spent a lifetime, darling
Searching, looking for someone just like you

===== Kitty Wells - Christmas Ain’t Like Christmas Anymore =====
Holidays are lonely days for me no Christmas ain't like Christmas used to be
Since you've gone it's not the same no more no Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore
It once made me happy but now it makes me blue
There's something about Christmas that starts me missing you
No I don't have the spirit as before no Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore
This lonely house don't need no mistletoes for I'm the only one that comes and goes
And since that day you walked out the door well Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore
It once made me happy...
Christmas ain't like Christmas anymore

===== Kitty Wells - Waltz of the Angels =====
The waltz of the angels the moonlight and you
The waltz of the angels I hear each time I hold you tightly in these arms of mine
It's surely from heaven this music I hear
When your lips say I love you in waltz time my dear
There must be a power much higher than I a writer of love songs way up in the sky
The maker of roses of love sweet and true
And the waltz of the angels the moonlight and you
Oh hurry my darling to my waiting arms I'll love you forever and keep you from harm
We know love is endless our hearts have been kissed
By the waltz of the angels and far beyond this
And the waltz of the angels he wrote just for you

===== Kitty Wells - Amigo’s Guitar =====
Tonight they're singing in the villas
Tomorrow you'll be gone so far
Hold me close and say you love me
While Amigo plays his blue guitar
Ay, ay, ay, ay
The moon is lonely
Tomorrow I'll wonder where you are
Ma-na-na morning, my darling
I'll be blue as Amigo's guitar
They've hushed their singing in the villas
All is quiet beneath the stars
Amigo plays Hasta Luego
Upon his lonely blue guitar
The moon is lonely...

===== Kitty Wells - We Buried Her Beneath the Willows =====
One day an angel came down from heaven
An envoy of our God above
From this great world to choose a token
That all his throng in heaven would love
We buried her beneath the willows
With heads bowed low we walked away
God needed her to sing in heaven
We'll meet again on that bright day
A soft song fell within his hearing
He picked our girl her soul her voice
Today our partner sings in heaven
God praised the angel for his choice
We buried her beneath the willows...

===== Kitty Wells - Hey Joe =====
Hey Joe someone stole your pearly girlie walked off with your jolly dolly
Maybe now you chanced to dance with me
Hey Joe I feel mighty lovey dovey let me be your new for toody
I'll be just as sweet as sweet can be
Now Joe I know just how you feel can't your fickle sweety left before a heel
But if I could be your sweety pie I'll promise you no other guy
Would steal me from you
Hey Joe go put on your dancin' shoes and I'll help you forget your blues
I'll simply got to have you for my own
Hey Joe please don't think I'm nuddy noddy don't think I'm a flirty girly
Cause I let you know I go for you
Hey Joe my poor heart is yearning burning just to hold you tightly nighty
Do I need you yes I guess I do
I love you Joe that's how I feel if I have a chance to prove my love is real
I'll be true to you forever and I swear no one could ever hope to steal me from you
Hey Joe if you want me tell me so my heart is packed and set to go
I want you Joe I need you for my own

===== Kitty Wells - I Need The Prayers =====
I need the prayers of those I love
While traveling o'er life's rugged way
That I may true and faithful be
And live for Jesus every day
I want my friends to pray for me
To bare my tempted soul above
And intercede with God for me
To help me in each crying hour
To bare my tempted soul to him
That he may keep me by his pow'r
I want my friends to pray for me...

===== Kitty Wells - Dust On The Bible =====
Dust on the bible
Dust on the holy word
The words of all the prophets
And the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books you'll find
There's none salvation holds
Get that dust off the bible
And redeem your poor soul
I went into a home one day
To see some friends of mine
Of all the books and magazines
Not a bible could I find
I asked them for the bible
When they brought it what a shame
For the dust was covered o'er
It not a fingerprint was plain
Dust on the bible...
You can read your magazines
Read of love and tragic things
And not one verse of Christian
Not one verse do you know
When it is the very truth
And its contents good for you
Will doom your poor soul

===== Kitty Wells - Santa’s On His Way =====
Snowflakes're falling Santa's on his way with a lotta jingle bells jingin' on his place
Boys and girls are waitin' clapping out with glee
Cause they know he'll put lots of toys around the Christmas tree
Shanty wants an aeroplane Suzie wants a doll
Bobby wants a pair of skates and Fred a cowboy gun
Santa got his reindeer waitin' and he'll soon be on his way
Oh Santa will bring lots of joy on this Christmas Day
Shanty wants an aeroplane...

===== Kitty Wells - I Don’t Claim to Be an Angel =====
I don't claim to be an angel
My life's been full of sin
But when I met you darling
That all came to an end
Never doubt my love dear
Whatever you may do
But my love for you is true
You'll hear talk around town
Of things I used to do
Some will try to poison your mind
That my love can't be true
Many nights I lay awake dear
Hoping our love will last
Wondering if your love is strong enough
To forget about my past
I don't claim to be an angel...
I never knew what real love was
Till you came along
You changed my outlook on life
Made me regret my wrongs
Why should my past keep haunting me
All through the years
I paid for each mistake
With millions of bitter tears

===== Kitty Wells - Will Your Lawyer Talk to God =====
Your lawyer called and said he had the papers all prepared
To sign my name was all I had to do
He saw the judge now he's seen me, there's only one thing left
Will your lawyer talk to God for you?
Will your lawyer talk to God and plead your case up on high
And defend the way you broke my heart in two?
Man made laws to set you free on Earth, but is God satisfied?
We all face that final judgement, and it's very strict they say
When your time comes, I wonder what you'll do
Will you bow your head in shame, or will you turn your head away?
Or will your lawyer talk to God for you?
Man made laws that set you free on Earth, but is God satisfied?

===== Kitty Wells - Paul’s Ministry =====
The Lord said stand up Paul and dry up your tears
You must preach my gospel for many long years
Go to Damascus the way that is straight
You'll meet Ananias and there you must wait
I counted on Jonah I counted on Cain
I counted on Adam but he was the same
I counted on Judas but he proved untrue
Oh, go tell the world Paul I'm counting on you
Three days have gone by Lord and yet I don't see
But here stands my brother a talking with me
He says brother Paul the Lord in the sky
Has sent me to heal you and open your eyes
I'll send you to the Gentiles I'll send you to Rome
But Paul you must suffer till I call you home
You'll sleep in the desert you'll be wrecked out at sea
But keep right on preaching my gospel for me

===== Kitty Wells - Three Ways (To Love You) =====
There are three ways three ways three ways to love you it's true
One is the wrong way one is the right way but the best is the way I love you
One is the wrong way like some people do
They're kissin' they're lyin' they'll never be true
But soon they will wonder why love flies away
And though how they'll cry when they'll find out some day
There are three ways...
One is the right way so some people say with dining and dancing in some cabarete
Now some girls may think this is really ideal
But too late they'll find out that love isn't real
One is the best way the way I love you
With all of my heart and for all my life through
I think of you only forget all the rest I'll show you my darling that my way's the best

===== Kitty Wells - He Will Set Your Fields On Fire =====
There's a call that rings for the one
Who sings to those now gone astray
Saying come ye men and your load of sin
There at the altar lay
You don't seem to heed at the chain
Of greed your conscience never tires
Be assured my friend if you still offend
He will set your fields on fire
If you don't from sin retire
You have heard Jesus call
And in death your soul must fall
Now my friends if you desire
You may join the heavenly choir
And rejoice with him free from every sin
When he sets this world on fire
You have heard his voice
Seen the souls rejoice
That trusted in his grace
You have blushed with sin
And he knocked within
But still you hide your face
From the blessed Lord in his own true word
But still you say retire
Flee the downward path kindle not his wrath
Or he'll set your fields on fire
If you don't from sin retire...

===== Kitty Wells - Heartbreak U.S.A. =====
(Back home in heartbreak USA)
The harbor's empty, my love has gone
With aching heart I face each cold and lonely dawn
And till the trade winds bring him home to stay
I'll live in heartbreak USA
Don't let those Geisha girls get your heart in a whirl
And if you meet some sweet Fraulein remember you're mine
Don't forget your sweetheart while you're away
Back home in heartbreak USA
Sometimes I'm lonely and time stands still
And I wonder if you feel the way I always will
So darling write me letters every day
In care of heartbreak USA
Don't let those Geisha girls...

===== Bobby Bare - 500 Miles Away from Home =====
I'm five hundred miles away from home
Teardrops fell on mama's note when I read the things she wrote
She said we miss you son we love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home
Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes I'm five hundred miles away from home
I know this is the same road I took the day I left home but it sure looks different now
Well I guess I look different too 'cause time changes everything
I wonder what they'll say when they see their boy looking this way
Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home
Can't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home
Yes I'm still five hundred miles away from home
Lord I'm still five hundred miles away from home

===== Bobby Bare - Marie Laveau =====
The most famous of the voodoo queens that ever existed
Is Marie Laveau, down in Louisiana
There's a lot of weird ungodly tales about Marie
She's supposed to have a lot of magic potions, spells and curses....
Down in Louisiana, where the black trees grow
Lives a voodoo lady named Marie Laveau
Got a black cat's tooth and a Mojo bone
And anyone who wouldn't leave her alone
She'd go another man done gone

With a one-eyed snake and a three-legged dog
She's got a bent, bony body and stringy hair
If she ever seen why'all messing round there
And then one night when the moon was black

Made a million dollars and she put it in his hand
Then she giggled and she wiggled, and she said Hey, Hey
I'm getting ready for my wedding day
But old handsome Jack he said goodbye Marie
You're too damned ugly for a rich man like me
Then Marie started mumbling her fangs started gnashing
Her body started trembling and her eyes started flashing
And she went another man done gone
So if you ever get down where the black trees grow
And meet a voodoo lady named Marie Laveau
If she ever asks you to make her your wife
Man, you better stay with her for the rest of your life
Or it'll be another man done gone

===== Bobby Bare - Detroit City =====
I wanna go home, I wanna go home
Oh, how I wanna go home
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about those cottonfields and home
I dreamed about my mother dear, old papa, sister and brother
I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long
I wanna go home, I wanna go home, oh, how I wanna go home
Homefolks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars, by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines
Cause you know I rode the freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride
And put it on a Southbound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones, the ones that I left waitin' so far behind
Oh, how I wanna go home...

===== Bobby Bare - Abilene =====
Abilene, Abilene
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene
Crowded cities ain't nothing free
Nothing in this town for me
How I wish that I could be
I sit alone most every night
Watch those trains pull out of sight
How I wish they were carrying me back
To Abilene, sweet Abilene

===== Bobby Bare - The Winner =====
The hulk of a man with a beer in his hand he looked like a drunk old fool
And I knew if I hit him right why I could knock him off of that stool
But everybody they said watch out hey that's the Tiger Man McCool
He's had the whole lotta fights and he's always come out winner yeah he's a winner
But I had myself about five too many and I walked up tall and proud
I faced his back and I faced the fact that he had never stooped or bowed
I said Tiger Man you're a pussycat and a hush fell on the crowd
I said let's you and me go outside and see who's the winner
Well he gripped the bar with one big hairy hand then he braced against the wall
He slowly looked up from his beer my God that man was tall
He said boy I see you're a scrapper so just before you fall
I'm gonna tell you just a little bout what it means to be a winner
He said now you see these bright white smilin' teeth you know they ain't my own
Mine rolled away like Chicklets down the street in San Antone
But I left that person cursin' nursin' seven broken bones
And he only broke ah three of mine that makes me the winner
He said now behind this grin I got a steel pin that holds my jaw in place
A trophy of my most successful motorcycle race
And each morning when I wake and touch this scar across my face
It reminds me of all I got by bein' a winner
Now this broken back was the dyin' act of a handsome Harry Clay
That sticky Cincinnati night I stole his wife away
But that woman she gets uglier and she gets meaner every day
But I got her boy that's what makes me a winner
He said you gotta speak loud when you challenge me son cause it's hard for me to hear
With this twisted neck and these migraine pains and this big ole cauliflower ear
And if it wadn't for this glass eye of mine why I'd shed a happy tear
To think of all that you gonna get by bein' a winner
I got arthritic elbows boy I got dislocated knees
From pickin' fights with thunderstorms and chargin' into trees
And my nose been broke so often I might lose if I sneeze
And son you say you still wanna be a winner
Now you remind me a lotta my younger days with your knuckles a clenchin' white
But boy I'm gonna sit right here and sip this beer all night
And if there's somethin' that you gotta gain to prove by winnin' some silly fight
Well okay I quit I lose you're the winner
So I stumbled from that barroom not so tall and not so proud
And behind me I still hear the hoots of laughter of the crowd
But my eyes still see and my nose still works and my teeth're still in my mouth
And you know I guess that makes me the winner

===== Bobby Bare - The Streets of Baltimore =====
I sold the farm to take my woman where she longed to be
We left our kin and all our friends back there in Tennessee
I bought those one-way tickets she had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore
Her heart was filled with laughter
When she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on Earth
Is Baltimore at night
Well, a man feels proud
To give his woman what she's longing for
And I kind of liked the streets of Baltimore
Well I got myself a factory job, I ran an old machine
I bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene
Yet every night, when I came home with every muscle sore
She would drag me through the streets of Baltimore
Well I did my best to bring her back
To what she used to be
But I soon learned she loved those bright lights
Much more than she loved me
Now I'm a going back on that same train
That brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
Yes, my baby walks the streets of Baltimore

===== Bobby Bare - Dropkick Me, Jesus =====
Dropkick me, Jesus, through the goal posts of life
End over end, neither left nor to right
Straight through the heart of them, righteous up rights
Make me, oh, make me, Lord, more than I am
Make me a piece in Your master game plan
Free from the earthly tem pestion below
I've got the will, Lord, if You got the toe
Bring on the brothers who've gone on before
And all of the sisters who've knocked on your door
All the departed, dear, loved ones of mine
Stick 'em up front in the offensive line
Yeah, dropkick me, Jesus, through the goal posts of life

===== Bobby Bare - Four Strong Winds =====
Four strong winds that blow lonely seven seas that run high
All these things that don't change come what may
But my good times are all gone and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
I may go out to Alberta weather's good there in the fall
Got some friends that I can go to workin' for
Still I wish you'd change your mind if I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more
If I get there before the snow flies and things are going good
You could join me if I sent you down the fare
But if you'll wait until it's winter it would do no good
But the winds sure can blow cold way out there
Four strong winds that blow lonely...

===== Bobby Bare - (Margie's At) The Lincoln Park Inn =====
My names in the paper where I took the Boy Scouts to hike
My hands are all dirty from working on my little boy’s bike
The preacher came by and I talked for a minute with him
My wife’s in the kitchen and Margie is at the Lincoln Park Inn
And I know why she’s there I’ve been there before
But I made a promise that I wouldn’t cheat anymore
I try to ignore it but I know she’s in there my friend
My mind’s on a number and Margie is at the Lincoln Park Inn
Next Sunday it’s my turn to speak to the young peoples' class
And they expect answers to all the questions they ask
What would they say if I spoke on a modern day sin?
And all of the Margie’s and all of the Lincoln Park Inns
The bike is all fixed and my little boy’s in bed asleep
His little warm puppy is curled in a ball at my feet
My wife’s baking cookies to feed to the bridge club again
I’m almost out of cigarettes and Margie is at the Lincoln Park Inn
And I know why she’s there

===== Bobby Bare - Find Out What's Happening =====
Baby, you know me well
You know I mean what I say
Before I say farewell
I'll give you one more day
So you can find out what's happening
Find out what's happening before long
If you don't find out what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone (Gone, gone, gone, gone)
Tell me what you're gonna do
You better make up your mind
It all depends on you
Or I'm leaving you behind
You'd better find out what's happening
Baby, you know it's true
We've been through thick and thin
But if you don't come through
You won't ever see me again
You're gonna find your daddy gone (Gone, gone, gone, gone)
Find out what's happening
Find out what's happening...

===== Bobby Bare - Tequila Sheila =====
Chorus:
Pour me another Tequila Sheila
Take off that red satin dress
I cross the border and I beat the dealer
For all the damn gold in Juarez
I feel like old Pancho Villa, Sheila
And sure could use a friend (I got Pesso to spend)
So pour me another Tequilla Sheila
And lay down n'love me again
Though I can tell you about it
But don't mind my gun by the bed
I feel kind of naked without it
And it eases the fear in my head
Just pass me the salt n'the lemon
Bend down n'blow out the light
I never had trusted the woman
But Sheila I'll trust you tonight
Dor all the damn gold in Juarez
And lay down n'love me again..
Sheila I'm hearing your heart beat
But I'm hearing footsteps outside
The courtyard is crawling with damn federales
And Sheila there's no place to hide
I don't know who could have tipped them
Nobody knew but you
But I can't make love to a squealer, Sheila
So I guess there's just one thing to do
I'm gonna put on your red dress, you put on my cloths
You go out and face the dealer
And Sheila, I wish you the best
I need a fast horse and a friend
So pour me another Tequila Sheila
And I'll ride towards the border again...

===== Bobby Bare - Numbers =====
I was sittin' in Friday's suckin' on a glass of wine
When in walked a chick who almost struck me blind
Had wet blue eyes and her legs were long and fine
On a scale of one to ten, I'd give her a nine
Now on my scale there ain't no ten's, you know
Nine is about as far as any chick can go
So I flashed her a smile, but she didn't even look at me
So for brains and good judgement, I'd give her a three
I said, "Hey sweet thing, you look like a possible eight
You and me could, uh! make eighteen, if your head's on straight."
She looked up and down my perfect frame
And said these words that burned into my perfect brain
She said, well, another one of those macho-matician men
Kind who grade all women on scales of one to ten
And, you give me an eight, well, that's a generous thing to do
Now, let's just see, just how much I give you
She said you comin' on to me with that phony numbers jive
Your style makes me smile, I give it a five
When you walked up I noticed that suit of (yores)
It's last year's double-knit frayed-cuffs, give it a four
That must be your car parked out on the curb
That sixty-nine homemade convertible, a three and a third
Now, as for your build, I guess (yore) less than five
Except, for your pot belly, I'd give that a ten for size
That wine you're pourin' might be fine to you
But I'm used to fine champagne, I give it a two
It's hard to tell what your flashin' smile is worth
I give it a six, you could use some dental work
But, It's your struttin' rooster act that really makes me laugh
It may be a ten to these country hens, but to me a three and a half
And there really ain't much to add once the subtractin's done
Since there ain't no zeroes, I give you a one!
She walked out, while up and down the line
The whole bar was laughin', said' Bare, what happened to your nine
Nine says I, hell soon as she started to talk I knew
She didn't have no class, I barely gave her a two
Spoken:
Yeah! No matter how good they look at first
There's flaws in all of them
That's why on a scale of ten to one, friend
There ain't no ten

===== Bobby Bare - Miller's Cave =====
Way down in the state of Georgia among the swamps and the everglades
There's a big hole in Tiger Mountain
God help the men who gets lost in Miller's Cave
I had a girl in Waycross Georgia but she had unfaithful ways
She made me feel I was unwanted
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave
I caught her out Sunday morning with some guy they call Big Dave
The meanest man in Waycross Georgia
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave
So I said you're gonna pay both you and Davy
Cause I'm gonna see you in your grave
They laughed at me and then I shot 'em
And then I dragged their cheatin' skin and bones into Miller's Cave
I couldn't stand the way she did me cause I guess I showed her I was brave
The most wanted man in the state of Georgia
But they'll never gonna find me cause I'm lost in Miller's Cave

===== Bobby Bare - Leaving on a Jet Plane =====
Oh my bags are packed I'm ready to go I'm standing here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breakin' it's early morn the taxi's waitin' he's blowing his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could cry
So kiss me and smile for me tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leaving on a jet plane I don't know when I'll be back again oh babe I hate to go
There's so many times I've let you down so many times I've played around
I tell you now that they don't mean a thing
Cause every place I go I think of you every song I sing I sing for you
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring
So kiss me and smile for me...
Now the time has come to leave you one more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes and I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come when I won't have to leave alone
About the time I won't have to say
Kiss me and smile for me...

===== Bobby Bare - Sylvia's Mother =====
Sylvia's mother says
"Sylvia's busy, too busy to come to the phone"
"Sylvia's trying to start a new life of her own."
"Sylvia's happy, now why don't you leave her alone?"
Chorus:
And the operator says, "Forty cents more
For the nest three minutes."
Please, Mrs. Avery, I just gotta talk to her
I'll only keep her a while
Please, Mrs. Avery, I just want to tell her goodbye, goodbye
Please, Mrs. Avery, I just want to tell
"Sylvia's packin', shes gonna be leavin' today."
"Sylvia's marryin', a fellow down Galveston way."
"Please don't say nothin' to make her start cryin' and stay."
"Sylvia's hurryin', she's catchin' the nine o'clock plane."
"Take your umbrella, 'cause sylvia it's startin' to rain."
"Thank you for callin' and sir, won't you call back again?"
Please, Mrs. Avery, I just want to tell...

===== Bobby Bare - Come Sundown =====
I heard the front door closing softly as I wakened from my sleep
With the last touch of her lips Lord like a whisper on my cheek
And I cursed the sun for rising for the worst Lord is yet to come
Cause this morning she's just leaving but come sundown she'll be gone
See the lipstick on the pillow that I placed beneath her head
And the soft sheets still feel warm Lord where she lay upon my bed
And it hurts to know it's over for the hurt Lord has just begun

===== Bobby Bare - Daddy What If =====
(Daddy what if the sun stop shinin' what would happen then)
If the sun stopped shinin' you'd be so surprised
You'd stare at the heavens with wide open eyes
And the wind would carry your light

===== Bobby Bare - Green, Green Grass of Home =====
The old hometown looks the same as I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa
And down the road I look and there runs Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to meet me arms areaching smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's the old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
Then I awake and look around me at the grey walls that surround me
And I realized I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green green grass of home

===== Bobby Bare - The Jogger =====
Well I've been a trucker more than twenty years
From the Charleston coast to the Jersey piers
Sharin' the road with race car nuts and loggers
Sunday drivers scouts on hikes Hells Angels on Harley bikes
I never met a roader I didn't like cept them joggers
One day I'm rollin' down 1-0-1
I got 18 wheels under 14-tons
Radio playin' a good ol' country rocker
The day was sure a trucker's dream
The sky was sunny and the air was clean
When up ahead on the road I seen one of them joggers
He was dressed like they do in baby blue
With shortie shorts and a headband too
I yelled Sweetie I bet that you are the hit of the men's room locker
But I'm a runnin' late with an overload
So get your Adidas off a this road
I'm LA bound and I don't slow down for dead raccoons or joggers
Well without breakin' stride or losin' poise
He said you and that rig sure make some noise
But I can't talk now cause I'm racin' against the clocker
But it's just nine miles to Forkers Leap
And if you ain't afraid to race that heap
We'll see how that ol' rig holds up against a super jogger
Race I must be hearin' wrong
The boy's been runnin' in the sun too long
The only place he's racin' to is a doctor's
But before I could say thank you no
That fool yells ready get set go
And the race is on we're off and gone me and that maniac jogger
Well I could've left him far behind
But I played with him like a fish on a line
And I stayed about a half a mile behind that sucker
Then I pushed her up to forty-five
And he sees me comin' and he starts to fly
So I pushed her to sixty and shift to high and finally catch that jogger
And it wasn't easy
Now I'm doin' eighty and I turned to check
And he's stayin' right with me neck in neck
His hearts a thumpin' like my engine goin' pop pop pocker
Then he yells out I hope you're set
Cause I ain't shifted into second yet
Then he unwinds and leaves me behind eaten the dust of a jogger
Then I see Him joggin' up into the sky
And He yells hey thanks for the exercise
I hope that losin' this race was not too shockin'
Ya see my Dad says Heaven's no place to run
And I try to be an obedient Son
So I have to come down to earth to do my joggin'
Well that's my story take it or leave it
My trucker buddies they believe it
So do those race car nuts and Harley hoggers
And I'm still drivin' much the same
Cept I don't call nobody names
And I tip my hat each time I pass one of them good old joggers
Hey here comes one now... Hey good buddy
How ya doin?
Want some gatorade?

===== Porter Wagoner - The Carroll County Accident =====
Carroll County's pointed out as kind of square
The biggest thing that happens is the county fair
I guess that's why it seemed like such a big event
What we all call the Carroll County accident
The wreck was on the highway just inside the line
Walter Browning lost his life and for a time
It seemed that Mary Ellen Jones would surely die
But she lived long enough for her to testify
Walter Browning was a happy married man
And he wore a golden wedding ring upon his hand
But it was gone, nobody knew just where it went
He lost it in the Carroll County accident
Mary Ellen testified he flagged her down
Said he was sick and could she drive him into town
No one even doubted what she said was true
'Cause she was well respected in the county too
I went down to see the wreck like all the rest
The bloody seats, the broken glass, the tangled mess
But I found something no one else had ever seen
Behind the dash in Mary's crumpled up machine
A little match box circled by a rubber band
And inside the ring from Walter Browning's hand
It took awhile to figure out just what it meant
The truth about the Carroll County accident
By dark of night I dropped the ring into a well
And took a sacred oath that I would never tell
Cause the County ordered dad a marble monument
I lost him in the Carroll County accident

===== Porter Wagoner - Fallen Leaves =====
Fallen leaves that lie scattered on the ground
The birds and flowers that were here now can't be found
All the friends that he once knew are not around
They are scattered like the leaves upon the ground
Some folks drift along through life and never thrill
To the feeling that a good deed brings until
It's too late and they are ready to lie down
There beneath the leaves that scattered on the ground
Lord let my eyes see every need of every man
Make me stop and always lend a helping hand
Then when I'm laid beneath that little grassy mound
There'll be more friends around than leaves upon the ground
To your grave there's no use taking any gold
You cannot use it when it's time for hands to fold
When you leave this earth for a better home someday
The only thing you'll take is what you gave away

===== Porter Wagoner - The Cold Hard Facts of Life =====
I got back in town a day before I'd planned to
I smiled and said "I'll sure surprise my wife"
I don't think I'll phone, I'll just head on home
For I didn't know the cold hard facts of life
I passed a little wine store on the corner
I pictured pink champagne by candlelight
I stopped the car right then, got out and hurried in
My mind not on the cold hard facts of life
A stranger stood there laughing by the counter
He said "I'll take two bottles of your best"
Her husband's out of town and there's a party
He winked, as if to say "You know the rest"
I left the store two steps behind the stranger
From there to my house, his car stayed in sight
But it wasn't 'til he turned into my drive that I learned
I was witnessing the cold hard facts of life
I drove around the block 'til I was dizzy
Each time the noise came louder from within
And then I saw our bottle there beside me
And I drank a fifth of courage and walked in
Lord, you should've seen their frantic faces
They screamed and cried "Please put away that knife"
I guess I'll go to hell or I'll rot here in this cell
But who taught who the cold hard facts of life?
Who taught who the cold hard facts of life?

===== Porter Wagoner - I Knew This Day Would Come =====
He'd just turned forty-seven when she was only twenty-two
She'd turned his life to heaven from the hell that he'd been through
All her friends said she was crazy she must have lost her mind
She said age makes no difference and it didn't at the time
Through the years she was his comfort oh but anyone could see
That he was growing older and she was growing free
She came in late one morning he said hold me one last time
You don't need to say it's over i've known it all the time
I knew this day would come oh but we sure gave love a whirl
Now the age that made no difference makes all the difference in the world
But i can't hold back the seasons i curse the rising sun
I already know your reasons for i knew this day would come
She said i found a young man he's only half my age
He says age makes no difference it's the heart that sets the stage
The old man listened quietly then he said
You know someday he'll come in late one morning and it'll be your time
To say i knew this day would come i knew this day would come

===== Porter Wagoner - Dreaming of a Little Cabin =====
In dreams of yesterday I wander back to my little cabin door
I strolled beside an old rock garden and saw familiar scenes once more
I heard the organ softly playing its music came so sweet and low
And I heard my mother softly saying as she did so many years ago
(I was dreaming of a litttle cabin when I heard somebody called my name
I looked and saw a sweet old lady I did seem I was a child again
She gently put her arms around me and kissed her little boy once more
And I knew it was the same sweet mother that have kissed me many times before)
I heard her sing the rock of ages and silver threads among the gold
She told me once again of Jesus within a little cabin fold
She opened up a faded Bible where the family record used to be
And I knew it was the same sweet mother that years ago had craded me
(I was dreaming of a litttle cabin...

===== Porter Wagoner - A Satisfied Mind =====
How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I could do things my way
But little they know that is so hard to find one rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Once I was waiting in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it's happened I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind
Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When life has ended my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there's no doubt
But there's one thing for certain when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

===== Porter Wagoner - The Rubber Room =====
In a buildin' tall
With a stone wall around
There's a rubber room
When a man sees things
And hears sounds that's not there
He's headed for the rubber room
Illusions in a twisted mind
To save from self-destruction, hmm
It's the rubber room
Where a man can run into the wall
Till his strength makes him fall and lie still
And wait for help in the rubber room
From his blurry vision of doom
A psycho in the rubber room
The man in the room right next to mine
Screams a woman's name, hits the wall in vain
He's in the rubber room
I hear footsteps poundin' on the floor
God, I hope they don't stop at my door
Hmm, I'm in the rubber room
Now they've come to get me, but they find
I'm a-screamin' pretty words, tryin' to make 'em rhyme
I'm in the rubber room
Hmm, a psycho
Doom, doom, doom
Zoom, boom, doom
Zoom, boom, boom
The rubber room
Boom, hmm

===== Porter Wagoner - What Would You Do (If Jesus Came to Your House) =====
(What would you do what would you do if Jesus came to spend some time with you)
If Jesus came to your house to spend a day or two
If he came unexpectedly I wonder what you'd do
When you saw him comin' would you meet him at the door
With arms outstretched and welcome to your heavenly visitor
Or would you need to change some things before you let him in
Like burn some magazines and put the Bible where they'd been
Oh I know that you'd give your nicest room to such an honered guest
And all the food you would serve to him would be the very best
And you'd keep assuring him that you were glad to have him there
That serving him in your home was a joy beyond compare
But what about your family conversation would it keep up its normal pace
And would you find it hard each meal to say a table grace
Would you be glad to have him stay forever on and on
Or would you sigh of great relief when finally he had gone
You know it might be interesting to know the things you'd do
If Jesus came in person to spend some time with you

===== Porter Wagoner - Old Log Cabin for Sale =====
While strolling along in the country reviewing the scenes new and old
I found an old fashioned log cabin so beautiful there to behold
A stranger was standing in silence his eyes firmly fixed on the door
My heart ached in pity to see him for these were the words that it bore
And the sign it read An Old Log Cabin For Sale an oaken bucket and well
Easy terms just keep a log on the fire and a light burning bright in the dell
Many years an old couple so patiently looked for their boy who's last promise did fail
Now the old rocking chair will be rocking no more there's an old log cabin for sale
( guitar )
A welcome I read on the floormat an old braided rug by the door
The hands of an angel had made it with many a prayer prayed before
In an old rocking chair on she waited for one glimpse of him how she yearned
But now he was standing in silence too late yes too late he'd returned
And the sign it read...

===== Porter Wagoner - Misery Loves Company =====
So break out the bottle bring on the crowd
Just gather round me cause misery loves a company
I've just left my home friends where I couldn't sleep
For missin' a woman that I couldn't keep
She just walked out and left me for somebody else
Now her memory keeps hauntin' me when I'm by myself
Tell funny stories turn the jukebox up loud
Come on sit at my table where the drinks are on me
Just gather round me cause misery loves company
Now I'm not the first one who's lost everything
To a false hearted woman with a false hearted dream
But this is the first time I've suffered myself
Help me get over this love I'll handle the next love all by myself
So break out the bottle...

===== Porter Wagoner - Canaan’s Land =====
I'm on my way to Canaan's land I'm on my way to Canaan's land

I'm on my way to Canaan's land...

(If you brother don't go don't hinder me...

===== Porter Wagoner - I Thought I Heard You Calling My Name =====
You said goodbye to me this morning
With only these words to explain
You say you've found someone you love better
But I still hear your voice call my name
I thought I heard you calling my name
Funny I still feel this way
Your voice seemed so close but I knew
That by now you were many miles away
I walk through the streets of the city
People passing by think it's so strange
I'm talking but there's no one beside me
For I thought I heard you calling my name

===== Porter Wagoner - Daddy and the Wine =====
A child walked in a candy store in faded overalls
Put a nickel on the counter said I think I'll spend it all
I've carried it three months or more you can tell it by the shine
Now I need a sack of candy like my daddy needs his wine
Daddy and the wine goes back three years out of my age
In the old days we were happy dad worked hours long and late
Then mama disappeared one day and so did daddy's mind
And now it's me and daddy mostly daddy and the wine
( fiddle )
The child picked up the sack and then he wandered on outside
We put a roll of green among the jelly beens inside
The clerk was broke and so was I we gave him our last dime
A stranger stole his mommy now his daddy's on the wine
Daddy and the wine...

===== Porter Wagoner - Committed To Parkview =====
There's a man across the hall who sits staring at the floor
He thinks he's Hank Williams hear him singing through the door
There's a girl in 203, who stops by to visit me
And she talks about her songs and the star that she should be
There are lots of special people staying in or passing through
And for one thing or another, committed to Parkview
There's a girl in 307, coming down on thorazine
And a superstar's ex-drummer trying to kick Benzedrine
There's a boy just below me who's the son of some well-known
He was brought in by his mother 'cause his daddy's always gone
There's a bum from down on Broadway and a few quite well to do's
Who have withdrawn from the rat race and committed to Parkview
There's a girl who cries above me, loud enough to wake the dead
They don't know what she has taken that has scrambled up her head
There's a writer and a singer who has tried and tried and tried
They just brought him in this morning an attempted suicide
There are those that never made it, those that did but now are through
Some came of their own good chosing,some committed to Parkview
They wake us about 6:30, just before the morning meal
While they're taking blood pressure, they ask us how we feel
And i always say fantastic there ain't nothing wrong with me
And then they give me my injection and i go right back to sleep
The days are kind of foggy and the nights are dreamy too
But they're taking good care of me, committed to Parkview

===== Porter Wagoner - Highway Headin’ South =====
On a highway headed south somewhere to Dixie
Where the cotton blooms in spring and snow don't fly
I'm gonna rest these chilly bones in southern sunshine
And live where the weather's warm until I die
North Dakota you've got my better years Montana you've got five years of my life
But your subzero wind will never touch me again
Southern folks can't live on snow and ice
On a highway headed south...
When I cross the Dixie line I'll throw away my coat
And my goods down underwear will have to go
I'll never live again where the weather chills you to the bone
I'm tired of livin' like an Eskimo

===== Porter Wagoner - Just Someone I Used To Know =====
There's a picture that I carry one we made some time ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me I say just someone I used to know
Just someone I used to spend some time with just a flame that's lost its glow
But I don't tell them of the nights I cried without you
I say just someone I used to know
Just someone I used to run around with just a friend from long ago
I don't tell them how lost I am without you
I say just someone I used to know I say just someone I used to know

===== Porter Wagoner - You’re Not Home Yet =====
(You're not home you're not home you're not home yet
I can still hear my Lord's voice ringing
There'll be a crowd to greet you a choir of angels to meet you)
If you've got two or three minutes I'd like to tell you a story
It's a story about a preacher
But this story I wanna tell you is about a protectoral preacher
Who went over seas to fight a war
Now this is a war forgot and not for any country
And he fought a long long time and he won a lot of souls
But finally this preacher got old and he was coming home
He just happened to be on the same ship with someone who we call a famous celebry
When the boat docked there were thousands there to meet the celebrity
And they carried him off of his shoulders
But you there wasn't no one there to meet the preacher
And he looked into the heavens and said God did you forget
And it seemed like the heavens broke open
And he said no son I didn't forget but you must remember that you're not home yet
(You're not home...
I didn't forget but son you're not home yet

===== Porter Wagoner - Hundred Dollar Funeral =====
With one nickel in his pocket and a pack of cigarettes
There were no tears of sorrow no tears of regrets
In a plain wooden casket the county laid him away
Just a hundred dollar funeral with no loved ones to pray
There must be a mother who loves him somewhere
Perhaps she had gone home and was waiting up there
Where there's no disappointments around God's great throne
No hundred dollar funerals unloved and unknown
No pretty marble headstone not one friend came
He was lowered by four strangers that didn't know his name
A loser on this earth a death so many must pay
There must be a mother...

===== Porter Wagoner - Be a Little Quieter =====
When you left you said you would not be returning
Nothing here you'd ever want to see again
But each night you've come to visit me in mem'ries
And won't you be a little quieter if you can
Last night I heard you walkin' in the hallway
And your footsteps sounded like a marching band
And I haven't slept in so long I can't remember
So won't you be a little quieter if you can
( fiddle )
Well you're back again tonight out in the kitchen
I can hear you as you rattle the pots and pans
Oh what I'd give to see you when you visit me
Cause these lonely walls're driving me insane
When you're finished with your bath please close the closet
The dripping water sounds juts like a drivin' rain
Each night I'm looking forward to your visit
But won't you be a little quieter if you can
I wish you'd be a little quieter if you can

===== Porter Wagoner - Black Jack’s Bar =====
When I was a young man I played my guitar
I played for the people in Black Jack's Bar
They danced to the music and called me a star
And I took in the money in Black Jack's Bar
I kept things a movin' with a crazy beat I kept up a rhythm with my two big feet
I played pretty women like I played my guitar
And I got into trouble in Black Jack's Bar got into trouble in Black Jack's Bar
One night I played till my fingers were sore
They called for a break and I stepped through the door
I stood there a lookin' at the heaven so grand
When up stepped a woman with a bottle in her hand
She took one swallow and I saw her frown
I turned up the bottle and I guzzled it down
I battled my eyes and I looked at her charms
The next thing I knew she was in my arms I got into trouble in Black Jack's Bar
( fiddle )
I hugged her and kissed her and called her mine
Drunk on her kisses and drunk on her wine
Somebody yelled come and play your guitar
We both stuggered back into Black Jack's Bar
Somebody said you better run for your life
You've been a playin' with the wrong man's wife
He swang his knife and swung my guitar
And I killed me a gambler in Black Jack's Bar I got in trouble in Black Jack's Bar
When I get out of this place called the pen I ain't never comin' back here again
I'm gonna do right and I'm gonna go straight I'm gonna be careful whose wife I date
I ain't a huggin' no woman but mine drinkin' no liquor and not much wine
Sittin' in my cell with my old guitar wonder who's a playin' in Black Jack's Bar
(I got in trouble in Black Jack's Bar) wonder who's a playin' in Black Jack's Bar

===== The Chicks - Cowboy Take Me Away =====
I said, "I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars"
Oh, it sounds good to me, I said
"Cowboy, take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can, into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to Heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you"
I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me
Cowboy, take me away
Closer to you
I wanna grow something wild and unruly"
Oh, it sounds so good to me

===== The Chicks - Landslide =====
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well
Well, I'm getting older, too
So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, maybe
The landslide will bring you down

===== The Chicks - Wide Open Spaces =====
Who doesn't know what I'm talkin' about
Who's never left home, who's never struck out
To find a dream and a life of their own
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone
Many precede and many will follow
A young girl's dreams no longer hollow
It takes the shape of a place out west
But what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed
She needs, wide open spaces
Room to make her big mistakes
She needs, new faces
She knows the high stakes
She traveled this road as a child
Wide-eyed and grinning, she never tired
But now she won't be coming back with the rest
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test
Ah ah ah
As her folks drive away her dad yells, "Check the oil"
Mom stares out the window and says, "I'm leavin' my girl"
She said, "It didn't seem like that long ago"
When she stood there and let her own folks know
She needed, wide open spaces
She knows the highest stakes
(Wide open spaces)

===== The Chicks - Travelin' Soldier =====
Two days past eighteen
He was waitin' for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said, "Would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talkin' to me? I'm feelin' a little low"
She said "I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go"
So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said "I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?"
I cried, "Never gonna hold the hand of another guy"
"Too young for him," they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Nevermore to be alone
When the letter said, "A soldier's comin' home"
So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
He said, "When it's gettin' kinda rough over here
I think of that day sittin' down on the pier
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while"
One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said, "Folks, would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead?"
Cryin' all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marchin' band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair
When the letter said, "A soldier's comin'..."

===== The Chicks - Not Ready to Make Nice =====
Forgive? Sounds good
Forget? I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting
I'm through with doubt
There's nothin' left for me to figure out
I've paid a price
And I'll keep payin'
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
I know you've said
"Can't you just get over it?"
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter, sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over
What it is you think I should
Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could

===== The Chicks - Goodbye Earl =====
Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl
Well, it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And makeup to cover a bruise
Well, she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care
Right away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red-eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide
That Earl had to die
Goodbye, Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feeling weak
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl?
Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?
The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said "Thank you ladies, if you hear from him let us know,"
Well, the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all
So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause
Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Well, is that all right?
Good, let's go for a ride Earl
Hey
Well hey, hey, hey
Aw, hey, hey, hey

===== The Chicks - There's Your Trouble =====
It should've been different, but it wasn't different, was the
Same old story, "Dear John," and so long
It should've fit like a glove, it should've fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring, a token of true love
Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble
So now you're thinkin' 'bout all you're missin' how
Deep you're sinkin', 'round and 'round and draggin' down
Why don't you cash in your chips, why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, chalk it up to better luck
Could've been true love, but it wasn't
It should all add up, but it doesn't
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
There is your trouble

===== The Chicks - Gaslighter =====
Gaslighter, denier
Doin' anything to get your ass farther
Gaslighter, big timer
Repeating all of the mistakes of your father
We moved to California and we followed your dreams
I believed in the promises you made to me
Swore that night 'til death do us part
But you lie-lie-lie-lie-lied
Hollywood welcomed you with open doors
No matter what they gave you, you still wanted more
Acting all above it when our friends divorced
What a lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
You're such a
Repeating all of the mistakes of your father
Gaslighter, you broke me
You're sorry, but where's my apology?
Gaslighter, you liar
You thought I wouldn't see it if you put it in my face
Give you all my money, you'll gladly walk away
You think it's justifiable, I think it's pretty cruel
And you know you lie best when you lie to you
'Cause, boy, you know exactly what you did on my boat
And, boy, that's exactly why you ain't comin' home
Save your tired stories for your new someone else
'Cause they're lie-lie-lie-lie-lies
Look out, you little
Doin' anything to get your ass farther (Ooh)
Just had to start a fire, had to start a fire
Couldn't take yourself on a road a little higher
Had to burn it up, had to tear it down
Tried to say I'm crazy, babe, we know I'm not crazy, that's you
Gaslighting
You're a li-li-li-liar
Oh, honey, that's you
You made your bed and then your bed caught fire
Gaslighter, I'm your mirror
Standin' right here until you can see how you broke me
Yeah, I'm broken
You're still sorry, and there's still no apology
Gaslighter, denier (Yeah)
Repeating all of the mistakes of your father (Gaslighter)

===== The Chicks - You Were Mine =====
I can't find a reason to let go
Even though you've found a new love and she's what your dreams are made of
I can find a reason to hang on
What went wrong can be forgiven, without you, it ain't worth livin' alone
Sometimes I wake up cryin' at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take you away
When for so long you were mine?
I took out all the pictures of our wedding day
It was a time of love and laughter, happy ever after
But even those old pictures have begun to fade
Please tell me she's not real and that you're really comin' home to stay
What right does she have to take your heart away
I can give you two good reasons
To show you love's not blind
He's two and she's four and you know they adore you
So, how can I tell them you've changed your mind?
I remember when you were mine

===== The Chicks - Ready to Run =====
When the train rolls by
I'm going to be ready this time
When the boy gets that look in his eye
When my momma says I look good in white
Oh yeah
Ready, ready, ready, ready...ready to run
All I'm ready to do is have some fun
What's all this talk about love
I feel the wind blow through my hair
I'll buy a ticket to anywhere
You see it feels like I'm starting to care
And I'm going to be ready this time

===== The Chicks - Long Time Gone =====
Daddy sits on a front porch swinging
Looking out on a vacant field
Used to be filled with burley t'bacca
Now he knows it never will
My Brothers found work in Indiana
M' Sisters a nurse at the old folks home
Mama still cooking too much for supper
And me I’ve been a long time gone
Been a long time gone
No, I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone
And it ain't coming back again
Deliah plays that ol' church pian'a
Sitting out on her daddy’s farm
She always thought that we'd be together
Lord I never meant to do her harm
Said she could hear me singin' in the choir
Me, I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin'
And Lord, I've been a long time gone
Lord, I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when
Now me, I went to Nashville
Tryin' to beat the big deal
Playin' down on Broadway
Gettin' there the hard way
Living from a tip jar
Sleeping in my car
Hocking my guitar
Yeah I’m gonna be a star
Now, me and Deliah singing every Sunday
Watching the children and the garden grow
We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin’
But the music ain't got no soul
Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard
They've got money but they don't have Cash
They got Junior but they don't have Hank
I think, I think, I think
The rest is a long time gone
No, I ain't hit the roof since I don’t know when
And it ain't coming back
I said a long time gone
No, I ain't honked the horn since I don’t know when
I said a long time, long time, long time gone
Well it’s been a long time
Long time, long time, long time gone
Oh, it's been a long time gone
Yeah yeah

===== The Chicks - I Can Love You Better =====
She's got you wrapped up in her satin and lace
Tied around her little finger
She's got you thinkin' you can never escape
Don't you know your heart's in danger
There's a devil in that angel face
If you could only see the love that you're wastin'
I can love you better than that
I know how to make you forget her
All I'm askin' is for one little chance
'Cause, baby, I can love you...
Baby, I can love you better
I'm gonna break the spell she's got on you
You're gonna wake up to find
I'm your desire, my intentions are true
Hey, babe, I know in time
You're gonna see what you mean to me
So, open up your eyes 'cause seein' is believin'
'Cause, baby, I can love you
Baby, I can love you...
I can love you better

===== The Chicks - Lullaby =====
They didn't have you where I come from
Never knew the best was yet to come
Life began when I saw your face
And I hear your laugh like a serenade
How long do you wanna be loved?
Is forever enough, is forever enough?
Is forever enough?
'Cause I'm never, never giving you up
I slip in bed when you're asleep
To hold you close and feel your breath on me
Tomorrow there'll be so much to do
So tonight I'll drift in a dream with you
How long do you wanna be loved? (Wanna be loved)
Is forever enough
As you wander through this troubled world
In search of all things beautiful
You can close your eyes when you're miles away
And hear my voice like a serenade
(How long do you wanna be loved?)
(Do you wanna be loved?)
(Wanna be loved)

===== The Chicks - The Long Way Around =====
My friends from high school
Married their high school boyfriends
Moved into houses in the same ZIP codes
Where their parents live
But I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow
I hit the highway in a pink RV with stars on the ceiling
Lived like a gypsy
Six strong hands on the steering wheel
I've been a long time gone now
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down
But I've always found my way somehow
By taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
I met the queen of whatever
Drank with the Irish and smoked with the hippies
Moved with the shakers
Wouldn't kiss all the asses that they told me to
It's been two long years now
Since the top of the world came crashing down
And I'm getting it back on the road now
But I'm taking the long way
I'm taking the long way
I'm taking the long way around
Oh, I just take my time
I won't lay down
And take the long way around
Well, I fought with a stranger and I met myself
I opened my mouth and I heard myself
It can get pretty lonely when you show yourself
Guess I could've made it easier on myself
Well, I never seem to do it like anybody else
If you ever wanna find me, I can still be found

===== The Chicks - Easy Silence =====
When the calls and conversations
Accidents and accusations
Messages and misperceptions
Paralyze my mind
Busses, cars, and airplanes leaving
Burning fumes of gasoline
And everyone is running
And I come to find a refuge in the
Easy silence that you make for me
It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me
And the way you keep the world at bay for me
The way you keep the world at bay
Monkeys on the barricades
Are warning us to back away
They form commissions trying to find
The next one they can crucify
And anger plays on every station
Answers only make more questions
I need something to believe in
Breathe in sanctuary in the
Children lose their youth too soon
Watching war made us immune
And I've got all the world to lose
But I just want to hold on to the

===== The Chicks - Sin Wagon =====
He pushed me 'round
Now I'm drawin' the line
He lived his life
Now I'm gonna go live mine
I'm sick of wastin' my time
Well now I've been good for way too long
Found my red dress and I'm gonna throw it on
'Bout to get too far gone
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition
Need a little bit more of my twelve ounce nutrition
One more helpin' of what I've been havin'
I'm takin' my turn on the sin wagon
On a mission to make something happen
Feel like Delilah lookin' for Samson
Do a little mattress dancin'
That's right I said mattress dancin'
Need a little bit more
Of what I've been missin'
I don't know where I'll be crashin'
But I'm arrivin' on a sin wagon
When it's my turn to march up to old glory
I'm gonna have one hell of a story
That's if he forgives me
Oh, lord please forgive me
Need a little bit more of that sweet salvation
They may take me
With my feet draggin'
But I'll fly away on a sin wagon
I'll fly away on a sin wagon

===== The Chicks - Tonight the Heartache's on Me =====
Coulda heard a pin drop
When they walked through the door
I had to turn my eyes away
My heart fell to the floor
Someone whispered, "Where's her halo?"
'Cause she had an angel's face
He stood there smilin', holdin' on
To the one who took my place
So tonight, the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine 'cause the hurtin's all mine
Tonight the heartache's on me
I wonder if he told her
She's the best he's ever known
The way he told me every night
When we were all alone
She'll find out when the new wears off
He'll find somebody new
She'll learn what the heartache's all about
And what I'm goin' through
But tonight, the heartache's on me, on me, yeah
Yes tonight, the heartache's on me, on me, yeah
Yeah, let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Well, yes tonight, the heartache's on me

===== The Chicks - Without You =====
I've sure enjoyed the rain
But I'm lookin' forward to the sun
You have to feel the pain
When you lose the love you gave someone
I thought by now the time
Would take away these lonely tears
I hope you're doin' fine all alone
But where do I go from here
'Cause without you, I'm not okay
And without you, I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place, ooh
Without you
Well I never thought I'd be
Lyin' here without you by my side
It seems unreal to me
That the life you promised was a lie
You made it look so easy
Makin' love into memories
I guess you got what you wanted
But what about me
Somebody tell my head to try to tell my heart
That I'm better off without you
'Cause, baby, I can't live
Without you, I'm not okay

===== The Chicks - Godspeed (Sweet Dreams) =====
Dragon tales and the "water is wide"
Pirates sail and lost boys fly
Fish bite moonbeams every night
And I love you
Godspeed, little man
Sweet dreams, little man
Oh, my love will fly to you each night on angels wings
Godspeed, sweet dreams
The rocket racer's all tuckered out
Superman's in pajamas on the couch
Goodnight moon will find the mouse
God bless mommy and matchbox cars
God bless dad and thanks for the stars
God hears "Amen," wherever we are

===== The Chicks - Julianna Calm Down =====
Julianna, calm down
You know he's about to leave, but don't panic
Don't give him the satisfaction that you can't handle it
Breathe, it'll be okay
And Harper, hold on
To the piece you know he's gonna try to take when he's gone
And you know exactly where he'll try to take it from
Just put on, put on, put on your best shoes
And strut the fuck around like you've got nothin' to lose
Show off, show off, show off your best moves
And do it with a smile so he doesn't know it's
Put on, put on, put on
Put on, put on
Don't think about his lips
How every time he'd kiss you, you'd tremble
Try to only think about the bad things you remember
I guess this is the time to remind you
Sometimes, what's going through your head
Is just a temporary situation
And light will soon be shed, oh
And do it with a smile so that no one knows it's
Put on, put on, put on, yeah
And Katie, calm down
You know there'll come a time you think you can't handle it
But dig deep and know that you can handle it
And Eva, hold on
To everything you know to be true
Don't let the wolves get the best of you
Breathe, you're gonna make it through
So just put on, put on, put on your best shoes
Put on, put on, put on, oh
Just put on, put on, put on, yeah
And Violet, calm down
And Juno, calm down
And Yaya, calm down
And Berta, calm down
Hesper, calm down
And Amelia, calm down
Naomi, calm down

===== Gary Stewart - Rachel =====
Rachel pays good money for the clothes she wears
For her there's nothing gained without a cost
Twice a week she comes to see me now
And twice a week she leaves me lost
Somewhat like a kid she is at forty two
Her slender body shows the miles
Two husbands gone, Lord and one's still at home
They gave her money, but no child
CHORUS
Her starving body craves a man to love
While in her heart, she wants a child
I'm just the answer to a mother's love
And to a young girl's hungry eyes
Now Rachel she's the leading lady of this town
She plays the role as smooth as ice
She's the woman standing behind her man
And I'm just the kid behind the wife
Rachel taught me things I guess I'd have never known
Like how this world is run on pride
If you can't see yourself with nothing on
Then you've got nothin' left to hide...

===== Gary Stewart - An Empty Glass =====
An empty glass
That last cigarette
Closin' time
And I'm drunk again
But somehow I'll make it home
And cry myself to sleep
And that's the way the day ends
Every night for me
Every night, I'm in some bar
Pourin' whiskey on a heart that's on fire
Forgetting you is no easy thing
Each night for me always ends the same
With an empty glass
It's closin' time
I'm drunk again
Yeah, that's the way the day ends

===== Gary Stewart - She’s Actin’ Single (I’m Drinkin’ Doubles) =====
I've seen men look at her before
And they think I don't see
I'd like to think it makes me proud
But I'm only foolin' me
I know she'll be lookin' back
The minute I'm not there
While she pours herself on some stranger
I pour myself a drink somewhere
She's actin' single, I'm drinkin' doubles
I hide my pain, I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking like the tiny bubbles
I know what she plans to do
But I don't know where or when
If I ask who that stranger was
She'll just say an old friend
I'm not weak, I tell myself
I stay because I'm strong
The truth is, I'm not man enough
To stop her from doing me wrong
My heart is breaking like the tiny bubbles...

===== Gary Stewart - Draggin’ Shackles =====
Draggin' shackles down in Georgia
The mem'ry of her's burnin' up my brain
That woman's every link in these old chains
James' House of Jewellery
Had the ring she liked the most
Just the thing I needed to win her hand
Now, James' House of Jewellery
Is a-missing one fine ring
And James says he isn't sure I bought the ring
I'm draggin' shackles down in Georgia
I get up ev'ry mornin'
Before the birds begin to sing
The only place I see you's in a dream
And the cold chill of a captive heart
Makes me wish I were dead
Huntin' down the road with you in my arms, Lord I can't
Instead, I'm draggin' shackles down in Georgia

===== Gary Stewart - I See The Want To In Your Eyes =====
I see the sparkling little diamond on your hand
It's plain to see that you've already got a man
I can tell you're not about to fall for any of my lines
I see the want to in your eyes
Deep in your smile there's a quiet, soft desire
Like the embers of a once raging fire
You know I could light that fire again, you know it isn't why
How strong's a band of gold
Is it strong enough to hold, when a love has grown cold
And a woman wants a love, sweet and warm
How many women just like you have silent schemes
How many men like me do they sleep with in their dreams
You can stay or you can go and although I sympathize
I still see the want to in your eyes

===== Gary Stewart - She’s Got A Drinking Problem =====
The lady wears the latest styles
And drives a foreign car
She's not the kind You'd ever find
Around a crowded bar
Just one look and you can tell
She's high society
But she's got a drinkin' problem
And it's me
Yes I'm the only black mark
On the lady's life
The one mistake she ever made
Comes home to her each night
There's no way for her to hide it
All the world can see
She's got a drinkin' problem
You can find her every Tuesday
At the bridge club
With her friends
The lady's social calendar
Never seems to end
But there's one thing
That always brings
Down he dignity
She's got a drinkin' Problem

===== Gary Stewart - In Some Room Above the Street =====
There's no place for us to hide
In the neon world outside
So I suppose we'll always meet
In some room above the street
The city lights glow on the shade
But they can't find the love we've made
It's strange that love can come so sweet
Like thieves and beggers when we meet
We'll wake before the break of day
Then like the night we'll steal away
And I can make it through the hours
I spend with mine and you with yours
Cause when I close my eyes I see
You in some room above the street
In some room above the street...
But if he wants your love tonight
Don't turn away don't hurt his pride
Just close your eyes and think of me

===== Gary Stewart - Whiskey Trip =====
I can almost.. See me now
In Acapulco
I can almost.. Feel the breeze
That makes the palm trees sway
The motion.. Of the ocean
In the bottle
Says loving her.. Is just
A sip away
Takin' me a whiskey trip
Loving her with every sip
I'm just like a sailing ship
A'waiting for the winds to blow
Whiskey, you're a friend of mine
You can blow away my mind
To some other place and time
Taking me a whiskey trip
I can almost.. See her now
Here beside me
I can almost.. Smell the perfume
Drifting from her hair
And living with this feeling
Of wanting her
One more drink.. And I know
I'll be there
A'taking me a whiskey trip
Waiting for the winds to blow

===== Gary Stewart - Backslider’s Wine =====
Do not drink backslider's wine
As the rain ruins my alibi
I'm down to tellin' you my troubled mind
It's not the sun bright path
That made me leave my home
It's that fine Backslider's wine
My momma sings out in my memory
Son, don't drink no red eyed shine
Fight for your rights
But,don't just fight for right
And do not drink Backslider's wine
(Break)
I took myself to be a strong and loving soul
Til I found myself, face down on the bar room floor
Crying my god what has become of me
I dare not drink Backslider's wine no more
Do not drink Backslider's wine

===== Gary Stewart - Drinkin’ Thing =====
Every day, I tell myself it's temporary
That it's only 'cause she's young that makes her want another man
Even though she makes me feel unnecessary
I've found a way to help me understand
I've got this drinkin' thing
To keep from thinkin' things
'Bout where you've been, who you've been with
And what you've done
And it's a lonely thing
But it's the only thing
To keep a foolish man in love
Hangin' on
If I wait up at home, I'll only ask her questions
She'd probably the truth, so I don't even ask
So, I sit here on this barstool, feeling helpless
And I wonder just how long a man can last

===== Gary Stewart - Caffeine, Nicotine, Benzedrine =====
Been pushin' that diesel since early dawn
Ain't had no sleep don't know how long
Whole lotta trouble makin' them curves
Now I need a little something to settle my nerves
Hey little waitress make my coffee strong
Pack of king size filters and a country song
Little box of whiteys to help pick me up
Caffein nicotine benzedrine and wish me luck
Rollin' down the highway with heavy eyes
I saw a lit up billboard that had you advertised
Everything for the trucker lotsa parking space
And the sign out front says the Shell is the place
Hey little waitress make a coffee strong...
Well I got hung over left Chicago late
And the big bossman don't like to wait
Memphis in the morning got to burn the wind
And I ain't a gonna make it in the shape I'm in
Hey little waitress make my coffee strong...
Caffein nicotine benzedrine wish me luck

===== Gary Stewart - Shady Streets =====
Shadows fallin' on a Sunday afternoon
We go walkin' seems like the only thing we had to do
Talk about our dreams walking through a world we never really seen
As time goes by it makes me wonder was I really lyin' all along
But in the night it comes like thunder and once again I tell her we're not wrong
Some day the sun will shine just for me and you
And it won't be long till we'll be walking down those shady streets in shiny shoes
Shady streets and shiny shoes
And I try to keep the promises I've made
But this old world well it keeps on turnin' turnin'
And I know one day it's bound to turn our way
Shiny shoes (shiny shoes)

===== Gary Stewart - Dancing Eyes =====
Got me a woman the kind a man talks about
Every night rolls around she likes me to take her out
There's saving us a table down at the old Blue Moon
She'll walk in, take her eyes
And dance them across the room
Dancing eyes, dancing eyes
She's checking out the men of the night
Looks like I'm along just for the ride
Two scotch and sodas
Make that a double on mine
I been through this whole night
I know a thousand times
She'll sit here drinking
But she won't be here long
Just until the band plays a sweet sexy song
Then all them old boys she's been winking at
One by one will make their way
To her shoulder and give it a tap
Then off they'll go dancing
While I sit here and die
She's all over him with her dancing eyes
Dancing eyes, dancing eyes...

===== Gary Stewart - Hank Western =====
Passing thoughts rambles
I'll tell you of a time
I had me a country band down on the Georgia line
I'll tell you of the woman always hanging around
Waiting for my last song
And the night I'd promise she'd have
Let's drink to old Hank western
And all the honky tonks
Here's to the best Georgia peach
I ever laid my best line on
And I'll kiss the neck of the bottle
For every angel I'd held
Who felt that she was the reason
I sang all my songs
I had a good thing going
I had a weakness too
And a good looking woman and any kind of booze
And then one night in a bar down in Lincoln
With a little too much behind my belt
I met the wrong woman to sing my next song
Was sung in the big Georgia jail

===== Gary Stewart - Out Of Hand =====
I never intended
To even know your name
Except for the woman waitin' at home
They've all been the same
I've always been true, except for you
Not even a one night stand
And I never intended
For it to get so out of hand
Out of hand, out of hand
I'm a hard-living kind of a man
I need more to keep me goin'
Than this gold wedding band
You're my kind of woman
I'm your kind of man
Maybe that's the reason
It got so out of hand
For it to go this far
I don't think I can get off
From where we are
Some time to wait, so just a taste
Was all that I had planned
And I'm your kind of a man

===== Gary Stewart - Williamson County =====
Up the stairs and to the back door
Of a Williamson County hotel
Lives a lady who sells her time
Ive grown to know her quite well
Each Sunday would find us
On a picnic by the riverside
Then we'd ride her surrey
Down on Carter's Creek Pike
This Sunday she acts different
I feel theres something strange
Her lips began to speak
Another mans name
To think that only moments ago
I picked her a blood red rose
Now the same hands that catered to her
Are clutching at her throat
She struggled to find strength
Then I heard her scream
You're haunted and love will not die here
I'll return to curse your dreams
So each night in my dreams
My mind will wander
Down to the river
That I put her under
And I ride this nightmare
All over Williamson County
The devil waits on my soul for his payment
I await the hunter of my bounty

===== Gary Stewart - Rainin’ Rainin’ Rainin’ =====
Lord, it's rainin', rainin', rainin' here this morning
Outside I can hear the wind blowing in the pines
Lord I guess I lost that gal tonight
Boys I just lost that woman of mine
Lord I ain't hear the lightning striking
Except for down the hall
All that could be is just another teardrop
Lord I sure hate to hear them fall
Lord, it's rainin', rainin', rainin'…
Somebody saw her on the edge of town
Hitchin' a ride with a suitcase packed
Somebody came along and picked her up
In a big long cherry Cadillac

===== Gary Stewart - Quits =====
What do we call it now
It isn't marriage anymore
Call it new and different
It's not the way it was before
Out of all the words to choose from
There's only one that fits
Call it what you want to
I just call it quits
We've come down to the place
Where love barely fits
I call it quits
Turn and walk away
Across the desert of our hearts
Loves turn to sand we've run out of time
And though we once had something
No words could tear apart
Now you'll be your's and I'll be mine
Call our friends
And tell them...
Tell them that we just don't care
Tell them dreams are flowers
And that our garden's bare
Call it separation, independence
Divorce, if that word fits

===== Gary Stewart - Trudy =====
Call up Trudy on the telephone send a letter in the mail
Tell her I'm hung up in Dallas they won't let me out of this jail
If she asks you how I'm fairin' tell her I'm about to lose my mind
Worried about old John Lee Walker and the girl I left behind
John Lee Walker was a car mechanic and hand for cover and mouth for cash
Luckiest man in Dallas County had a gold watch chain and a black moustache
He loved his whiskey and he loved his women drove a big long Cadillac limousine
Kept a big fine fancy townhouse in Dallas and a hotel suite in New Orleans
Carried a switchblade knife in his left hip pocket a .44 hog leg up under his coat
Cut you down in a New York minute if he catch you cheatin' that was all she wrote
So call up Trudy on the telephone send a letter in the mail
I just got to town last Friday evening sure as hell didn't mean to stay
I was on my way back to Louisiana had a powerful thirst and six months pay
I met a peroxide blonde in a bar on D-ville I was flyin' high and feelin' mean
Poured down a bottle and a half of red eye dropped thirty-five dollars in the slot machine
And the boys in the back was dealing seven cards I set down and won me a hundred-ten
I was rakin' in chips like Grant took Richmond till big John Lee come strollin' in
He ripped off the bar like a 707 pretty soon he done won all of my bread
I accused him of cheating he reached for a pistol grabbed a chair and went upside of his head
Then I took off a running like a motorcycle heard the bullets whinin' and sirens wail
But it took half the cops in Dallas County just to put one coon ass boy in jail

===== Gary Stewart - This Old Heart Won’t Let Go =====
These eyes of mine have cried all they can
Till I'm just a shell of what was once a man
And these shoulders are tired from carrying such a load
This body wants to give up but this old heart just won't let go
My lips are tired of calling out your name
My ears have heard till they're almost insane
And these trembling hands have let the whole world know
Or is there a chance you might come back to my world again
Even in million and one you're the only one that could make me live again
But almost every part of me says no

===== Mel Tillis - Life Turned Her That Way =====
If she seems cold and bitter I beg of you
Just stop and consider all she's gone through
Don't be quick to condemn her for things she might say
Just remember life turned her that way
She's been stepped on and walked on so many times
And I hate to admit it but that last footprint's mine
She was crying when I met her she cries harder today
So don't blame her life turned her that way
She's been stepped on...

===== Mel Tillis - If I Could Only Start Over =====
Now if I could only start over and have a new life to begin
I wouldn't live like a rover and drift like a leaf in the wind
Cause I'm dreaming tonight of old sweethearts and believe me I've had quite a few
But I never dreamed of old sweethearts the way that I dream about you
Yes I let you slip through my fingers while foolishly searching around
But if I could only start over I know you could settle me down
Cause I'm dreaming tonight...

===== Mel Tillis - World (What Have I Done) =====
World what have I done to make you frown on me to cast me endlessly
Into your variety what have I done what have I done
World what have I done to numb my brain with wine to lose all track of time
To know no peace of mind what have I done what have I done
I can get my head above the water I can get my head above the water
World what have I done to no one be a worth to never have no mirth
To live this hell on earth what have I done what have I done
World what have I done to walk these lonely streets wherever returns debit
Too hungry to eat what have I done what have I done
I can get my head above the water

===== Mel Tillis - Walking on New Grass =====
I'm like a cloud driftin' from town to town and each new love just helps me on my way
No one woman's ever gonna tie me down
When one gets too close I just back up and say
Well I gotta be walkin' on new grass singin' a new song
Tomorrow there's no telling where I'll be
But I'll be walkin' on new grass singin' a new song
The next time up the road keeps a callin' me
I'm warning you don't fall in love with me I don't plan on a being here too long
You're just a leaf caught in a playfull breeze
I'll carry you a while then be movin' on
Cause I gotta be walkin' on...
I won't take roots I never stay that long and a bad seed just won't grow anyway
This rollin' stone don't want to gather no moss
So when the grass starts to grow then I'll be on my way

===== Mel Tillis - Ruby Don’t Take Your Love to Town =====
You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating goin' out somewhere
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town
It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chores
And yes it's true I'm not the man that I used to be
Oh but Ruby I still need some company
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralized
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age Ruby I realize
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I'm not around
She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam one hundred times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby don't take your love to town Ruby for God sake's turn around

===== Mel Tillis - Sweet Thang =====
I slipped out of the house about sundown while mama was a washing her hair
And you can bet your bottom dollar she'll come looking for me
When she finds that I'm not there
And if she catches her sweet thang out runnin' around
I know there'll be the debit to pay
She'll come blowing like a cyclone through that door
And I can hear exactly what she'll say
Well has anybody here seen sweet thang I got a notion he'll be headed this way
Cause when my sweet thang's out tomocattin' around
He finds a sandbox like this to play
I wanna tell all you barroom hosses if my sweet thang does have a bite
You'd better take my advice and if you'll blink more than twice
You'd better have something in your eyes
I gave my baby all my money on payday except a little that she don't know that I got
Cause there's a cute little waitress at the corner cafe
And she likes those sugar boys quite a lot
While we were sittin' in this back booth a havin' a talk
She was believin' in every word that I said
When the door blew open and mama walked in yelling loud enough to wake the dead
Well has anybody here seen...

===== Mel Tillis - I Could Never Be Ashamed Of You =====
Everybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round
Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you
All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you
Maybe you've been cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of you

===== Mel Tillis - Unmitigated Gall =====
Well, how can you have the unmitigated gall
To come back now expecting me to fall
Right down on my knees and kiss your feet yeah feet
Feet that one day went a walkin' out on me with a fast talkin'
Slob you hardly knew his name your mind is de-arranged
And where did you get the backbone and grit
To come back now expecting me to fit
Right back into plans that we once made
Plans that now are gone forever
To return never ever I don't want you anymore
So get away from my door
And let me live livе live and let me livе live live
Don't come messing up my life again
How can you have the courage and the nerve
To come back now expecting me to love
You after the way that you've done me
Guess you think that I'm a fool
But you're the one that's blew their cool
I don't need you anymore so get away from my door
And let me live, live, live, and let me live, live, live
Live, live, live, live, live, live
Live, live, live and let me live, live, live...

===== Mel Tillis - Right Back in Your Arms Again =====
So many times I've told myself
We're through, it's done, that's all
And I think that I convinced
My pride that it must never fall
But even though you can't be true
I know that I can't win
'Cause it don't take long till pride is gone
And I'm in your arms again
For just a few lonely hours
And a few sleepless nights
Too many teardrops
And the heart that won't beat right
Too many mem'ries
And the fight that I can't win
And I'm right back in
Your arms again
Too many nights I've laid awake
And prayed for day to come
With my mind made up to just give up
Leave and not return
But a smile or two I get from you
And that old feeling begins
And it don't take long to turn me on
Your arms again...

===== Mel Tillis - That’s Where My Money Goes =====
Oh boy that's where my money goes
I've got a gal in Monroeville she won't dance but her sister will
And I've got a gal out in Florida she won't swing but the show will sway
Work my fingers to the bone so I can take more dollars home
Workin' over time at the mill turn the pay for my baby's bills
My gal wears fancy clothes red tall shoes and rolldown hose
My gal drives a limousine and you know who buys the gasoline
My gal lives like a movie star pink champaigne and caviar
Work my fingers to the bone...

===== Mel Tillis - Old Gang’s Gone =====
The old gang's gone I'm the only one that's left
And I guess that it's about time I moved on out myself
Cause there ain't no use in hanging round a town that's grown so cold
With its used-to-be's and its memories it makes a man feel old
My friends have wed and some are dead and some are far away
From the one horse town that we ran around and the dreams of yesterday
The old gang's gone...
Johnny Green's in Jacksonville he's a doctor now you know
Shaky Sam's in VietNam he volunteered to go
Sandie lives in Tennessee and Mary's moved to Maine
And I don't guess that I'll ever see the likes of them again

===== Mel Tillis - Alone With You =====
How I'd love to be around you when the lonely night surrounds you
How I'd love to be alone with you
What I'd give to have the power to read your mind one hour
Just to be with you one night you and me alone
Kiss your lips and hold you tight and have you for my own
This would be a joy unending could be a real beginning
If I only knew for certain I'd cut out all my flirtin' how I'd love to be alone with you
Won't you try to be my baby just for once and then well maybe
I could always be alone with you I could always be alone with you

===== Mel Tillis - Send Me Down to Tucson =====
No one wants to go down to Tucson in the summer
So this time the boss chose me
I’ve been sort of restless yes he thought it might help if
I got away from my wife and family
There’s been no other woman since the mother of my children
And in each and every way she’s a lady
Now there’s one that I’ll remember a sultry night we spent together
And she satisfied the love inside of me
Go on and send me down to Tucson and I’ll get the job done
And call up the one whose love is free
She may be easy and I love my lady
But the lady don’t satisfy the love inside of me
I know the lady’s not to blame cause they raised her prime and proper
While another takes her pleasures where she can
The one in Tucson she don’t hide it and when she gets excited
She makes you feel your every inch a man
But if I could have a wish that I knew would be granted
Don’t you know that one wish would be
Just to lay beside my lady and she’d be the kind of lady
To satisfy the love inside of me

===== Mel Tillis - Goodbye Wheeling =====
Well I've been reeling around Wheeling West Virginia just a little too long
Well I gotta be leaving cause one deceiving free wheeling woman done me wrong
And it's goodbye Wheeling West Virginia no I don't guess I'll settle down
Since she don't need me Lord I can't see me any longer hanging round this old town
Cause I've got a feeling that I've been concealing many thoughts about traveling on
Cause things ain't grooving so I'd better be a moving
When you wake up in the morning big Wheeling I'm gonna be gone gone gone
Well it's goodbye Wheeling West Virginia...
Goodbye Wheeling I said goodbye Wheeling bye bye so long oh goodbye Wheeling

===== Mel Tillis - Unchained Melody =====
Oh my love my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow to the sea to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh wait for me wait for me
I'll be coming home wait for me
Are you still minе
God speed your love to mе

===== Mel Tillis - Blues Man =====
With a copy of the Myth commercial appeal
For a blanket and faith
Lord knows the first thing I thought
Was the old black man's dead
But he rose and he spoke with a rattlely voice
With tears in his eyes
Of the fame and fortune
And the good times he's known in his life
He said 40 years ago along the river
I’s well know
As the world's greatest bluesman
I went to Basin Street Joe
Oh I set on the best of riverboats
And in houses from here to New Orleans
And I still sing my blues every night
But only in dreams
Oh the times how it changed
Ashamed and never stay like before
But the people they don't wanna hear
The blues man no more
But I see that guitar take an hour
And wrinkle those strings
And I'll show you the whale of the worlds
Greatest blues man
Oh you and me together
We could make the big times roll
Except when people who don't wanna hear
Yeah the times how they change
While the people they don't wanna hear

===== Mel Tillis - Love Is a Two-Way Street (And She’s Makin’ A Lane Change) =====
Ah you saw it in her eyes when she spoke about some stranger
It took you by surprise and you knew you were in danger
You saw that loving fire that she had for you long ago
But not anymore ah and it hurts you to know
Now if you feel like you could die she wants to live forever
It's tearing apart your life it's pulling hers together
Tonight you'll be all alone while she'll be out on the town
But not with you and you're wondering with who
Love is a two way street and she's making a lane change
Taking the green light to someone you don't even know his name
Watching her tail lights pull outta sight down some lover's lane
Sittin' at home all alone with your pride and your shame
Hatin' yourself for praying she'll come back again
Well you know you oughta pack your bags let her to come home to nothing
But nothing's all she's had that's why she's out there running
You're loving her too much to quit
But not enough to take hold or even let go ah so there you sit

===== Mel Tillis - Charlie’s Angel =====
Charlie's somewhere in the bar and this time he's gone too far
'Cause she loves him still she's giving up fine
While he's spreading on the charm with a new love on his arm
I'll be helping Angel make it through the night
And I'm holding Charlie's Angel tonight
I'm in heaven while I'm holding her tight
Charlie acted so unwise walking out on paradise
Charlie thinks his game is cool but he's the picture of a fool
Giving up what most men drеam of all their life
Hell wakе up but much too late and fine his angel couldn't wait
Yes, I'm holding Charlie's Angel tonight

===== Mel Tillis - Are You Sincere =====
Are you sincere when you say I love you?
Are you sincere when you say I'll be true?
Do you mean every word
That my ears have heard?
I'd like to know which way to go?
Will our love grow, are you sincere?
Are you sincere when you say you miss me?
Are you sincere every time you kiss me?
And are you really mine
Every day all the time?
Will our love grow are you sincere?
Tell me are you sincere?
Tell me are you sincere, every time
Every time that you kiss me?

===== Mel Tillis - Every Now and Then =====
A list of things that I would do to get you back again
Would use up all the paper in the world
I've done so many crazy things I'll never make them right
And I know you won't ever come back girl
But I hope at least I get to see you every now and then
Somewhere in a crowd if nothing more
And I'd hate to think of going through life never more to see
The girl who was so close to me before
I know that me calling you would only bring you down
And I don't want you no more down on me
I care how you feel so I'll just stay out of your life
It looks like this is how it's got to be

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - Sixteen Tons =====
Some people say a man is made out of mud
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number 9 coal
And the straw boss said, "Well-a bless my soul!"
I was born one morning, it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake by an old mama lion
Can't no high-toned woman make me walk the line
If you see me comin' better step aside
A lot of men didn't, a lot of men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - Union Dixie =====
Away down South in the land of traitors, rattlesnakes and alligators
Right away! Come away! Right away! Right away, come away!
Where cotton's king and men are chattels
Union boys will win the battles
Right away! Come away! Right away, come away!
We'll all go down to Dixie, away, away!
Each Dixie boy must understand that he must mind his Uncle Sam
Away! Away! We'll all go down to Dixie!
I wish I was in Baltimore, I'd make secession traitors roar
Right away! Come away! Right away! Come away! Right away, come away!
We'll put the traitors all to route, I'll bet my boots we'll whip 'em out
Oh may our Stars and Stripes still wave forever roar the free and brave!
Right away! Come away! Right away, come away! Come away!
And let our motto forever be for Union and for Liberty

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - Dixie =====
Hear the Northern thunders mutter!
Northern flags in South winds flutter!
To arms! To arms! To arms, in Dixie!
Send them back your fierce defiance!
Stamp upon the cursed alliance!
Chorus:
Advance the flag of Dixie! Hurrah! Hurrah!
In Dixie's land we take our stand, and live or die for Dixie!
To arms! To arms! And conquer peace for Dixie!
To arms! To arms! And conquer peace for Dixie
Fear no danger! Shun no labor!
Lift up rifle, pike, and saber!
Shoulder pressing close to shoulder
Let the odds make each heart bolder!
Swear upon your country's altar
Never to submit or falter--
Till the spoilers are defeated
Till the Lord's work is completed!

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - Shenandoah =====
Oh, Shenandoah
I hear you calling
Hi-O, you rolling river
I long to hear you
Hi-O, I'm bound away
’Cross the wide Missouri
Missouri, she's a mighty river
When she rolls down
Her tops'll shiver
Hi-O, I’m bound away
'Cross the wide Missouri
Farewell my dearest
I'm bound to leave you
I'll not deceive you

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - The Fall of Charleston =====
Oh have you heard the glorious news, is the cry from every mouth
Charleston is taken, and the rebels put to rout;
And Beauregard the chivalrous, he ran to save his bacon—
When he saw General Sherman’s Yanks, and “Charleston is taken!”
With a whack, rowdy-dow
A hunky boy is General Sherman
Whack, rowdy-dow
Invincible is he!
This South Carolina chivalry, they once did loudly boast
That the footsteps of a Union man, should ne’er pollute their coast
They’d fight the Yankees two to one, who only fought for booty
But when the mudsills came along it was “Legs, do your duty!”
Babylon is fallen
The end is drawing near!
And from the “Sacred City,” this valiant warlike throng;
Skedaddled in confusion, although thirty thousand strong—
Without a shot, without a blow, or least sign of resistance
And leaving their poor friends behind, with the Yankees for assistance!
How are you, Southern chivalry?
Your race is nearly run!
And again o’er Sumter’s battered walls, the Stars and Stripes do fly
While the chivalry of Sixty-one in the last ditch does lie;—
With Sherman, Grant and Porter too, to lead our men to glory
We’ll squash poor Jeff’s confederacy, and then get hunkydory!
How are you, neutral Johnny Bull?
We’ll settle next with you!

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - The Girl I Left Behind Me =====
The hour was sad, I left the maid
A lingering farewell taking
Her sighs and tears, her steps delayed
I thought her heart was breaking
In hurried words, her name I blessed
I breathed the vows that bind me
And to my heart in anguish pressed
The girl I left behind me
Then to the south we bore away
To win a name in story
And there where dawns the sun of day
There dawned our sun of glory
Both blazed in noon on freedom's height
Where in the post assigned me
I shared the glory of that fight
Sweet girl I left behind me
Full many a name our banners bore
Of former deeds of daring
But they were days of seventy six
In which we had no sharing
But now our laurels freshly won
With the old ones shall entwine thee
Still worthy of our sires, each son
The hope of final victory
Within my bosom burning
Is mingling with sweet thoughts of thee
And of my fond returning
But should I ne'er return again
Still worth thy love thou't find me
Dishonors breath shall never stain
The name I left behind me

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - The Watermelon Song =====
Down in Tennessee I used to sit upon the fence
A-wonderin' about the lack of people's common sense
What I didn't understand then couldn't keep concealed
Was one great big fat watermelon layin' in the field
See that watermelon hangin' on the vine
I wish that watermelon could be mine
The farmer must be careless
Without a lick of sense
Or he wouldn't leave it hangin'
On the vine
Cornbread is sweet
Pork chops are good
Blackeyed peas are mighty, mighty fine
But give me, oh give me
I really wish you would
That watermelon hangin' on the vine
Got a gal who loves me
She always treats me fine
She lets hug and kiss her all the time
I wish that all her kisses
Could taste half as sweet
As the watermelon hangin' on the vine
Oh kissin' is sweet
Huggin' is good
Cherry lips taste mighty, mighty fine
Well I see that watermelon
So thick, so fat, so fine
What a shame to go leavin' it behind
I know my baby's waitin'
She won't be waitin' long
Now that I got that watermelon off the vine
Oh cornbread is sweet
But I ought to tell you
I really think I should
For lickin' good eatin'
Eat a watermelon hangin' on the vine

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - Hambone =====
Hambone! Hambone!
Hambone, hambone
Where you been?
Round the world and I'm going again
What you gonna do when you come back?
Take a little walk by the railroad track
Hambone
Have you heard?
Papa's gonna buy me a mocking bird
And if that mocking bird don't sing
Papa's gonna buy me a diamond ring
And if that diamond ring don't shine
Papa's gonna take it to the five and dime
I just skinned an alley cat
To make my wife a Sunday hat
Took the hide right off a goat
To make my wife a Sunday coat
Where's your wife
Out to the kitchen, cooking beans and rice
Trying to eat
Ketchup on his elbow, pickle on his feet
Bread in the basket
Chicken in the stew
Supper on the fire for me and you
Look at him holler, look at him moan
That hambone just can't hambone

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - The Shot Gun Boogie =====
There it stands in the corner with the barrel so straight
I looked out the winder and over the gate
The big fat rabbits are jumpin' in the grass
Wait 'till they hear my old shotgun blast
Shotgun boogie, I done saw your track
Look out Mr. Rabbit when I cock my hammer back
Well, over on the ridge is a scaly bark
Hickory nuts so big you can see'em in the dark
The big fat squirrels, they scratch and they fight
I'll be on that ridge before daylight
With a shotgun boogie, all I need is one shot
Look out bushy-tails, tonight you'll be in the pot
Well, I met a pretty gal, she was tall and thin
I asked her what she had, she said a Fox four-ten
I looked her up and down, said boy this is love
So we headed for the brush to shoot a big fat dove
Shotgun boogie, boy the feathers flew
Look out Mr. Dove when she draws a bead on you
I sat down on a log, took her on my lap
She said wait a minute bud, you got to see my pap
He's gotta sixteen gauge choked down like a rifle
He don't like a man that's gonna trifle
Shotgun boogie, draws a bead so fine
Look out big boy, he's loaded all the time
Well, I called on her pap like a gentleman oughter
He said no brush hunter's gonna get my daughter
He cocked back the hammer right on the spot
When the gun went off I outrun the shot
Shotgun boogie, I wanted weddin' bells
I'll be back little gal, when your pappy runs out of shells

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - The Bonnie Blue Flag =====
We are a band of brothers
And native to the soil
Fighting for the property
We gained by honest toil;
And when our rights were threatened
The cry rose near and far-
"Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star!"
Hurrah! Hurrah!
For Southern rights hurrah!
Hurrah for the Bonnie Blue Flag
That bears a single star
As long as the Union
Was faithful to her trust
Like friends and like brothers
Both kind were we and just;
But now, when Northern treachery
Attempts our rights to mar
We hoist on high the Bonnie Blue Flag
First gallant South Carolina
Nobly made the stand
Then came Alabama
Who took her by the hand
Next quickly Mississippi
Georgia and Florida
All raised on high the Bonnie Blue Flag
Ye men of valor, gather round
The banner of the right;
Texas and fair Louisiana
Join us in the fight
Davis, our loved president
And Stephens statesmen are;
Now rally round the Bonnie Blue Flag
And here's to old Virginia-
The Old Dominion State-
Who with the young Confederacy
At length has linked her fate;
Impelled by her example
Now other states prepare
To hoist on high the Bonnie Blue Flag
Then cheer, boys, cheer;
Raise the joyous shout
For Arkansas and North Carolina
Now have both gone out;
And let another rousing cheer
For Tennessee be given
The single star of the Bonnie Blue Flag
Has grown to be eleven
Then here's to our Confederacy
Strong are we and brave;
Like patriots of old we'll fight
Our heritage to save
And rather than submit to shame
To die we would prefer;
So cheer for the Bonnie Blue Flag

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - Dark as a Dungeon =====
Come listen you fellers, so young and so fine
And seek not your fortune in the dark dreary mines
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood is as black as the coal
It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
Where the danger is double and pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines
It's many a man I have known in my day
Who live just to labor his young life away
Where the dеmons of death often come by surprisе
One fall of a slate and you're buried alive
I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll
My body will blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones
Where danger is double and pleasures are few

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - River of No Return =====
There is a river called the river of no return
Sometimes it's peaceful and sometimes wild and free!
Love is a traveler on the river of no return
Swept on forever to be lost in the stormy sea
(Wail-a-ree) I can hear the river call (no return, no return)
Where the roarin' waters fall wail-a-ree
I can hear my lover call "Come to me" (no return, no return)
I lost my love on the river and forever my heart will yearn
Gone, gone forever down the river of no return
Wail-a-ree (Wail-a-ree), wail-a-ree
She'll never return to me! (no return, no return, no return)

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - Goober Peas =====
Sitting by the Roadside on a summer's day
Chatting with my messmates passing time away
Lying in the shadow underneath the trees
Goodness how delicious, eating goober peas!
Peas! Peas! Peas! Peas!
Eating goober peas!
Peas! Peas! Peas! Peas!
Delicious goober peas
When a horseman passes, the soldiers have a rule
To cry out at their loudest "Mister here's your mule"
But another pleasure enchantinger than these, is wearing out your Grinders, eating goober peas!
Just before the battle the General hears a row
He says "the Yanks are coming, I hear their rifles now"
He turns around in wonder, and what do you think he sees
The Georgia Militia, eating goober peas!
I think my song has lasted almost long enough
The subject's interesting, but rhymes are mighty rough
I wish this war was over when free from rags, and fleas
We'd kiss our wives and sweethearts, and gobble goober peas!

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - Marching Through Georgia =====
Bring the good old bugle boys, we'll sing another song!
Sing it with the spirit that will start the world along!
Sing it as we used to sing it, 50, 000 strong!
While we were marching through Georgia!
Hurrah! Hurrah! We bring the jubilee!
Hurrah! Hurrah! The flag that makes you free!
So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea!
There were many Union men who wept with joyful tears!
When they saw the honored flag they had not seen for years!
Hardly could they be restrained from breaking forth in cheers!
So we made a thoroughfare for Freedom and her train!
Sixty miles in latitude, three hundred to the Maine!
Treason fled before us for resistance was in vain!
While we were marching

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - My Task =====
To love someone more dearly every day
To help a wandering child to find his way
To ponder o'er a noble thought and pray (Ponder and pray)
And smile when evening falls
This is my task
To follow truth as blind men long for light
To do my best from dawn of day till night
To keep my heart fit for His holy sight
And answer when He calls
And then my Savior by and by to meet
When faith hath made her task on Earth complete
And lay my homage at the Master's feet
Within the jasper walls

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - The Army of the Free =====
In the army of the Union we are marching in the van
And will do the work before us, if the bravest soldiers
Can
We will drive the Rebel forces from their strongholds
To the sea
And will live and die together in the Army of the Free
We may rust beneath inaction, we may sink beneath
Disease
The summer sun may scorch us or the winter's blasts may
Freeze
But whatever may befall us, we will let the Rebels see
That unconquered we shall still remain the Army of the
Free
The Army of the Free, in the Army of the Free
We have Butterfield the daring and we've Martindale the
Cool
Where could we learn the art of war within a better
School
Add Morell to the list of names and we must all agree
We have the finest Generals in the Army of the Free
Then hurrah for our Division, may it soon be called to
Go
To add its strength to those who have advanced to meet
The foe
God bless it, for we know right well, wherever it may
Be
'Twill never fail to honor our great Army of the Free

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - Old Time Religion =====
Give me that old-time religion
It's good enough for me
It was good for our mothers
And it's good enough for me
It has served our fathers
Makes me love everybody
It will take us all to heaven
Repeat #1

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - Bringing In The Sheaves =====
Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness
Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve;
Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves
Refrain
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves
Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows
Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze;
By and by the harvest, and the labor ended
Going forth with weeping, sowing for the Master
Though the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;
When our weeping's over, He will bid us welcome

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - Mule Train =====
Mule train (giddyup, pah, giddahh) *whip* (heah)...*whip*
Mule train (yeah-ha) *whip*
Clippity-cloppin' *whip* over hill and plain
Seems as how they never stop
Clippity-clop, clippity-clop
Clippity-clippity, clippity-clippity
Clippity-cloppin' along
Mule train (eeh, heahy-ah) *whip...whip*
Mule train (weuh) *whip...whip*
Clippity-cloppin' on the mountain chain
Soon they're gonna reach the top
There's a plug o' chaw tebaccer for the miner in Corona
A guitar for a cowboy way out in Arizona
A dress o' calico for the pretty Navajo
Get along mule, get along
Mule train (gidda-ah) *whip...whip*
Mule train (yeuh) *whip*
Clippity- *whip* cloppin' through the wind and rain *whip*
A'keep 'em goin' 'til they drop
There's cotton thread 'n' needles for the folks way out yonder
A shovel for a miner who left his home to wander
Some rheumatism pills for the settlers in the hills
Mule train (I'll skin you, aeah) *whip...whip*
Mule train *whip...whip*

===== Tennessee Ernie Ford - Virginia’s Bloody Soil =====
Come all you loyal unionists, wherever you may be
I hope you'll pay attention and listen unto me
For well you know the blood and woe, the misery, the toil
It took to down secession on Virginia's bloody soil
When our good flag, the Stars and Stripes, from Sumter's walls was hurled
And high overhead on the forwardest walls the Rebel's flag unfurled
It aroused each loyal Northern man and caused his blood to boil
For to see that flag, Secession's rag, float o'er Virginia's soil
Then from the hills and mountain tops there came that wild alarm
Rise up ye gallant sons of North
Our country calls to arms
Come from the plains o'er hill and dale, ye hardy sons of toil
For our flag is trampled in the dust on Virginia's bloody soil
And thousands left their native homes, some never to return
And many's the wife and family dear were left behind to mourn
There was one who went among them who from danger would ne'er recoil
His bones lie bleaching on the fields of Virginia's bloody soil
When on the field of battle, he never was afraid
When cannons loud would rattle, he stood there
Undismayed
When bullets rained around him, he stood there with a
Smile
Saying, "We'll conquer, boys, or leave our bones on
Virginia's bloody soil"
In the great fight of the Wilderness, where many's the
Brave man fell
He boldly led his comrades on through Rebel shot and
Shell
The wounded 'round they strewed the ground; the dead
Lay heaped in piled
The comrades weltered in their blood on Virginia's
Bloody soil
The Rebels fought like fury, or tigers drove to bay
They knew full well, if the truth they'd tell, they could not win the day
It was hand to hand they fought 'em. The struggle was fierce and wild
Till a bullet pierced our captain's brain, on Virginia's bloody soil
But above that din of battle, what was that dreadful
Cry?
The woods are all afire, where our dead and wounded lie
The sight to behold next morning would make the stoutest heart recoil
To see the charred remains of thousands on Virginia's bloody soil
And now our hero's sleeping with thousands of the brave
No marble slab does mark the place that shows where he was laid
He died to save our Union
He's free of care and toil
Thank God
The Stars and Stripes still wave above Virginia's soil

===== Kenny Rogers - The Gambler =====
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice"
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, you gotta learn to play it right"
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done
Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep
And when he finished speakin', he turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words, I found an ace that I could keep
You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em)

===== Kenny Rogers - We've Got Tonight =====
I know it's late
I know you're weary
I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are
Both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry?
No one will care, girl
Look at the stars now, so far away
We've got tonight
Who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't you stay?
Deep in my soul
I feel so lonely
All of my hopes fading away
I've longed for love
Like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching after today
So there it is, girl
We've got it all now
And here we are, babe
What do you say?
We've got tonight, babe, why don't we stay?
I know it's late and I know you're weary
Both of us lonely, both of us lonely
Let's make it last
Let's find a way
Turn out the light, ohhh, come take my hand now

===== Kenny Rogers - Coward Of The County =====
Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong
He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
"Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun"
Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man
There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, n'there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace, took down his daddy's picture
As a tear fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again
Now it won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the barroom
One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor
Tommy turned around they said, "Hey look, old yella's leavin'"
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door
Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back, he let 'em have it all
When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, "This one's for Becky" as he watched the last one fall
N' I heard him say
I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek
And Papa, I sure hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man

===== Kenny Rogers - Lady =====
Lady
I'm your knight in shining armor
And I love you
You have made me what I am and I am yours
My love
There's so many ways I want to say
I love you
Let me hold you in my arms forever more
You have gone
And made me such a fool
I'm so lost in your love
And oh
We belong together
Won't you believe in my song
For so many years I thought
I'd never find you
You have come into my life and made me whole
Forever
Let me wake to see you
Each and every morning
Let me hear you whisper softly in my ear
In my eyes
I see no one else but you
There's no other love like our love
And yes
Oh yes, I'll always want you near me
I've waited for you for so long
Your love's the only love I need
And beside me
Is where I want you to be
'Cause my love
There's something I want you to know
You're the love of my life
You're my lady

===== Kenny Rogers - Through The Years =====
I can't remember when you weren't there
When I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do
Through the years, you've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you
Through the years, I've never been afraid
I've loved the life we've made and I'm so glad I've stayed
Right here with you through the years
I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, whom I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more
Through the years, through all the good and bad
I know how much we had
I've always been so glad to be with you
Through the years, it's better every day
You've kissed my tears away as long as it's okay
I'll stay with you through the years
Through the years, when everything went wrong
Together we were strong
I know that I belong right here with you
Through the years, I never had a doubt
We'd always work things out, I've learned what love's about
By loving you through the years

===== Kenny Rogers - You Decorated My Life =====
All my life was a paper once plain, pure and white
Till you moved with your pen changing moods now and then
Till the balance was right
Then you added some music, every note was in place
And anybody could see all the changes in me by the look on my face
And you decorated my life, created a world where dreams are a part
And you decorated my life by painting your love all over my heart
You decorated my life
Like a rhyme with no reason
In an unfinished song
There was no harmony, life meant nothin' to me, until you came along
And you brought out the colors
What a gentle surprise
Now I'm able to see, all the things life can be, shining soft in your eyes

===== Kenny Rogers - She Believes In Me =====
While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says, "How was your night?"
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight
And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows, maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way
While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
Then she says to wake her up when I am through
God, her love is true
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, while she lays, while she waits for me

===== Kenny Rogers - Lucille =====
In a bar in Toledo, across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer, so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her her name
When the drinks finally hit her, she said "I'm no quitter
But I finally quit living on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings"
In the mirror I saw him, and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman, who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused, he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking his big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said
"You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
With four hungry children and a crop in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time your hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille"
After he left us I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room to a rented hotel room
We walked without talking at all
She was a beauty, but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her, 'cause the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time
You picked a fine time to leave me Lucille
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

===== Kenny Rogers - Ruby Don't Take Your Love To Town =====
You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby, are you contemplating going out somewhere?
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is goin' down
Oh, Ruby
Don't take your love to town
It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
And yes, it's true, that I'm not the man I used to be
I still need some company
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman of your age
Ruby, I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say, until I'm not around
She's leavin' now 'cause I just heard the slammin' of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam 100 times before
And if I could move, I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
For God sake's, turn around

===== Kenny Rogers - Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer =====
Just look at you sitting there
You never looked better than tonight
And it would be so easy to tell you I'd stay
Like I've done so many times
I was so sure that this would be the night
You'd close the door and wanna stay with me
And it'd be so easy to tell you I'd wait
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't you fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Put out the light and just hold on
Before we say goodbye
Now it's morning, the phone rings
And you say you've gotta get your things together
You just gotta leave before you change your mind
And if you knew what I was thinking girl
I'd turn around if you'd just ask me one more time
Before we said goodbye
Goodbye

===== Kenny Rogers - Through The Years =====
I can't remember when you weren't there
When I didn't care for anyone but you
I swear we've been through everything there is
Can't imagine anything we've missed
Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do
Through the years, you've never let me down
You've turned my life around
The sweetest days I've found, I've found with you
Through the years, I've never been afraid
I've loved the life we've made and I'm so glad I've stayed
Right here with you through the years
I can't remember what I used to do
Who I trusted, whom I listened to before
I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more
Through the years, through all the good and bad
I know how much we had
I've always been so glad to be with you
Through the years, it's better every day
You've kissed my tears away as long as it's okay
I'll stay with you through the years
Through the years, when everything went wrong
Together we were strong
I know that I belong right here with you
Through the years, I never had a doubt
We'd always work things out, I've learned what love's about
By loving you through the years

===== Kenny Rogers - If I Ever Fall in Love Again =====
You, I know you're everything
That I've been looking for
And I, I look into your eyes
And could not ask for more
So it's only fair to lay it on the line
Hold on, I'm gonna need a little time
But if I ever fall in love again
Sometimes when this broken heart can mend
I know it's gonna be with you (it's gonna be with you)
You're the one to pull me through
Though I don't know when
If I ever fall in love again
Scared, I guess I'm scared to fly
It's such a long way down
And yet, if you'd just trust in me
I'm sure, I'd come around
And I know when you're hurt
It's hard to let someone inside (oh, woh)
In your arms I feel I'm ready now to try
Ohh wooh
So if I ever fall in love again
Sometimes when this broken heart can mend
I'd be a fool to ever let you go
You're the best thing in my life
When I know I gotta take it slow
Oh, I know it's gonna be with you (it's gonna be with you)

===== Kenny Rogers - Crazy =====
Girl, there are no words to say
What I feel in my heart
You, you're on my mind night and day
And it hurts me when we're apart
When you're not here by my side
There is nothing in this world for me
I guess I'm crazy, crazy for you, can't you see?
And although you may think it's crazy
Here is where I want to be
I will always need your love
Well now, I can see every dream
When I look in your eyes
And though, things never are what they seem
There is one thing that I realize
That there's no doubt in my mind
We can make this love go on forever
And although you may think I'm crazy
Here is where I'll always be
And I need you with me
'Cause you are the dream
That finally came true for me
And all my life there'll be no one else
If I looked all my life, there could be no one else
And for the rest of my life all I need is you

===== Kenny Rogers - You Can't Make Old Friends =====
What will I do when you are gone?
Who's gonna tell me the truth?
Who's gonna finish the stories I start
The way you always do?
When somebody knocks at the door
Someone new walks in
I will smile and shake their hands
But you can't make old friends
You can't make old friends
Can't make old friends
It was you and me, since way back when
How will I sing when you are gone?
Cause it won't sound the same
Who will join in on those harmony parts
When I call your name?
When Saint Peter opens the gate
And you come walking in
I will be there just waiting for you
Cause you can't make old friends
When I am out on the stage all alone
And I hear the music begin
We all know the show must go on
And you and me, will be young again
You and me, will be together again
Cause we both know, we will still be old friends
Not the way we have always been

===== Kenny Rogers - Buy Me A Rose =====
He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
A three car garage, her own credit cards
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
If he could only read her mind, she'd say
Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life
Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said:
And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives the more that he sees
This is a story of you and me
So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
Cause I'm gonna make things right
For the rest of your life
I'm gonna hold you tonight
Do all those little things

===== Kenny Rogers - Daytime Friends =====
And he'll tell her he's working late again
But she knows too well there's something going on
She's been neglected, and she needs a friend
So her trembling fingers dial the telephone
Lord, it hurts her doing this again
He's the best friend that her husband ever knew
When she's lonely, he's more than just a friend
He's the one she longs to give her body to
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go, what they do, in their secret hideaway
They don't want to hurt the others
So they love in the nighttime
And shake hands in the light of day
When it's over, there's no peace of mind
Just a longing for the way things should have been
And she wonders why some men never find
That a woman needs a lover and a friend

===== Kenny Rogers - You And I =====
All the man I am
You are the reason for me, you help me understand
I'll be your shelter from the rain that never ends
Girl, you've always got a friend in me
All the love we had
I should've known our love was older than the past
Throwing my life away on songs I never heard
Just the speaking of a special word
I made you die inside but you loved me
And don't believe the world
No, the world can't give us paradise
When you make your love to me
Til I just could not see the light
As long as I got you
As long as you got me
As long as we got you and I
I won't let you down
No better love will be there when you turn around
I'll be living for you till the ocean turns to sand
There will never be any man
Could love you just the way that I love you....
So don't believe the world
No the world can't give us paradise
In the eye within the storm
When I just could not make it through the night

===== Kenny Rogers - Mary, Did You Know? =====
Mary did you know that your baby boy
Will one day walk on water?
Will save our sons and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy
Has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered
Will soon deliver you
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will give sight to a blind man?
Will calm a storm with his hand?
Has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss your little baby
You've kissed the face of God
Oh, Mary did you know
Ooh...
The blind will see
The deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the lamb
Is Lord of all creation?
Will one day rule the nations?
Did you know that your Baby Boy
Is Heaven's perfect Lamb?
This sleeping child you're holding
Is the great I am

===== Kenny Rogers - Reuben James =====
Reuben James, in my song you live again
And the phrases that I rhyme are just a footstep out of time
From the time when I knew you, Reuben James
Reuben James, all the folks around Madison County
Cussed your name
You're just a no-count, sharecropping colored man
Who'd steal anything you can
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James
Reuben James, for you still walk over fields of my mind
Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow
Loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James
For a grave, the gossiper of Madison County died with child
Although your skin was black
You were the one that didn't turn your back
On the hungry white child with no name, Reuben James
Reuben James, with your mind on the soul
And a Bible in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek
For there's a better world awaiting for the meek
In my mind, these words remain from Reuben James
Reuben James, one dark cloudy day
They brought you from the field
And to your lonely pine box
Came just a preacher, me and the rain
Just to sing one last refrain to Reuben James

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Family Tradition =====
Country music singers have always been a real close family
But lately some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me
I guess it's because I kind of changed my direction
Lord, I guess I went and broke their family tradition
They get on me, they wanna know
"Hank, why do you drink, Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?"
Over and over, everybody made my prediction
So, if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition
I am very proud of my daddy's name
Although his kind of music and mine ain't exactly the same
Stop and think it over, put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long, it's a family tradition
So don't ask me
If I'm down in a honky-tonk and some ol' slick's trying to give me friction
I say, "Leave me alone, I'm singing all night long, it's a family tradition"
Lordy, I have loved some ladies, and I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 1973
When that doctor asked me, "Son, how'd you get in this condition?"
I said, "A-hey, Sawbones, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition"
Stop and think it over, try to put yourself in my unique position

===== Hank Williams Jr. - A Country Boy Can Survive =====
The preacher man says it's the end of time
And the Mississippi River, she's a-goin' dry
The interest is up and the stock market's down
And you only get mugged if you go downtown
I live back in the woods, you see
My woman and the kids and the dogs and me
I got a shotgun, a rifle and a 4-wheel drive
And a country boy can survive, country folks can survive
I can plow a field all day long
I can catch catfish from dusk 'til dawn
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too
Ain't too many things these old boys can't do
We grow good ol' tomatoes and homemade wine
Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
'Cause we're them old boys raised on shotguns
We say grace, and we say ma'am
If you ain't into that, we don't give a damn
We came from the West Virginia coal mines
And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies
And we can skin a buck, we can run a trotline
I had a good friend in New York City
He never called me by my name, just "Hillbilly"
My grandpa taught me how to live off the land
And his taught him to be a businessman
He used to send me pictures of the Broadway nights
And I'd send him some homemade wine
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife
For 43 dollars, my friend lost his life
I'd love to spit some Beech-Nut in that dude's eyes
Then shoot him with my old .45
'Cause a country boy can survive, country folks can survive
'Cause you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
We're from north California and south Alabam'
And little towns all around this land
And we can skin a buck, and run a trotline
A country boy can survive
Country folks can survive

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Dinosaur =====
Hey man, them ain't high heel sneakers
And they sure don't look like cowboy boots
And that ain't rock and roll you're playin'
And it sure ain't country or rhythm and blues
You're singin' a song about makin' love to your drummer
Well, gay guitar pickers don't turn me on
And we don't all get into Donna Summer
Do you happen to know any ol' Hank Williams songs?
'Cause you see I'm a dinosaur
I should have died out a long time before
Have pity on a dinosaur
Hand me my hat, excuse me man, but where's the door?
Used to be I had a lot of fun in this old hangout
We'd get stoned at the jukebox and stay out of fights
Now and then, light a little smoke in the truck out back
Then a little old Jim Beam and we'd get right
And you know these flashin' lights sure make me dizzy
And this disco's very strange to my ears
It looks like they've turned the Longhorn into a spaceship
And I'll be leavin' just as soon as I finish this beer
Should have died out a long time before
There's a whole lot of dinosaurs
So give us our hats, excuse me man, but where's the door?
Get us our hats
Excuse me, man
But where's the door?

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Whiskey Bent And Hell Bound =====
I've got a good woman at home who thinks I do no wrong
But sometimes, Lord, she just ain't always around
And you know that's when I fall, now I can't help myself at all
And I get whiskey bent and hell bound
Play me some songs about a ramblin' man
Put a cold one in my hand
'Cause you know I love to hear those guitar sounds
Don't you play "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"
'Cause I'll get all balled up inside
And I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound
Sure enough about closin' time, 'bout stoned out of my mind
And I end up with some honky tonk special I found
Just as sure as the morning sun comes, thinking of my sweet girl at home
And I need to get whiskey bent and hell bound
Play me the songs about ramblin' man
Put old Jim Beam in my hand
'Cause you know I still love to get drunk and hear country sounds
But don't play "Your Cheatin' Heart"
'Cause that'll tear me all apart
I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound
Yeah, old Hank's songs always make me feel low down

===== Hank Williams Jr. - All My Rowdy Friends (Have Settled Down) =====
All my rowdy friends have settled down
And they seem to be more into laid back songs
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
Everybody just wants to go back home
I, myself, have seen my wilder days
And I have seen my name at the top of the page
But I need to find a friend just to run around
But nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a "Lost Highway"
And old George Jones, I'm glad to see, is finally getting straight
And Waylon's staying home and loving Jessi more these days
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
Ow!
And the hangovers hurt more than they used to
And corn bread and ice teas took the place of pills and 90-proof
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do
And nobody wants to get high on the town
Yeah, I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a "Lost Highway"
And Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68
And Kris, he is a movie star and he's moved off to L.A..
Yeah, me and my rowdy friends done rowdied on down

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Weatherman =====
Mr. Weatherman
What is your forecast?
I need a major change
I can't stand no more rain
Everything's been goin' wrong
Please, tell me it's something in the ozone
Or is the atmospheric pressure just too strong?
I can't ride out one more storm
'Cause I've had too many highs and too many lows
Too many storms and tornadoes
I need some blue skies and sunshine
I need a good forecast tonight
I need a good outlook tonight
Hope your weekend forecast is bright
Hope you got me on your weather eye

===== Hank Williams Jr. - All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight =====
I got ketchup on my blue jeans, I just burned my hand
Lord, it's hard to be a bachelor man
I've got girls that can cook, I've got girls that can clean
I've got girls that can do anything in between
I've got to get ready, make everything right
'Cause all my rowdy friends are coming over tonight
Do you want to drink? Hey, do you want to party?
Hey, honey, this is ol' Hank ready to get the thing started
We cooked a pig in the ground, we got some beer on ice
And all my rowdy friends are coming over tonight
Now my party pad is out in the woods
It's a long, long way from here to Hollywood
But I got some natural queens out on the floor
And ole Miss Mississippi just walked through the door
I got a little whirlpool just made for ten
And you can jump out, and you can jump in
You can do anything that you want to do
But uh-uh, don't you step on my cowboy boots
Hey, honey, this is ol' Hank ready to get the summer started
Hey, hey, this is rockin' Randall Hank
Ready to get the summertime started
That's right
Come on in

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Outlaw Women =====
She works in a bank and she works in a store
And she don't go for that old stuff anymore
She likes to get high and listen to the band
She likes to make love to her kind of man
These outlaw women, first of their kind
Outlaw women, they got you right on time
Outlaw women don't need any guns
Outlaw women, just out of fun
In a way she's a lot like me
She don't give a damn 'bout society
Might be little rich girl, she might be poor
Might be a married woman that needs a little more
She's a outlaw woman, first of the kind
These outlaw women, ridin' high in '79
These outlaw women, don't need any guns
These outlaw women, just out of fun

===== Hank Williams Jr. - O.D.'d In Denver =====
We started the tour out in Denver Colorado
I made the first one but I did not make the second show
'Cause I met this girl there that brought about quite a big change
But I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
I guess you could say that my love life would not up to par
Too many nights alone had left some permanent scars
She told me she'd love me and I told her I'd do the same
Then I OD'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name
I brought it on myself and I guess that I shouldn't complain
Doc said, "Son, you can't do anymore of that cocaine"
But she made me higher than all of those expensive things
But I OD'd in Denver and wish I could remember her name
I turned to other things tryin' to make my daydreams real
But they don't take the place of the woman's face and her feel
She treated me nice and I'd like to find her again
Kinda overdid it in Denver and I just can't remember her name

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Country State Of Mind =====
That hot old summer sun make you beg for your next breath
So you best be on the creek bank, laid in the shade
Chewin' on a hickory twig, pass that bottle, I'll have me a swig
I ain't got a lot, but I think I got it made in the shade
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind
Catchin' these fish like they're goin' out of style, drinkin' this homemade wine
Hey, if the sun don't come up tomorrow, people, I've had a good time
I bet the old man's in the kitchen, he's got my kind of music on his radio
Oh, drinkin' his beer and dialin' up the request lines
Mama and old Aunt Joan probably in the dinin' room tryin' to use the phone
Me, I'm thinkin' about that girl and later tonight
Hey, I'm catchin' these fish like they're goin' out of style, I'm drinkin' this homemade wine
And if the sun don't come up tomorrow, people, I've had a good time
You know, the rednecks and the preppies, they're in their discos and honky-tonks
Somewhere between raisin' hell and amazin' grace
Lord, I know just how they feel, you gotta get out and kick up your heels
And ain't it great to be livin' in the U.S.A
Me, I'm laid up here in a country state of mind
Catchin' these fish like they're goin' out of style, drinkin' this homemade wine, all the time
If the sun don't shine tomorrow, people, I have had a good time
Yodel-ay-ee-oh, del-ay-ee-oh, del-ay

===== Hank Williams Jr. - The Conversation =====
Hank, let's talk about your daddy
Tell me how your mama loved that man
Well just break out a bottle, Hoss
I'll tell you about the driftin' cowboy band
We won't talk about the habits
Just the music and the man
That's all
Now Hank, if you just got to tell me
Did your daddy really write all them songs, did he?
That don't deserve no answer, hossL
Et's light up and just move along
Do you think he wrote 'em about your mama
Or about the man who done her wrong?
You know that
Well back then they called him crazy
Nowadays they call him a saint
Now the ones that called him crazy
Are still ridin' on his name
Well if he was here right now, Bocephus
Would he think that we were right, do you think he might?
Don't you know he would, Watasha
Be right by our side
If we left for a show in Provo
He'd be the first one on the bus and ready to ride
"I just wanna go hoss!"
Wherever he is I hope he's happy
And I hope he's doin' well, yes I do
He is, 'cause he's got one arm around my mama now
How he sure did love Miss Audrey and raisin' hell
I won't ask you no more questions
To the stories only Hank could tell
Most folks don't know that they fired him from the Opry
And that caused him the greatest pain
I loved to tell you about lovesick
And how Miss Audrey loved that man
You know I've always loved to listen
To the stories about that driftin' cowboy band, yes man
You know when we get right down to it
Still the most wanted outlaws in the land

===== Hank Williams Jr. - The American Way =====
If you fly in from Birmingham
You'll get the last gate
If you blew in from Boston
No, you sure won't have to wait
And I'm learnin' a little more every day
Aww, 'bout the power of the dollar
And the people with white collars
And the good old American way
I've noticed I don't get much help
When they see my blue jeans
Some slick with a suit walks up
"Oh, can I help you, please?"
Yes, I'm learnin' as I gain a little age
Some high society lady says
"Is your horse outside?"
"No, ma'am he's between my legs
But you're too fat to ride!"
And you're learnin' a little more about my ways
And what I think about your dollar
And your white collar
And your good old American way
If you don't like my Nudie boots
I'm sorry about that
Don't make fun of my hat too
Or you might get knocked flat
And you'll learn some more if you ever pass down our way
Aww, 'bout the folks without the dollars
And without white collars
Hell, they are the American way

===== Hank Williams Jr. - There's A Tear In My Beer =====
There's a tear in my beer
'Cause I'm crying for you, dear
You are on my lonely mind
Into these last nine beers
I have shed a million tears
I'm going to keep drinking until I'm petrified
And then maybe these tears will leave my eyes
Last night I walked the floor
And the night before
It seems my life is through
And I'm so doggone blue
I'm going to keep drinking til I can't move a toe
And then maybe my heart won't hurt me so
'Cause I'm crying for you dear
Lord, I've tried and I've tried
But my tears I can't hide
All these blues that I've found
Have really got me down
I'm going to keep drinking til I can't even think
Cause in the last week I ain't slept a wink

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Born To Boogie =====
Well, my mama met my daddy down in Alabam'
They tied the knot so here I am
Born on the bayou on the Texas line
Loved in Louisiana and raised on Jambalaya
Now before I could walk, I had a guitar in my hand
By the time I could talk, I had my own band
I went on the road when I was eight years old
When I turned fifteen, I was stealing the show
Money to burn and the girls were pretty
It didn't take me long to learn that I was born to boogie
When I was eighteen, I went to Hollywood
I met Elvis and Marilyn and Johnny B. Goode
Got my guitar painted and some California sun
A red Cadillac, having too much fun
Now we were playing them halls and jamming then
And we moved it on over to MGM
They said, "This is the boy we've been telling you about"
He lit a cigar and stuck his hand out
He said, "Son, have we got a deal for you
I'm gonna make you a star
Give you fifty thousand too"
I told him, "My Momma didn't raise no fool"
"I'll take your money, I'll make your movie
I'll tell you right now I was born to boogie"
Well my name is Bocephus, I drink whiskey by the gallon
And I never back down and I love a good challenge
What I do now is what I did then
I like to get down with all my rowdy friends
Now I can be sweet and I can be mean
I still got my hat and I still wear my jeans
My shades are chrome, my guitar is steel
If you think I won't then believe me I will
Get down on you, baby, 'cause I ain't no rookie
I was put here to party and I was born to boogie

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Ballad Of Hank Williams =====
Don, tell us how it really was when you was workin' with daddy
Well, in 1950 I took a little nip
Along with Mr. Williams on the way to Mississipp'
We was stacked eight deep in a Packard limousine
And we met this promoter in the town of New Orleans
Well, the man told daddy that he had what it took
And he liked the way he sang and he liked the way he shook
He said pretty soon he'd make us all rich
And we started believin' that fat sum bitch
Now daddy told the man if you wanna make some dough
Take a little money and book me on a show
And we played them dates and we filled the places well
But, Hank, he'd done blowed the profits all to hell
'Cause he'd run through a ten and he'd run through a twenty
And he'd run through a hundred just as fast as it could go
Like a big dose of sauce to a little bitty feller
He'd spend a thousand dollars on a hundred dollar show
Hank looked at me with a funny lookin' grin
Said, "I've been to the Opry and I'm goin' back again"
We met the owner in a little office there
A big fat fella with some artificial hair
He told Hank, he wanted half of everything he made
Or he'd have to tell Audrey 'bout some women Hank had laid
And you told daddy he'd better get smart
Get rid of them fellas and make a new start
Then he fired my ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
And he fired everybody just as hard as he could go
He fired old Cedric and he fired Sammy Pruitt
And he fired some people that he didn't even know
Well, every song he made, it went to number one
Y'all was workin' like hell and he was havin' fun
We was ridin' every day and playin' every night
And every twenty minutes some of us had a fight
Now, daddy he was makin' money hand over fist
And y'all was gettin' screwed but you wasn't gettin' kissed
Yeah, I told him to pass a little bit around
But he said he'd rather send it to his folks in Alabam'
So he fired your ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
Now the owner of the Opry, he's a-doin' pretty good
He's got a music company that they call Cedarwood
And Hank played nothin' but sold out halls
And I was pumpin' gas in greasy overalls
'Cause he fired my ass and he fired Jerry Rivers
Hank run through a fifty and he'd run through a hundred
And he'd run through a thousand just as hard as he could go
Buyin' Cadillac Coupes, payin' double alimony
Don, you know, you used to work for me one time
I sure remember that, but come to think of it you fired my ass back in 1972
Oh, well, it's a family tradition ya know?
Yep, yep, yep
But I kept Jerry Rivers
Right, right

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Attitude Adjustment =====
Now I met an old friend in the bar the other night
And he got a little drunk and he wanted to fight
And he jumped up and challenged every man in the room
And just about the time he got the words out
An ol' boy jumped up and closed his mouth
And used his head for a mop and his butt for a broom
It was an attitude adjustment, I guess it was his first time
An attitude adjustment, now he understands just fine
He got bent out of shape and he opened his mouth
And just one appointment straightened him right out
It was an attitude adjustment, it'll work every time
I've got this big ol' brother-in-law
And me and him just never did get along
'Cause he wants to make sure I'm treating his sister right
He got drunk one night, started beating me up
And I went and got a tire tool out of my truck
And laid him out as cold as a block of ice
It was an attitude adjustment and it will work every time
An attitude adjustment, I made him see the light
And he says I'm his kind of man
And he comes around with his hat in his hand
It was an attitude adjustment, I cured all his family pride
Now my girlfriend slapped me in the face
I said, "Darlin', that was you're first mistake"
Then she went wild and her eyes turned red
She started breaking everything and sceaming loud
And kickin' me and cussin' me out
And I gave her a little adjustment on the top of the head
It was an attitude adjustment, now she loves on me all the time
Just an attitude adjustment, she got a whole new frame of mind
She don't nag, I don't beg
We get along and like I said
Just an attitude adjustment, oh, everythings just fine (Well, almost)
She called the cops to take me in
And I said, "You're never gonna do it, friends"
And they just smiled and said, "Oh, yes we will"
Now a stick to the head and some kicks to the shins
And several bites by Rin-Tin-Tin
And I couldn't wait to get into that jail
It was an attitude adjustment, oh, I went along peacefully
Attitude adjustment, they made me clearly see
'Cause my head is black and my legs are blue
And both kneecaps are bit clean through
It was an attitude adjustment, it made my whole life look brand new
Just an attitude adjustment, it made my whole life look brand new

===== Hank Williams Jr. - God And Guns =====
Last night I heard this politician
Talkin' 'bout a brand new mission
Liked his plan, but it came undone
When it got around to God & guns
Well, I don't know how he grew up
But it sure wasn't down at the huntin' club
'Cause if it was he'd understand
Just a little bit more about the workin' man
God & guns keep us strong
That's what this country was founded on
Well, we might as well give up and run
If we let 'em take our God & guns
That ain't gon' happen
Out here in my neck of the woods
Where God is great and guns are good
You really can't know that much about 'em
If you think we're better off without 'em
There was a time we ain't forgot
You could rest all night with your doors unlocked
But there ain't nobody safe no more
So you say your prayers and you thank the Lord
For that peace maker '38 in the dresser drawer, yeah
God & guns keep us strong (Keep us strong)
If we let 'em take our God & our guns
Yeah, we might as well give up and run
That ain't happenin', baby
Got a shotgun rifle and a four-wheel drive
God & guns
A country boy can survive
Don't let 'em take
Don't let 'em take our God & guns
God & guns, yeah, keeps us strong
I don't think so

===== Hank Williams Jr. - I've Got Rights =====
I went down to the Mary Carter paint store
I said, "Give me one of them Smith & Wesson Magnum .44s"
'Cause there's a man that the law let loose and justice was not done
This man, he killed my wife and my only little son
I'll never forget the way he looked all through the trial
He had his big-name lawyer and he had that smirky smile
Woah, yeah, he got you off on a technicality
But you have to grow wings and fly to ever get away from me
'Cause I got rights, I got rights too
And this time there won't be no damn lawyers and systems to protect you
But I'm gonna read you, I'm gonna read you your rights
You got a right to know that you gonna go to hell one of these black nights
And when the trial was over, he had the nerve to say, "That's the way it goes"
I said, "Well, Hoss, you'd better get you some corks, 'cause you're gonna have to plug up a few holes"
Guess he thought I was talkin' just to pass away time
But he kinda looks different now on his knees, beggin' for his life
Hey, I got rights, I got some rights too
Because I want you to know that you're gonna go to hell one of these black nights
Naw, and this time there ain't no damn lawyers and systems to save you

===== Hank Williams Jr. - The Blues Man =====
I'm just a singer, a natural-born guitar ringer
Kind of a clinger to sad old songs
I'm not a walk-behinder, I'm a new note finder
But my name's a reminder of a blues man that's already gone
So I started drinkin', took things that messed up my thinkin'
I was sure sinkin' when you came along
I was alone in the hot lights, not too much left in sight
But she changed all that one night when she sang me this song
"Hey baby, I love you, hey baby, I need you
Hey baby, you ain't got to prove to me you're some kind of macho man
You've wasted so much of your life, runnin' through the dark nights
Let me shine some love light, down on the blues man"
I got so sick from speedin', all the stuff they said I wasn't needin'
If I was to keep pleasin' all of my fans
I got cuffed on dirt roads, I got sued over no-shows
But she came and took all that old load down off this blues man
Hey baby, I love you too, hey baby, I need you
Hey baby, I do get tired of this travelin' band
I'm 30 years old now, nights would be cold now
If you hadn't stuck it out with this blues man
I'm 30 years old now, nights sure would be cold now
If you hadn't hung around with this blues man

===== Hank Williams Jr. - Kaw-Liga =====
Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian standin' over by the door
Fell in love with a Choctaw maid over in the Georgia store
Kaw-Liga, ooh, standin' there, don't never let it show
She don't ever answer, yes or no
He always wore his Sunday feathers and carried his old blackhawk
Maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga, ooh, standin' there, don't never show a sign
'Cause his heart is made of knotty pine
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you ain't never got a kiss
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you don't know what you what miss
Is it any wonder that your face is red?
Kaw-Liga, you poor old wooden head
Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian, never went nowhere
Heart was set on the Choctaw maid wearin' the long, black hair
'Cause his heart was made of knotty pine
And then one day, a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
Took her oh so far away and ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
Kaw-Liga, ooh, standin' there, as lonesome as can be
Ah, just wishin' he were still an ol' pine tree
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, you just ain't never had no kissin'
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, hoss, you don't know what you're missin'
Is it any wonder, that your face is red?
Kaw-Liga, you poor, ol' wooden head
Just a head
