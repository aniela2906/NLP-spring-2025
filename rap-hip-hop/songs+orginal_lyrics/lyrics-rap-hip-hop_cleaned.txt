===== 50 cent - Candy Shop =====
Yeah, uh-huh
So seductive

I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' 'till you hit the spot, woah
I'll take you to the candy shop (Yeah)
Boy, one taste of what I got (Uh-huh)
I'll have you spendin' all you got (Come on)
Keep goin' 'til you hit the spot, woah

You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gon' back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature risin', okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm tryin' to explain, baby, the best way I can
I'll melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand, ha-ha

I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' 'til you hit the spot, woah
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste of what I got

Keep goin' 'til you hit the spot, woah

Girl, what we do (What we do)
And where we do (And where we do)
The things we do (Things we do)
Are just between me and you, yeah (Oh yeah)

Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door, she get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race, who could get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
On my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone

I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' 'til you hit the spot, woah
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste of what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep goin' 'til you hit the spot, woah
I'll take you to the candy shop

Go 'head, girl, don't you stop
Keep goin' 'til you hit the spot, woah
I'll take you to the candy shop
Boy, one taste of what I got
I'll have you spendin' all you got
Keep goin' 'til you hit the spot, woah

===== 50 cent - Window Shopper =====
Ohh!
The top feel so much better than the bottom
So much better
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryna get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

Summertime, white Porsche Carrera is milky
I'm on the grind, let my paper stack but I'm filthy
It's funny how niggas get to screw-facin' at me
Anyhow they ain't got the heart to get at me
I'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from
So I don't cruise through nobody hood without my gun
They know the kid ain't goin' for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you don' fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right
When we got the tops, down, you can hear the systems thump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Shut your block, down, quick to put a hole in a chump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'

Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryna get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

Niggas love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come to scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts, some from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp, mane
Tell her, "Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang."
She can bring the lingerie wit her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane
Listen mane, shit, changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang
Homie, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh shit, mane, the store owner watchin' you
'Fore somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen

Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Nigga, you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryna get a test drive
Nigga, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

===== 50 cent - Best Friend =====
Yeah!
It's my tape, man
Listen to my tape
(I've waited
I've waited
Time went by
But all I could do is cry
Silly, silly) Woo!

If I was your best friend
I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl, promise you'll be mine)
He say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now girl, let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha ha)
He say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend
I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend

Now girl, let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha ha)
He say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

First we get to talkin', then we get to touchin'
If we get past the phone games, we'll be fuckin'
I kiss like the French do, I put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it, girl, and pull on your hair
For me, a different scenery just means a different position
In the tub or on the sink, I improvise, now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile-high club
I'm no fool, I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin' special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back, I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin', I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin' why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin', it don't mean that I'm shy
Got on that shit that you picked out for me, that's why I'm so fly

If I was your best friend
I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl, promise you'll be mine)
He say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now girl, let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha ha)
He say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend
I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl, promise you'll be mine)
He say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now girl, let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha ha)
He say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

While you in your bubble bath, I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin' on your lotion, I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin', I could change how you walk
That's the swagger that you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler, I just hustle and the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin' you, I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets, girl, you know that's right
I ain't got nothin' to hide, baby, I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein' 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before

If I was your best friend
I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl, promise you'll be mine)
He say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now girl, let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha ha)
He say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend
I want you 'round all the time
(I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl, promise you'll be mine)
He say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
Now girl, let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha ha)

Goddamn, damn

She, she, she want it, I wanna give it to her
She know that it's right here for her
I wanna see her break it down (Yeah)
I'm ballin', throwing money 'round

She a working girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She fine as hell, she 'bout the dough
She doing her thing out on the floor
Her money-money, she make it, make it
Look at the way she shake it, shake it
Make you wanna touch it, make you wanna taste it
Have you lusting for it, going crazy, face it
Now don't stop, get it, get it
The way she shake it make you wanna hit it
Think she double-jointed from the way she split it
Got your head fucked up from the way she did it
She so much more than you used to
She know just how to move to seduce you
She gon' do the right thing and touch the right spots
And dance in your lap 'til you ready to pop

She always ready, when you want it, she want it
Like a nympho, the info, I'll show you where to meet her
On the late night, 'til daylight, the club jumping
If you want a good time, she gon' give you what you want
Let me talk to you

Baby, you're so new-age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?

You got me saying, "Ayo!" I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo! I'm tired of using technology

Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it

Got a thing for that thing she got
The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that—that there should be 'gainst the law

From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I'll do to you
Let's get it poppin', shawty, we could switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
Let me talk to you

Baby, you're so new-age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice, baby

You can stunt if you want and your ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11 (Yeah)
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend

It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit, spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot

See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50, man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

You know you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house (Yeah)
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face (Uh-huh)
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you're makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper (Uh-huh)
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper (Flipper)
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icy
I'm down to sell records, but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94, "We don't love them hoes"

Ooh, I need you
Like the fire needs the air
I won't burn unless you're there, you're there
Ooh, I need you

Yeah, I need you, I need you to hate

You know, it's real shit, feel this

America got a thing for this gangster shit, they love me
Black Chukkas, black skully, leather Pelle Pelle
I tag SPIT over Ramo's shit, I'm a vandal
Got that silver duct tape on my trey-eight handle
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in "New Jack," I holla "Cancel that bitch!"
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold, man my heart done froze
I built an empire on the low, the NARC's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know?
Homie, I'm just triple beam, dreaming, niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiendin'
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me

I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics, I somersault bricks
And black talons start flying when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my co-d's call me Chef Boyar-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed, shit
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need
Them ain't Chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm selling them for 500 a pop, goddamn it
I sell anything, I'm a hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes, put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man

I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

It's the Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'
The drama means nothing, it's part of the game
Catch me in the coupé switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty "BS" to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me
Racist, pointing at me, "Look at Niggaraci" - hello

I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from

Let's make it

You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothin'
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'

You ain't a friend of mine (Yeah!), you ain't no kin of mine (C'mon!)

An ass like that gotta be one of a kind (Woo)

I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine

Niggas sayin' they gon' murk 50, how?

===== 50 cent - What Up Gangsta =====
G-Unit (Buck), we in here (Buck)
We could get the drama poppin', we don't care (Buck, buck, buck)
It's going down (Buck), 'cause I'm around (Buck)
50 Cent, you know how I gets down (Down)

What up, blood? (What?) What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?) What up, gangsta?
What up, blood? (What?) What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?) What up, gangsta?
They say I walk around like I got a S on my chest
Nah, that's a semi-auto and a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothin' the DA might wanna play in court
But I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport
Front on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you
You gettin' money, I can't get none with ya, then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for DWI
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit, them, they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred Gs, I stash it (What?), the MAC, I blast it (Yeah)
Ds come, we dump the diesel in battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice, I flash it
Jux me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard
I'm on the next level, Breitling baguette bezel
Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle

Blood (What?), what up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?) What up, gangsta?
What up, blood? (What?) What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?) What up, gangsta?
We don't play that, we don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit), we don't play around

I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder
When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?
When the fifth kick, duck quick, it sound like thunder
In December, I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat's my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path, I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches
Industry hoes fuck us, in the hood, they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas

What up, blood? (What?) What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?) What up, gangsta?
What up, blood? (What?) What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?) What up, gangsta?

We don't play that, we don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit), we don't play around
We don't play that, we don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit), we don't play around
We don't play that, we don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit), we don't play around
We don't play that, we don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit), we don't play around

Girl, we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small

Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head

Catch a date, suck a dick, shit (Trick)

Pockets full of cheese, bitch, I got racks

Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade, I got caught with a pistol
Sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade, started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field

===== Beastie Boys - Sabotage =====
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'ma set it straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fucking thorn in my side
Oh my god, it's a mirage
I'm telling y'all, it's sabotage

So, so, so, so listen up, 'cause you can't say nothing
You'll shut me down with a push of your button
But, yo, I'm out, and I'm gone
I'll tell you now, I keep it on and on

'Cause what you see, you might not get
And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
Scheming on a thing, that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage

Listen, all y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen, all y'all, it's a sabotage

What could it be? It's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage

===== Beastie Boys - No Sleep Till Brooklyn =====
No sleep 'til
Brooklyn

Foot on the pedal, never ever false metal
Engine runnin' hotter than a boiling kettle
My job ain't a job, it's a damn good time
City to city, I'm a-runnin' my rhymes
On location, tourin' around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger, but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because I'm illin' and able
Ain't no fakin', your money I'm takin'
Goin' coast to coast to watch all the girlies shakin'
While you're at the job workin' nine-to-five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kickin' it live

No sleep 'til

Another plane, another train, another bottle in the brain
Another girl, another fight, another drive all night

Our manager's crazy, he always smokes dust
He's got his own room at the back of the bus
Tour around the world, you rock around the clock
Plane to hotel, girls on the jock
We're trashin' hotels like it's goin' out of style
Gettin' paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while
Four on the floor, Ad-Rock's out the door
MCA's in the back 'cause he's skeezin' with a whore
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back
White boys got more rhymes

No sleep 'til
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn

Ain't seen the light since we started this band
So, MCA, get on the mic, my man

Born and bred in Brooklyn, USA
They call me Adam Yauch, but I'm MCA
Like a lemon to a lime, a lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women
Limos, arenas, and TV shows
Autographed pictures and classy hoes
Step off, Holmes, get out of my way
Taxin' little girlies from here to LA
Wakin' up before I get to sleep
'Cause I'll be rockin' this party eight days a week

No sleep 'til
No sleep 'til Brooklyn

Brass Monkey, that funky monkey
Brass Monkey junkie, that funky monkey
Brass

Got this dance that's more than real
Drink Brass Monkey, here's how you feel
You put your left leg down, your right leg up
Tilt your head back, let's finish the cup
MCA with the bottle, D rocks the can
Ad-Rock gets nice with Charlie Chan
We're offered Moët, we don't mind Chivas
Wherever we go, we bring the Monkey with us
Ad-Rock drinks three, Mike D is D
Double R foots the bill most definitely
I drink Brass Monkey, and I rock well
I got a castle in Brooklyn, that's where I dwell

Brass Monkey, that funky monkey
Brass Monkey junkie, that funky Monkey
Brass

Because
'Cause I drink it anytime and any place
When it's time to get ill, I pour it on my face
Monkey tastes def when you pour it on ice
Come on, y'all, it's time to get nice
Coolin' by the lockers, gettin' kind of funky
Me and the crew, we're drinkin' Brass Monkey
This girl walked by, she gave me the eye
I reached in the locker, grabbed the Spanish fly
I put it in the Monkey, mixed it in a cup
Went over to the girl, "Yo baby, what's up?"
I offered her a sip (Sip), the girl, she gave me lip (Lip)
It did begin, the stuff wore in, and now she's on my tip

Brass Monkey, that funky monkey
Brass Monkey junkie, that funky monkey
Brass

Step up to the bar, and put the girl down
She takes a big gulp and slaps it around
You take a sip, you can do it, you get right to it
We had a case in the place, and then we went right through it
You got a dry martini, you thinkin' you're cool
I'll take your place at the bar, I smack you off your stool
I'll down a 40 dog in a single gulp
And if you got beef, you'll get beat to a pulp
Monkey and parties and reelin' and rockin'
Def-def girls-girls, all y'all jockin'
The song and dance keepin' you in a trance
If you don't buy my record, I got my advance
I drink it, I think it, I see it, I be it
I love Brass Monkey but I don't give D it
We got the bottle, you got the cup
Come on, everybody, let's get ffffff--

===== Beastie Boys - Girls =====
Girls!
All I really want is (Girls!)
And in the morning it's (Girls!)
'Cause in the evening it's (Girls!)

I like the way that they walk
And it's chill to hear them talk
And I can always make 'em smile
From White Castle to the Nile

Back in the day (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
There was this girl around the way (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
She liked my home-piece MCA (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
He said he would not give her play (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I asked him, "Please?"; he said, "You may" (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
Her pants were tight, and that's ok (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
If she would dance, I would DJ (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
We took a walk down to the bay

I hope she'll say (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
"Hey, me and you should hit the hay!" (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I asked her out, she said, "No way!"(bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I should've probably guessed her gay (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
So I broke north with no delay (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I heard she moved real far away (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
That was two years ago this May (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I seen her just the other day
Jockin' Mike D to my dismay

(Girls!) To do the dishes, (Girls!) to clean up my room

===== Beastie Boys - Paul Revere =====
Now here's a little story I got to tell
About three bad brothers you know so well
It started way back in history
With Ad-Rock, MCA, (and me) Mike D
Been had a little horsey named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
Ridin' 'cross the land, kickin' up sand
Sheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself without nobody
The sun is beatin' down on my baseball hat
The air is gettin' hot, the beer is gettin' flat
Lookin' for a girl, I ran into a guy
His name was MCA, I said, "Howdy," he said, "Hi"

He told a little story that sounded well-rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand, and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip
He said, "Can I get some?", I said, "You can't get none!"
Had a chance to run, pulled out his shotgun
Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head, and this is what he said:
"Now my name is MCA, I've got a license to kill (Yeah)
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill (Yeah)
Now what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer? (Uh-huh)
I run this land, you understand? I've made myself clear?"
We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over, but it's ready to begin

Now I got the gun, you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision, as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me
I said, "I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter"
I did it like this, I did it like that
I did it with a wiffleball bat, so
I'm on the run, the cop got my gun
And right about now it's time to have some fun
The King Ad-Rock, that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne
We rode for 6 hours, then we hit the spot
The beat was a-bumpin', and the girlies was hot
This dude was starin' like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
MCA said, "Yippie Yo, you know this kid?"
I said I didn't, but I know he did
The kid said, ("Get ready, 'cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D, and I'm about to get money"
Pulled out the jammy, I aimed it at the sky)
He yelled, ("Stick 'em up!") and let two fly
Hands went up, and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
("I'm Mike D, and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect")
MCA was with it, and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player, and I punched him in the face
Piano player's out, the music stopped
His boy had beef, and he got dropped
Mike D grabbed the money, (MCA snatched the gold)
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold

===== Beastie Boys - Sure Shot =====
I love you

'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop

I've got the brand new doo-doo, guaranteed like Yoo-hoo
I'm on like Dr. John, yeah, Mr. Zu Zu
I'm a newlywed, not a divorcee (yeah)
And everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey
Well it's the taking of the Pelham 1, 2, 3
If you want a doo-doo rhyme, then come see me
I've got the savoir faire with the unique rhymin'
I keep it on and on, it's never quitting time, and
Strictly handheld is the style I go
Never rock the mic with the pantyhose
I strap on my ear goggles, and I'm ready to go
‘Cause at the boards is the man they call the Mario
You pull up at the function, and you know I Kojak
To all the party people that are on my Bozac
I've got more action than my man, John Woo
And I've got mad hits like I was Rod Carew (yeah)

'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Because you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
You know you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Ad-Rock, come and rock the sure shot

Hurra-, Hurra-
Cane will cross fade on your ass and bust your eardrums
Listen, everybody, 'cause I'm shifting gears
I'm fresh like Dougie when I get my specs
And on the microphone, I come correct
Timing like a clock when I rock the hip-hop
Top notch is my stock on the soapbox
I've got more rhymes than I've got gray hairs
And that's a lot because I've got my share (oohh, weee)
I've got a hole in my head, and there's no one to fix it
I gotta straighten my thoughts
I'm thinking too much (yeah) sick shit
Everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes
I'll have to step back, I gotta contemplate
Well, I'm like Lee Perry, I'm very on
Rock the microphone, and then I'm gone
I'm like Vaughn Bode, I'm a Cheech Wizard
Never quittin', so won't you listen

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, yes, indeed, it's fun time

'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
MCA, come and rock the sure shot

I want to say a little something that's long overdue
The disrespect to women has got to be through
To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends
I want to offer my love and respect to the end
Well, you say I'm twenty-something, then I should be slacking
But I'm working harder than ever, and you could call it macking
So I'm supposed to sit upon my couch just watching my TV
I'm still listening to wax, I'm not using the CD
Well, I'm that kid in the corner
All fucked up, and I wanna, so I'm gonna (yeah)
Take a piece of the pie, why not, I'm not quittin'
Think I'm-a change up my style just to fit in
I keep my underwear up with a piece of elastic
I use a bullshit mic that's made out of plastic
To send my rhymes out to all the nations
Like Ma Bell, I got the ill communication

'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Keep on and rockin' the sure shot

B-boys, b-girls...
Tick-tock, tick-tick...tock-tock

===== Beastie Boys - So What'Cha Want =====
You don't stop, you keep on
And you don't stop, you can't front on that
To the S K B, you don't stop
Well, just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris
You're eating crazy cheese like you'd think I'm from Paris
You know I get fly, you think I get high
You know that I'm gone and I'm a tell you all why
So tell me who are you dissing, maybe I'm missing
The reason that you're smiling or wilding so listen
In my head I just want to take 'em down
Imagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down
Let it flow like a mud slide
When I get on I like to ride and glide
I've got depth of perception in my text y'all
I get props at my mention cause I vex y'all
So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(What'cha want?)
When you're so funny with the money that you flaunt
I said where'd you get your information from?
You think that you can front when revelation comes?
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
Well, they call me Mike D, the ever loving man
I'm like Spoonie Gee, I'm the metro politician
(Y-y-yeah)
You scream and you holler about my Chevy Impala
But the sweat is getting wetter than the ring around your collar
But like a dream I'm flowing without no stopping
Sweeter than a cherry pie with ready whip topping
Goin' from mic to mic, kickin' it wall to wall
Well, I'll be calling out you people like a casting call
Oh well, it's wacked when you're jacked in the back of a ride
With your know, with your flow when you're out gettin' by
Believe me, what you see is what you get
And you see me, comin' off as you can bet
Well, I think I'm losin' my mind this time
This time I'm losin' my mind, that's right
I said, I think I'm losin' my mind this time
This time, I'm losing my mind
(This time)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
But little do you know about something that I talk about
I'm tired of driving, it's due time that I walk about
But in the meantime, I'm wise to the demise
I've got eyes in the back of my head, so I realize
Well, I'm Dr. Spock, I'm here to rock y'all
I want you off the wall if you're playing the wall
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(What'cha want?)
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(What'cha want?)
Suckers write me checks and then they bounce
So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
See I'm the long leaner victor the cleaner
I'm the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena
Well, I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
You've got the rhyme and reason but no cause
So if you're hot to trot, you think you're slicker than grease
I've got news for you crews, you'll be suckin' like a leech
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I got the big brown boots
When you wanna get kicked like a rhyme
From the heart and the mind
There was a time when the blunt got lit
I take a hit of the weed and then blew a smoke screen
No Visine, just a little Afro-Sheen
And a High Times magazine
I like to smoke y'all but the pigs come sweating
They like the smell of the weed that I'm smoking
They can't have none of the number one sess-stash
So keep your hands off the hash, don't act rash
Cause if you move too fast, I'll pull out my gat and blast your sorry ass
And you can kiss my ass, that was the M
To the I to the K to the E to the D y'all, Ghetto Block

===== Beastie Boys - Ch-Check It Out =====
Oh, what'ch'you...what are you sayin?

All you Trekkies and TV addicts
Don't mean to diss, don't mean to bring static
All you Klingons in the fucking house
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud
Blowin' doors off hinges
I'll grab you with the pinchers
And no, I didn't retire
I'll snatch you up with a needle nose pliers

Like Mutual of Omaha
Got the ill boat you've never seen before
Glidin' in the glades
And like Lorne Greene, you know I get paid
Like caprese and with the basil
Not goofy like Darrin or Hazel
I'm a motherfuckin' Nick at Nite
With classics rerunning that you know all right

Now remain calm, no alarm
'Cause my farm ain't fat
So what's up with that?
I've got friends and family that I respect
When I think I'm too good, they put me in check
So believe when I say I'm no better than you
Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true
Like that, y'all, and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock

Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this muthafucking party out

I said, "Doc, what's the condition?
I'm a man that's on a mission"
He said, "Son, you'd better listen
Stuck in your ass is an electrician"
Like a scientist
Mmm, when I'm applying this
Method of controlling my mind
Like Einstein and the Rapping Duke combined

Now, hey, baby bubba, now what's the deal?
I didn't know you go for that mass appeal
Some call it salugi, some hot potato
I stole your mic, but you won't see it later
'Cause I work magic like a magician
I add up, the mathematician
I'm a bank cashier, engineer
I wear cotton and I don't wear sheer

Shazam and abracadabra
In the whip, I'm gonna cruise past ya
Yo, money, don't chump yourself
Put that shit back on the shelf
Light rays blazing, you're out of phase, and my crew's amazing
We're working on the record, yo, so just stay patient

Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfucking party out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out

Now, I go by the name of the King Ad-Rock
I don't wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre
Like Miss Piggy (Who, moi?)
I am the one with the clientele
You say, "Ad-Rock, you rock so well"
I've got class like pink champale
MCA, grab the mic before the mic goes stale

Don't test me, they can't arrest me
I'll fake right, cross-over and shoot lefty
You look upset, yo, calm down
You look like Cable Guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney
You never been me
You wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip-hop, B

Now-
Get your clothes right out the dryer
Put Armor All up on your tire
Sport that fresssssh attire
Tonight we goin' out, set the town on fire
Set the town ablaze
Gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head and say "those were the days"

Now check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfucking party out

===== Beastie Boys - So What'Cha Want =====
You don't stop, you keep on
And you don't stop, you can't front on that
To the S K B, you don't stop
Well, just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris
You're eating crazy cheese like you'd think I'm from Paris
You know I get fly, you think I get high
You know that I'm gone and I'm a tell you all why
So tell me who are you dissing, maybe I'm missing
The reason that you're smiling or wilding so listen
In my head I just want to take 'em down
Imagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down
Let it flow like a mud slide
When I get on I like to ride and glide
I've got depth of perception in my text y'all
I get props at my mention cause I vex y'all
So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(What'cha want?)
When you're so funny with the money that you flaunt
I said where'd you get your information from?
You think that you can front when revelation comes?
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
Well, they call me Mike D, the ever loving man
I'm like Spoonie Gee, I'm the metro politician
(Y-y-yeah)
You scream and you holler about my Chevy Impala
But the sweat is getting wetter than the ring around your collar
But like a dream I'm flowing without no stopping
Sweeter than a cherry pie with ready whip topping
Goin' from mic to mic, kickin' it wall to wall
Well, I'll be calling out you people like a casting call
Oh well, it's wacked when you're jacked in the back of a ride
With your know, with your flow when you're out gettin' by
Believe me, what you see is what you get
And you see me, comin' off as you can bet
Well, I think I'm losin' my mind this time
This time I'm losin' my mind, that's right
I said, I think I'm losin' my mind this time
This time, I'm losing my mind
(This time)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
But little do you know about something that I talk about
I'm tired of driving, it's due time that I walk about
But in the meantime, I'm wise to the demise
I've got eyes in the back of my head, so I realize
Well, I'm Dr. Spock, I'm here to rock y'all
I want you off the wall if you're playing the wall
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(What'cha want?)
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(What'cha want?)
Suckers write me checks and then they bounce
So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
See I'm the long leaner victor the cleaner
I'm the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena
Well, I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
You've got the rhyme and reason but no cause
So if you're hot to trot, you think you're slicker than grease
I've got news for you crews, you'll be suckin' like a leech
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
(So what'cha want?)
I got the big brown boots
When you wanna get kicked like a rhyme
From the heart and the mind
There was a time when the blunt got lit
I take a hit of the weed and then blew a smoke screen
No Visine, just a little Afro-Sheen
And a High Times magazine
I like to smoke y'all but the pigs come sweating
They like the smell of the weed that I'm smoking
They can't have none of the number one sess-stash
So keep your hands off the hash, don't act rash
Cause if you move too fast, I'll pull out my gat and blast your sorry ass
And you can kiss my ass, that was the M
To the I to the K to the E to the D y'all, Ghetto Block

===== Beastie Boys - Make Some Noise =====
Yeah, get up
Yeah
Uh

Yes, here we go again, give you more, nothing lesser
Back on the mic, it's the anti-depressor
Ad-Rock--no pressure--yes, we need this
The best is yet to come and, yes, believe this
Leggo my Eggo while I flex my ego
Sip on Prosecco, dressed up tuxedo
Sipping coffee, playing Keno in the casino
Want a lucky number, ask Mike Dino
I burn the competition like a flamethrower
My rhymes, they age like wine as I get older
I'm getting bolder, competition is wanin'
I got the ball and I see the lane and

We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me
Crazy, crazy, crazy

Armed insurrection, popular election
Get paid every year like tax collection
Hear my perfection, rotary connection
Taking MCs down by lethal rap injection
I'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed
You must have drank a Fizzy-Lifting Drink and you got lifted
And sifted, I'm just riffing
And when I catch MCs, it's time for wing clipping
I fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle
A seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle
My ego is off and running and gone
Cause I'm about the best and if you fess, well, that's wrong

We got a--
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me
Crazy, crazy, crazy
The break is crazy
Crazy-crazy

Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision
I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching
Put it in formaldehyde and put it on the shelf
And you can show it to your friends and say, "That's my old self"
Can't do me nothing, can't tell me nada
Don't bug me now because I'm doing the lambada (bada!)
The forbidden dance (wha!), here's my chance
To make romance in my B-boy stance
Parlay romancing into financing
Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson
The roaches check in, but they never check out
I set the record straight, no doubt

We got a--
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight
Make some noise if you're with me
You gotta make some noise if you're with me
(A party on the left, a party on the right)
Make some noise if you're with me
(We gotta party for the motherfucking right to fight)
Make some noise if you're with me

===== Beastie Boys - Shake Your Rump =====
Now, I rock a house party at the drop of a hat (Yeah)
Now, I beat a biter down with an aluminum bat
A lot of people they be Jonesin' just to hear me rock the mic
They be staring at the radio, staying up all night
So like a pimp, I'm pimpin', I got a boat to eat shrimp in
Nothing wrong with my leg, I'm just B-boy limpin'
Got arrested at the Mardi Gras for jumping on a float
My man MCA's got a beard like a billy goat
"Ooh-ooh" is my disco call
MCA (Ha-ha), I'm gettin' rope, y'all
Routines I bust, and the rhymes that I write
And I'll be busting routines and rhymes all night
Like eating burgers or chicken and you'll be picking ya nose, man
I'm on time, homie, that's how it goes
You heard my style, I think you missed the point
It's the joint!

Mike D (Yeah?) With your bad self running things
(What's up?) With your bad breath onion rings
Well, I'm Mike D, and I'm back from the dead
Chillin' at the beach, down at Club Med
Make another record 'cause the people, they want more of this
Suckers, they be saying they can take out Adam Horovitz
Hurricane, you got clout
Other DJ's, he'll put your head out
A puppet on a string, I'm paid to sing or rhyme
Or do my thing, I'm in a lava lamp, inside my brain hotel
I might be freakin or peakin', but I rock well
The Patty Duke Show, the Wrench, and then I bust the Tango
Got more rhymes than Jamaica got mango
I got the peg leg at the end of my stump-a

Shake your rump-a

A full clout, y'all, a full clout, y'all
And when the mic is in my mouth, I turn it out, y'all
A full clout
*sound of a bong hit followed by a shotgun noise*
Never been dumped, 'cause I'm the most mackinest
Never been jumped, 'cause I'm known the most packinest
Yeah, we've got beef, chief, we're knocking out teeth, chief
And if you don't believe us, you should question your belief, Keith
Like Sam the butcher bringing Alice the meat
Like Fred Flintstone, driving around with bald feet
Should I have another sip? Nah, skip it
In the back of the ride and bust with the whippet
Rope-a-dope dookies all around the neck
Running from the law, the press, and the parents
 No, mine's Clarence
From downtown, Manhattan, the Village
My style is wild, and you know that it still is
Disco bag schlepping, and you're doing the bump
Shake your rump-a

===== Beastie Boys - Flute Loop =====
I ain't goin' no place
Move? Me?!
Give it up, and you don't quit
Like that, y'all, pop some more shit

So, so, so, just sit back and max and relax
Off the tracks that I kick, come on and live it up
'Cause I get funky like diaper rash (Nah)
And you know I'm mad spunky, and I'm making cash
Well, I got sex rhymes like Victoria got secrets
To all you porno peepers who are trying to peep this
I'm like Al Goldstein, I'm all about screwing
Lead my team to sixty wins like my man Pat Ewing
Like getting shot out the barrel of a wave
Like virgin pow on the peaks of AK
Like a sound that goes to the depths of the soul
Well, that's the feeling that I make my goal

Music to rock the nation
Music to rock the nation
Uh, uh, check it out
Uh, and leave it out

A little wine with my dinner so I'm the Grape Ape
I feel like a winner when I make a mixtape
'Cause I get ill when I'm on the pause button
And I get my fill, and now you can't say nothing
More soul on this train than Don Cornelius
Got the mad sub-woofer pumping bass for your anus
Just getting on the mic at the monthly function
The wires hitting switches connected at the junction
Perlman's got beats, and it ain't no secret
Dante found his shit, but you know he freaked it
And so the story goes on and on
Down in SD50 till the early morning

Music to rock the nation
Music to rock the nation

===== Beastie Boys - Get It Together =====
Heh heh heh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh-ah
Uh eh eh uh (Woo!)

One-two, one-two, keep it on
Listen to the shit because we keep it till dawn
Listen to the Abstract, got it going on
Listen to the ladies, come on and let me spawn
On your eggs, then you go up the river
Listen to the Abstract, that freaky nigga

Now I'm Ad Rock, and I shock, and I tick, and I tock
And I can't stop with the body rock

See, I've got heart like John Starks
Hitting mad sparks
Pass me the mic, and I'll be rockin' the whole park

Well, I'm the M to the C to the A, and it's a must
The rhymes that we bust on the topic of lust

And my Moms is not butt, but fuck it
Let me get down to the rhythm
Yes, I get funky, and I'm shooting all my jism
Like John Holmes, the X-rated nigga
Listen to the shit 'cause I am the ill figure
Nobody's getting any bigger than this

Get it together
Get-get it together
Get...
Phone is ringing, oh my God
Get it together, see what's happening


Ad Rock's down with the Ione
Listen to the shit 'cause both of them is bony
Gotta do it like this, like Chachi and Joanie

'Cause she's the cheese, and I'm the macaroni
So why all the fight, why all the fuss?
'Cause ha, I ain't got no dust
Yeah, you know I'm getting silly
Got a Grandma Hazel and a Grandma Tilly

Well, I'm the Grand Royal prez, and I'm also a member
Born on the cusp in the month of November
I do the Patty Duke, in case you don't remember
Well, I freak a funky beat like the shit was in a blender

Well, I'm long gone, word is bond
Don't need a motherfuckin' fool tellin' me right from wrong
I don't think I'm slick, nor do I play like I'm hard
But I'ma drive the lane like I was Evan Bernard

And I be working on my game

Because life is taxing

Gotta get it together

And see what's happening

Get it together
Wait a minute, wait a minute (Get)
Wait a minute, (Get it) wait a minute
Get it together
Wait a minute, (Get) wait a minute (Get-get)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Get it together
Wait a minute, wait a minute
S-see what's happening


I go One-Two like my name was Biz Mark
But I had to do the shit, just let me embark
On the lyric and the noun and the verb
Let me kick the shit off 'cause, yo, I'm not the herb

Well, it's not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare
The Moog with the funk for your derriere
While we're on that topic, yes, I like to mention
When it comes to bonin' - woo! - I'm representing

Spacin', zonin', talkin' on the phone and
My brain is roamin', and I don't know where it's goin'
Talking lots of shit, a little tweaking on the weekend (what?)
I gotta to get him by the reins because I know that I'm freaking (yeah)

Well, I'm a funky soul and I'm a Scorpio
And when I get my flow I'm Dr. On-the-Go
So, Q-Tip, what you on the mic for?

Because I had to talk about the times when I rhyme
And when the MC's come in my face, I'm like mace
Because I back them off with the quills
'Cause I have to tell you, nigga, 'cause I'll keep you under prills
Resting on Nine-One-One Sixteenth Ave., off the Farmers Boulevard (yeah)
Well I'm from Manhattan, MCA's from Brooklyn
Yeah, MCA, your shit be cookin'

(Yeah)
Praying mantis on the court, and I can't be beat
But, yo, Tip, what's up with the boots on your feet?

Got the Timbos on the toes, and this is how it goes
Oh, one-two, oh my god

One-two, oh my god, I got some shit
I've got the kung fu grip behind my green trap kit
Never, ever, ever smoking crack

Never, ever, ever fucking wack
I eat the fuckin' pineapple Now & Laters
Listen to me now, don't listen to me later
Fuck it, 'cause I know I didn't make it fuckin' rhyme for real
But, yo, technically I'm as hard as steel

Gonna get it together, watch it
Gonna get it together, Ma Bell
I'm like Ma Bell, I got the ill communication
Ma Bell, got the ill communication
Ma Bell, got the ill communications (Who's that?)
Ma Bell, got the ill communication (Word to ma word to ma)
Ma Bell
Eh-eh
Ah-ah-ha-ha
Keep it on and on

===== Beastie Boys - Hey Ladies =====
Heyyy, ladies in the place, I'm callin' out to ya!
There never was a city kid truer and bluer
(There's more to me than you'll ever know)
And I got more hits than Sadaharu Oh
(Tom Thumb), Tom Cushman, or Tom Foolery
Date women on TV with the help of Chuck Woolery
(Words flowin' out just like the Grand Canyon)
And I'm always out lookin' for a female companion
I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib

Wheelin' and dealin', I make a likkle bit of a stealin'
I'll bring you (back) to the (place), and your (dress) I'm peelin'
Your body's on time and your mind is appealin'
Starin' at the cracks up there up on the ceilin'

I'm talking to the girl, telling her I'm all-knowing
Well, she's talking to the kid ("Who?" To the kid, to the kid!)
I'm telling her every lie that you know that I never did

"Hey ladies!" ("Get funky!")
"All the ladies in the house!"
"The ladies, the ladies"
]
Well – me (in a corner) with a good-lookin' daughter
I dropped my drawers, (said) 
(We was cuttin' up the rug) She started cuttin' up the carpet
(In my apartment) I begged her "Please stop it!"
Well – the gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothin' but a crab!
(Educated?) No! (Stupid?) Yep
And when I say stupid, I mean stupid 
I'm not 'James At 15', or Chachi 'In Charge'
I'm Adam and I'm adamant (about livin' large!)
With the white Sassoons and then the looks that kill
(Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville)
I met a little cutie, she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie, but I kicked her in the booty
'Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
(You be listenin' to my records – a number one sound)
Just step to the rhythm, step, (step!) to the ride!
I've got an open mind, so why don't you all get inside?!
(Tune in,) turn on, to my tune that's live!
Ladies flock, like bees to a hive

"Hey ladies!" ("Get funky!")
"Ain't it funky now?"
"Ain't" "It" "Funky" "Now?"
"Hey" "Hey" "Hey" "Hey la--" "Hey, ladies!"
"Ain't it funky now?"
]
Well, you–know–that––
She's got a gold tooth, you know she's hardcore
She'll show you a good time, then she'll show you the door
(Break up with your girl!) It ended in tears!
Vincent Van Gogh, go and mail that ear!
I call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin'
The phone booth on the corner is (damp) and it's stinkin'!
(She said "Come on over," it was me that she missed)
I threw that trash can through her window 'cause–'cause you know I got dissed!
Your old lady left you, and you went insane!
You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 Train
Well, take my advice, at any price
A gorilla like your mother is mighty weak, man
(Suckin' down pints until I didn't know)
Woke up in the morning with a Won Ton Ho
('Cause I announce) I like girls that bounce!
With the weight that pays (about a pound per ounce)
Girls with curls, and big (long locks)
And beatnik chicks, just wearing their smocks
Walkin' high and mighty, like she's number one

"Hey ladies!" ("Get funky!")
"What's that?"
 "Good god!"
"Dance!"
 "Good god!"
 Baby, baby, baby, baby
 "Ain't it funky, brother? Hahaha"
"Hey" "Hey" "Hey" "Hey la--" "Hey, ladies!"

"Ready? One... You will do this four times with the left
Four with the right, then eight times with both
Then repeat" Ah... Clap your hands...

Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'

Now, let me get some action from the back section
We need body rockin' not perfection
Let your backbone flip but don't slip a disc
And let your spine unwind — just take a risk
I wanna' do the freak until the break of dawn
Tell me party people, is that so wrong?
The ship is docking, interlockin'
And up-rockin', electro-shocking
We're getting down, computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
Now all of y'all, get off the wall
Have a ball and get involved with

Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'

Flame on, I'm gone
I'm so sweet like a nice bonbon
Came out rapping when I was born
Mom said rock it 'til the break of dawn
Puttin' bodies in motion 'cause I got the notion
Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion
The sound of the music makin' you insane
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame
Like a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap
We need body-rockin', not perfection
Let me get some action from the back section

Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'

Mike D, with the master plan
I said, Ooh my-my and thank you, ma'am
And when I grab the mic, you scream, "Ooh, goddamn"
The crème de la crème is who I am
MCA, where have you been?
Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim
And Adrock, light up the place
And if you pull my card, you pull the ace
And if you ask me, turn up the bass
And if you play defender
I could be your hyperspace... So

A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing
Body movin', body movin'
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin'

===== Beastie Boys - Root Down =====
That's a record
Uhhhh...
Huh...
Yeah

I kick it root down, I put my root down
I kick it root down, I put my root down
So how we gonna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
Yeah, how you wanna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
So how you gonna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
Gonna break it on down, gonna kick it root down

It's not a put down, I put my foot down
And then I make some love, I put my root down
I’m like "Sweetie Pie" by the Stone Alliance
Everybody know I'm known for dropping science
‘Cause I'm electric like Dick Hyman
I guess you'd expect to catch the crew rhymin'
Never let you down with the stereo sound
So, Mike, get on the mic and turn it out (Mike D)

We're talking root down, I put my boot down (Boot down)
And if you want to battle me, you're putting loot down (Loot down)
I said it’s root down, it's time to scoot down (Scoot down)
I'm-a step up to the mic in my goose down (Goose down)
Come up representing from the upper west
Moneymakin' putting me to the test
Sometimes I feel as though I've been blessed
Because I'm doing what I want, so I never rest (yeah, Mike it, Mike it)

Well, I'm not coming out goofy like the Fruit of the Loom guys
Just strutting like The Meters with the “Look-ka Py Py"
'Cause downtown Brooklyn is where I was born
But when the snow is fallin’, then I am gone (oh weee)
You might think that I'm a fanatic
A phone call from Utah, and I'm throwing a panic
So break it to the root when we kick it on down
Jimmy Smith is my man, I want to give him a pound

I kick it root down, I put my root down
I kick it root down, I put my root down
So how you wanna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
'Cause how we gonna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
So how we gonna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
Gonna break it on down, gonna kick it root down (Yeah)

Well, Ad-Rock (Huh), don't stop, come on
Just get on the mic with the tic and the toc, yeah
I'll fill you to the fuckin' rim like Brim
I'm walking down your block, and you say, "That's him
There goes the guy with the funky sound"
The Beatsie Boys, you know we come to get down
Because I've got the flow where I grab my dick
And say, “Oh my god, that's the funky shit!"
So I’ma pass the mic and cause a panic (yeah)
The original nasal kid is doing damage

Every morning I took the train to High Street Station
Doing homework on the train, what a fucked up situation
On the way back up, hearing battle tapes
Through the underground, underneath the sky scrapes
It's like Harlem World Battles on the Zulu Beat Show
It's Kool Moe Dee vs. Busy Bee, there's one you should know, (yeah)
Enough of that, I just want to give some respect due
MCA, grab the mic and Ma Bell will connect you

Bob Marley was a prophet for the freedom fight
"If dancin' prays to the lord, then I will feel all right"
I'm feelin' good to play a little music (music)
Tears running down my face 'cause I love to do it (love to do it)
And no one can stop this flow from flowing on
A flow master of disaster with a sound that's gone (yeah)
I'll give a little shout out to my dad and mom (yeah)
For bringing me into this world and so on

I kick it root down, I put my root down
I kick it root down, I put my root down
Yeah, so how we gonna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
Yeah, how you wanna kick it? Gonna kick it root down
So how we gonna rock it? Gonna rock it root down
Break it on down, gonna kick it root down
Yeah, that shit's on down

And that's a record, that's a record 'cause of Mario
And that's a record, that's a record 'cause of Mario
And that's a record, that's a record to Mario
Aww, now that's a record, buddy

===== Beastie Boys - Rhymin & Stealin =====
Because mutiny on the Bounty's what we're all about
I'm gonna board your ship and turn it on out
No soft sucker with a parrot on his shoulder
'Cause I'm bad gettin' bolder, cold getting colder
Terrorizin' suckers on the seven seas
And if you got beef, you'll get capped in the knees
We got sixteen men on a dead man's chest
And I shot those suckers, and I'll shoot the rest

Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling
'Cause I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

Shhh… Snatching gold chains, nickin' pieces of eight
I got your money and your honey and the fly name plate
We got wenches on the benches and bitties with titties
Housin' all girlies from city to city
One for all and all for one
Takin' out emcees with a big shotgun
All for one and one for all
Because the Beastie Boys have gone AWOL
Friggin' in the riggin' and cuttin' your throat
Big bitin' suckers gettin' thrown in the moat
We got maidens and wenches, man, they're on the ace
Ah, Captain Bligh is gonna die when we break his face

Most illingest b-boy, well, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves
Ali Baba and the forty thieves

Torchin' and crackin' and rhymin' and stealin'
Robbin' and rapin', bustin' two in the ceiling
I'm wheelin', I'm dealin', I'm drinkin', not thinkin'
Never cower, never shower, and I'm always stinkin'
Yo-ho-ho and a pint of Brass Monkey
And when my girlie shakes her hips, she sure gets funky
Skirt-chasin', free-basin', killin' every village
We drink and rob and rhyme and pillage

Most illingest b-boy, well, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

I was…
I've been drinking my rum, a def son of a gun
(I fought the law) And I cold won
Blackbeard's weak, Moby Dick's on the chicks
'Cause I pull out the jammy, and I squeeze off six
My pistol is loaded, I shot Betty Crocker
Deliver Colonel Sanders down to Davey Jones' locker
Rhymin' and stealin' in a drunken state
And I'll be rockin' my rhymes all the way to Hell's gate

Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling
And I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling
'Cause I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most illingest b-boy, I got that feeling
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'

Most chillinest b-boy
I am most ill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most killingest b-boy
I am most chill, and I'm rhymin' and stealin'
Most dustin'-out b-boy, I tossin' my dust
Most finkiest b-boy, I'm doin' that finkin'
Most rhyminest b-boy, I'm stretchin' my shade
Most shootinest b-boy, I think you're shit
Most rhyminest b-boy, I'll steal your shit, homeboy
Most taxinest b-boy, I tax you, boy
Most illingest, illingest, illingest b-boy
Waxin' all y'all squares
Yeah!

Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju— okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker, get to bustin'

===== A$AP Rocky - 1Train =====
Uh, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar—
Dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
We outlawed, then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "Doo, doo," I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm, mmm!"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9s on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P., I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed to
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed to, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait! No, I don't give a
Flying duck nothin' but a buckshot; ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood-clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf

Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this
Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon's reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham

Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, "How you ask for that?"
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass (on your wifey's ass)
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist

===== A$AP Rocky - Praise the Lord (Da Shine) =====
Get it
Text a message, I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady takin' shots, but never hurtin' numbers
Even then, y'all don't worry nothin'
And I'd like to give a shout out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout outs all my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
Time to go, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowin', chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumpin' out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smokin' when it's time to focus
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer

I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

Yeah, I sold the pack, the loose, the hard (Yeah)
I listened to X, I peeped the bars (Yeah)
The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs
The game's a trap, protect your heart (Yeah)
I waited in line, return, refine
The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze
These niggas disease, don't speak, we squeeze
I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss

I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

Uh, uh, she came, I came, now what's my name?
My chain, my pants, my pants with the chain
They know it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage (What?)
My Vans, my braids (What?), my mans, my babes (What?)
My girls, my ex (What?), my hoes that I left (What?)
The way I stepped out the car (What?), that's a flex (What?)
Give thanks, get fresh (What?), praise the Lord then finesse (What?), bless

I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

===== A$AP Rocky - Goldie =====
Aha, aha

Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

Let's take it to the basics, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'ma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad 'cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up to money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, "Tell it to my face"
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

Oh, yeah, oh, right
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, yeah
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off (Right, right)

I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell my niggas quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported, just important as your President
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowing blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't 'round my clique for nothing
'Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing

This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos (Pesos)

Yo, yo, yo, your bitch just said I'm hot, man, I told her I agree
She gon' really think I'm hot if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's
Popping E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G
A.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breathe
Inhale, exhale, cocaine, X pills
Import, export, Harlem catching rec still
So mami, show me how that neck feel (Feel)
Later show me how the rest feel, for now just chill

This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll

===== A$AP Rocky - Everyday =====
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

Uh, off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits (Yeah)
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord, forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit (Uh-huh), I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, "Holler if ya need some dick"
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine (Yeah)
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow (Uh)

Sipping on that syrup, till I'm messed up, like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers, you prolly own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, I'm pimpin' hoes, you could tell by my paystubs
My niggas gettin' right, smokin' weed with dirty Sprite
I'm going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

Finna wild out for the weekend, me, myself, and I – my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, A$AP niggas finna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy

Six shots got me feelin' like 'Pac, boy, party all night, shit don't stop, boy

I'm going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

And your girl just said they with us

Won't you pour it up and stop the babysitting
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids-es

Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feelin' for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

I've been gettin' fly 'cause the gimmick's so dope
I've been gettin' high 'cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinkin', drivin', now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt 'cause the weather's so cold, oh
Feelin' low sometime when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feelin' low sometime when the light shines down
Makes me high

Now I gotta let 'em know who's really trill

Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye

I ain't never lookin' for no handouts
Broke ass niggas never helpin' with they hands out
Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin' fuck the world, never catch me with my pants down
Always been a stand-up guy, I'd rather stand out
Raf Simons, Stan Smith edition with my bands out
I'm the trillest one to do it since Pimp, nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me, that's a man down
Trick, what? Pimps up, hoes down, woah now
Slow down, see they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature, uh
Trappin' through the speaker, peep the beeper ringer, uh
Turnin' off phones, just to reach 'em, gotta beep 'em
I'm a Lord motherfucker, better greet him if you see him

Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill (Uh)
Nah, I ain't really into throwin' shots
But these motherfuckers better give me my props, word to Pac
Who the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed?
Reason why you niggas wearin' gold?
Jail pose in the pictures, prayin' fingers to your nose

Prosper still and strive, to the sky, call it catastrophic
We don't ever die, we just multiply, bitch

Fake-ass niggas, you know what I'm sayin'?
These niggas be out here talkin' 'bout they a street nigga and shit, man
Niggas be gettin' extorted like a motherfucker out here, man, you know what I'm sayin'?

===== A$AP Rocky - Phoenix =====
Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Fuck Illuminati lies, say I'm lucified
Baptized in the gutter, motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores, they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars, nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I? Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures, call me Basquiat, Picasso
Capo Head Hancho, now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer, Pacquiao, but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke, I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle, goodnight folks

Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied, still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch, but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed, sheets, no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas, wassup with niggas?
So my new attitude is like "Fuck them niggas!"
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas, ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile, you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm, take cover niggas

If I shall ever fall, Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby, two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups
Now I'm walking on my own, y'all, wish me luck

Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan

Racin' laps, re-up went to waste, it pays to make it stack
Face the fact, there's always niggas out there, tryin' to knock the (Hustle)

So who am I to call it black? Black man, black male
Black ball, black opsy, black diamonds glistenin' (Yeah)
Attract the pigs and all the rats, kitten scratch
I went from roaches on my bump to red brooches on the cuff
Of my tux, chauffeur pullin' up, no if, and's​ or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks, 100 thousand spent on Goyard
Used 'em once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street, vintage gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housin'
Wildin' 'til they throw me in them cuffs
Mouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartiers (Uh)
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Changed the game and made them say (Uh)
Ain't no limits to this shit, life's a flick, you're stickin' to the script

Flexin' muscle, hit the block, I bet I teach you niggas how to (Hustle)
Sellin' coca on the charts, watch it double
Uh, takin' meetings on my bus, this shit my mobile office
Gettin' head while at my desk, this shit my oval office
I remember when I got a hundred for recordings
Now the sum of my performances just put me on the Forbes list
Fuck jiggy, I'm flawless, fuck pretty, I'm gorgeous
Your favorite rappers' corpses couldn't measure my importance
My mind is out in orbits, plus my ego got endorsements
Heard the people want that raw shit, but y'all be talkin' bullshit

Get the news flash, that the truth back

===== A$AP Rocky - Jukebox Joints =====
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothin' at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but who will lean if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know (Yeah)

She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean, I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashin', left her sleepin' on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like, "Flacko, where your ass been?
Heard you done with fashion, now your ass is acting"
I'm trippin' off the acid, now your ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in vintage Tommy and some mid Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music make me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture, changed hip-hop on you
Smoking like a rasta was my pop's culture
I be damned if I die sober, I'll be sure to visit 'Pac for you

And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothin' at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know (Uh, uh)

And shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight
Let me see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Bimmers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
'Cause I be playin' with these womens like they sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, 'cause it's droppin' next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, "I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden"
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
Uh, that touch-your-soul music, I get you higher
Grab your lighter fluid, might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the Father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid
Even Montell can't tell you how we do it
Sit back and watch me do it

And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothin' at all
So tell me now, does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

Okay, let's get past all the swag trappin' and fashion talkin'
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rappin' talkin'
They rap impulsive, get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughin' off it
I changed rap, pushed fashion forward, yeah, I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both actin' awkward?
Jigglin' baby, nah, go 'head, bitch
Ain't nothin' better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ayy, just play it like I didn't tell you
Niggas takin' pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away just one day like some love birds
Only one word that I'm afraid of is the "Love" word

More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lonely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
What's up, bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who need friends?
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Oh, man, remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man, everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ayy, bitch, you missed out, #fomo
I got one child, one child
But I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more
They wanna throw me under a white jail
'Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male
Hallelujah

Ridin' 'round with that mask on

Like a Shaq attack on that backboard, clap on, clap off
Blue pit in my back yard, red nose my bad broad
Titan full of that hydro, pretty nigga, no catwalk
Big burner in your big mouth, pussy niggas suck lead off
I pull it up then skirt off, vodka shots, he smeared off

Beef is on my entrée (Yeah), gin and juice, that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way (Uh)
Pussy on a Sunday (Yeah), business on a Monday (Yeah)

Bitches lickin' and lockin' up my Swishers
Once she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal
Spread the news, I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel (Uh)
Before I get aggressive, forget it, war-ready
Already tested, tears and blood invested
'Til my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that (Uh)
Black magic on the tires, only I
Roll— Rollin' down a lonely mile, phony smile
Warrants, police on me now, still tourin'
And my chain, it may slow me down, cheer for it
Pain in its purest form
Don't complain, I came to reign from here forward
Still 'noid, so the crib got clear doors
Burnin' planes in my Air Force
And all I can see is Clearports (Uh)

Sing
Louder
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer

Since Rocky spit like André
I'm gon' kill 'em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entrée
Eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy
Mm, enjoy, when I get annoyed
Know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid
Body get found by a little fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenigga, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a 'roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
Fuck talking, how fast you could grip a nine?
Damn
Look at how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit to crime
These niggas had the sidewalk sippin' wine
Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq' so I soak in, lift and shine
Tip-tip and toe, I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil' for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many times your eyes seen a nigga die?
Never
Spittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better, nigga

Listening for the telephone
But when I get your call, I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is like a dream come true
A real life fantasy

No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that

You must've put a thing on me
Because there aren't no words that can explain
I'm livin' in ecstasy
And you can best believe, I got your back
You never have to feel no pain
'Cause I'll dedicate my life to you
You'll never look for love again

No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
We'll always be together, any kind of weather

Only tenderonis can give a special love
A special kind of love that makes you feel good inside

Give it a chance, girl

And if you find a tenderoni that is right for you

===== Bobby Brown - Don't Be Cruel =====
Girl, the only thing that matters in my life
Is that I'm down for you and treat you right
You've got no cause to treat me cold as ice

Oh, oh, oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my love to you
You should be giving me your love too, oh
But you just keep on acting just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Don't be cruel, 'cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no
Don't be cruel
Girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh, uh don't be cruel

Hey, yo, cutie what's up with this attitude?
I thought I was being real good to you
I treat you sweet, take you out at night
But you never say thanks, girl, that ain't right
I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high-post but you play me close
And if I put a drink up, you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from nine to five
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied

Oh, oh, oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my heart to you
You should be giving me your heart too, oh
But you just keep on acting just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Don't be cruel, 'cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no
Don't be cruel
Girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh, uh, don't be cruel

From fancy cars to diamond rings
I've just about given you everything
There's really not much I won't do for you
I bought you twelve yellow roses and candy too
I like to be up front and never play the back
But the way you treat me girl is like a heart attack
I'm a real troop trooper aiming for the top
And with you by my side, d-dollars I will clock

Oh, oh, oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my love to you
You should be giving me your love too, oh
But you just keep on acting just like a fool
You know it ain't cool
It just ain't cool (Hoo)
Don't be cruel
I know, oh

We used to hang out tough, just kickin' around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart, I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find
Although I want you bad I could let you go
'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
Lo to the fact that I want you, Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see
But you had to start illin', tryna make a killin'
Thought about the dollars I make and you were willing
To be with me, Bobby B
But with a bad attitude I can't compete
Now you know my name, now I know your game
You want to be with me you got to be the same way
That another girl would be, and if you wanna be with me

Don't be cruel (Don't be, don't be), 'cause I would never be that cruel to you
(Don't be, don't be, baby)
Uh no, oh oh, no
Don't be cruel (Don't be, don't be)
Girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh, uh, don't be cruel
Don't be cruel (Don't be, don't be), 'cause I would never be that cruel to you
(Don't be, don't be, baby)
Uh no, oh oh, no
Don't be cruel (Don't be, don't be)
Girl, you need to change your attitude (No, oh)
Uh no, oh

You want somethin' done
You gotta do it yourself
OW!  Uhh..
Yeah I think this is gonna be another one of those funky ones
Heart & Soul, d-d-dance!

If I was you, and you were me, you'd want to be winning
If you want something bad ya, you gotta wanna give your all
'Cause I believe so much in we and know we're not kidding
If you feel the same as me, yo, you gotta want to take the ball

Now I find out that nothing is given
Don't know where the cards may fall
All I know is that we've gotta get it
We've gotta make it on our own

Well, I guess we're gonna have to take control (all on our own)
If it's up to us, we've got to take it home (all on our own)

Now can't you see that all we need to be a go-getter
Gotta make your own decisions, you gotta go for what you know
There comes a time in our lives, you wanna be bigger
Gotta keep, keep on pushing, you gotta learn to take control, yeah

Now I find out that nothing is given
Don't know where the cards may fall

Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
They're called the Ghostbusters and they're in control
Had 'em throwin' a party for a bunch of children
While all the while the slime was under the building
So they packed up their group, got a grip, came equipped
Grabbed their proton packs off their back and they split
Found about Vigo, the master of evil
Try to battle my boys? That's not legal
(Oh-we-oh) They're in control
(Oh-we-oh) Y-Y-Ya know it
(All on our own)
I said they're in control

Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

When you trust someone
And you know you're on their back
You ain't got no trustin' about you
And you claim that you
Don't care what where I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you

Say you trust someone
Why are you calling all around
Think I've got some dip on the side
Girl, you don't trust no one
And you're constantly in doubt
You lose the game if you play that way

Get up off my back (Get off)
Save your heart attack (Yeah, baby)
Ain't nobody humpin' around (Ain't nobody humpin' around)
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin' around

When you love someone
And you wanna love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
And you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you

Say that you love someone
Why you calling all my friends
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl, you don't love no one
You don't know what love's about
You lose the game if you, if you play that way, yeah

Get up off my back

Girl, when you trust someone
You don't call on everybody
Ain't nobody foolin' around

You lose all your clout and
You lose the game, baby, if you play that way, yeah
Back to the B-B-Brown

Back to the B-B-Brown

My name is Brown, that's what I'm called, so
Don't try to step to be wrong or you'll fall slow
'Cause I just wanna kick soul to ya
Maybe, baby, take control of ya just like I told ya
I wanna roll
On the tip that's smooth and
Gonna make ya move and groove and
Leaves ya like "ooh" when I touch ya
Give ya so much of
The feeling of the deck that I'm dealin'
When I rub ya up and down
Yo Stylz, kick it

Well, I know it's been a while
Since you heard a change in a style
So what I'm gonna do is kick in something fly and new
A change, this one from the typical
A bit more than regular, I'm not like the others, original
'Cause originality and creativity
Added up together equals the BBB Posse
Yeah, we in the house, yo, kick it

Get up off my back (Come on)
Save your heart attack (Come on)
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(Throw your hands in the air, come on, come on)
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
(I can make you bounce)
Ain't nobody humpin' around

Girl, you said you love me
And you said you trust me
Why you think I'm foolin' around?
I can't stand the pressure
You know I'm yours forever
Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody humpin' around, baby

Get up off my back (Uh)
Save your heart attack (Ow)
Ain't nobody humpin' around

Yeah
This is like the old times
I know a lot of you all out there can relate to the old times
So this one's for you
Yeah
Listen

If I take you back in the room, spent you around, my Baby
Take off your clothes and all of mine, too, laid you down
Way down

We could be discrete nobody have to know, ha
We don't need no sheets, we can just close the door, my baby
I can take you places you ain't been before
Soon as we get there, baby
You'll be coming back for more

'Cause If ain't good enough, good enough, baby
I'll work harder
I'll keep pumpin' every minute, girl
And baby I'll do you up, do you up, baby
And I will not stop 'til I know you're hot

If I touch your body tonight, will you touch mine?
Will you touch me baby? Right here
Kiss both your lips and rubbin' those thighs
Taste your wine
Let me taste you baby, ah

I can do it soft or I can do it hard
I can make you scream if you let down your guard, my baby
It's not too far from here to ecstasy
I know you want good lovin'
So lay your body next to me

If ain't good enough, good enough, baby (If it ain't good)
I'll work harder
Pumpin' every minute, girl
And baby I'll do you up, do you up, baby
And I will not stop 'til I know you're hot
If ain't good enough, good enough, baby (If it ain't good)
I'll work harder (I'll work hard)
Pumpin' every minute, girl (I'll work hard)
And baby I'll do you up, do you up, baby
And I will not stop 'til I know you're hot (Know you're hot)

Slow moving in your body
Feels like I'm gonna be in here all night
And when the love gets rolling
Start coming without stop
Filled to the brim
I'm gonna drip down to the very last drop

And if ain't good enough for you, baby, ha
I'll do it all for you
And I will not stop 'til I know you're hot
If ain't good enough, good enough, baby (If it ain't good)
I'll work harder (I'll work hard)
Pumpin' every minute, girl (I'll work hard)
And baby I'll do you up, do you up baby
And I will not stop 'til I know you're hot (Know you're hot)

If ain't good enough then I'll work harder
Turn it up, I'll please you, darlin'
Do it up, do it up just for you
And baby I'll taste the wine and give you pleasure
Close the door, I'll do whatever (Baby, I'll do whatever)
'Til I know you're hot

If ain't good enough, good enough baby (If it ain't good)
I'll work harder (I'll work harder)
Pumpin' every minute, girl
And baby I'll do you up, do you up baby
And I will not stop 'til I know you're hot
If ain't good enough, good enough, baby (Yeah)

Pumpin' every minute, girl
And baby, I'll do you up, do you up baby

===== Bobby Brown - Every Little Step =====
Good lovin'
Ow, yeah

I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn
Listening for the telephone
But when I get your call, I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is like a dream come true
A real life fantasy

No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that

Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together

I can't think too straight, I'm all confused
You must've put a thing on me
Because there aren't no words that can explain
I'm livin' in ecstasy
And you can best believe, I got your back
You never have to feel no pain
'Cause I'll dedicate my life to you
You'll never look for love again

No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
We'll always be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that

Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together

Every little (Woo)
Every little step I (Every little step)
Every little, every little step I take (Oh no)
Every little
Every little step I (Every little step)
Every little, we'll be together, girl
Good lovin'
Good lovin'

No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that, girl

Every little step I take, you will be there (You'll, you'll be there)
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there (You, you'll be there)
Every little step I make, we'll be together

Every little step I take (Oh no), you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together (You, you'll be there)
Every little step I take (Every step), you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together (We will be together)

Every little
Every little step I (Every little step)
Every little, every little step I take (Oh no)
Every little
Every little step I (Every little step)
Every little, we'll be together, girl
Every little step I take (Good lovin'), you will be there

===== Bobby Brown - Get Away =====
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away
Ain't nothin' but the funk, baby!

I need a peace of mind, I'm stressed out today
It's about that time to make that get away
Dealing with the people I deal with everyday
Got to find a place I can hide away

So I can be away from the madness
Far from the noise and the darkness
It's not too late, there's gotta be a way
For me to escape all this nonsense
Get away

I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away

They try to run my life but that's the way I live
Do what I wanna do, 'cause it's my perrogative
People always trippin' about the things I say
But I'm living for the future and I'm doing things my way

So why does the world just keep on doggin me
I have to leave it all behind
'cause there's gotta be a way
For me to escape all this nonsense
To get away

I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away

Yo check the groove
B's kicking a flow
Real smooth
E double S-S
With some cess
And it's a necessity to move
So hit it where ya fit in and let the rythm snatch ya
Throw a good rhyme so watch what's coming at ya
As I release another Brown batch of jams
That slam
And you can't touch so scram
I know you cram to understand
Who I am, damn by the way can I please get this dance?
Let's not free lance 'cause I'm just getting started
Believe me that was nothing but a Brown party
That's going on and got it going on
Bob and Ted'd rated number one so flow on it
And if you're in the house, pump your fists and say
Ho! (Ho!)
Say ho, ho! (Ho, ho!)
Ted, bring me on back, bring me on back
Dance!
There it is, oh!

I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
I've got to get away, I've got to get away
Never in my life
Have I ever felt that something just ain't right
Baby
Baby
Tired of all this mess
Unhapiness
I guess it's I just gotta get away
Gotta get away
I don't wanna hurt nobody
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
Please somebody
It just don't feel right
Baby I can't sleep at night
I need a peace of mind
Far away from the darkness
And you know it's
I need someone
To take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away baby
Please B Brown is outta here
Coast

===== Bobby Brown - Every Little Step =====
Good lovin'
Ow, yeah

I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn
Listening for the telephone
But when I get your call, I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is like a dream come true
A real life fantasy

No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that

Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together

I can't think too straight, I'm all confused
You must've put a thing on me
Because there aren't no words that can explain
I'm livin' in ecstasy
And you can best believe, I got your back
You never have to feel no pain
'Cause I'll dedicate my life to you
You'll never look for love again

No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
We'll always be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that

Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together

Every little (Woo)
Every little step I (Every little step)
Every little, every little step I take (Oh no)
Every little
Every little step I (Every little step)
Every little, we'll be together, girl
Good lovin'
Good lovin'

No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, it's like that, girl

Every little step I take, you will be there (You'll, you'll be there)
Every little step I make, we'll be together
Every little step I take, you will be there (You, you'll be there)
Every little step I make, we'll be together

Every little step I take (Oh no), you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together (You, you'll be there)
Every little step I take (Every step), you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together (We will be together)

Every little
Every little step I (Every little step)
Every little, every little step I take (Oh no)
Every little
Every little step I (Every little step)
Every little, we'll be together, girl
Every little step I take (Good lovin'), you will be there
Every little step I make, we'll be together

===== Bobby Brown - Don't Be Cruel =====
Girl, the only thing that matters in my life
Is that I'm down for you and treat you right
You've got no cause to treat me cold as ice

Oh, oh, oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my love to you
You should be giving me your love too, oh
But you just keep on acting just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Don't be cruel, 'cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no
Don't be cruel
Girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh, uh don't be cruel

Hey, yo, cutie what's up with this attitude?
I thought I was being real good to you
I treat you sweet, take you out at night
But you never say thanks, girl, that ain't right
I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high-post but you play me close
And if I put a drink up, you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from nine to five
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied

Oh, oh, oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my heart to you
You should be giving me your heart too, oh
But you just keep on acting just like a fool
You know it ain't cool

Don't be cruel, 'cause I would never be that cruel to you
Uh no, oh oh, no
Don't be cruel
Girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh, uh, don't be cruel

From fancy cars to diamond rings
I've just about given you everything
There's really not much I won't do for you
I bought you twelve yellow roses and candy too
I like to be up front and never play the back
But the way you treat me girl is like a heart attack
I'm a real troop trooper aiming for the top
And with you by my side, d-dollars I will clock

Oh, oh, oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my love to you
You should be giving me your love too, oh
But you just keep on acting just like a fool
You know it ain't cool
It just ain't cool (Hoo)
Don't be cruel
I know, oh

We used to hang out tough, just kickin' around
We discovered a love that had never been found
You gave me your heart, I gave you my mind
But a true love affair we could never find
Although I want you bad I could let you go
'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no
Lo to the fact that I want you, Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see
But you had to start illin', tryna make a killin'
Thought about the dollars I make and you were willing
To be with me, Bobby B
But with a bad attitude I can't compete
Now you know my name, now I know your game
You want to be with me you got to be the same way
That another girl would be, and if you wanna be with me

Don't be cruel (Don't be, don't be), 'cause I would never be that cruel to you
(Don't be, don't be, baby)
Uh no, oh oh, no
Don't be cruel (Don't be, don't be)
Girl, you need to change your attitude
Uh no, oh, uh, don't be cruel
Don't be cruel (Don't be, don't be), 'cause I would never be that cruel to you
(Don't be, don't be, baby)
Uh no, oh oh, no
Don't be cruel (Don't be, don't be)

You ain't got no trustin' about you
And you claim that you
Don't care what where I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you

Say you trust someone
Why are you calling all around
Think I've got some dip on the side
Girl, you don't trust no one
And you're constantly in doubt
You lose the game if you play that way

Get up off my back (Get off)

No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way

When you love someone
And you wanna love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
And you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you

Say that you love someone
Why you calling all my friends
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl, you don't love no one
You don't know what love's about
You lose the game if you, if you play that way, yeah

You lose all your clout and
You lose the game, baby, if you play that way, yeah
Back to the B-B-Brown

My name is Brown, that's what I'm called, so
Don't try to step to be wrong or you'll fall slow
'Cause I just wanna kick soul to ya
Maybe, baby, take control of ya just like I told ya
I wanna roll
On the tip that's smooth and
Gonna make ya move and groove and
Leaves ya like "ooh" when I touch ya
Give ya so much of
The feeling of the deck that I'm dealin'
When I rub ya up and down
Yo Stylz, kick it

Well, I know it's been a while
Since you heard a change in a style
So what I'm gonna do is kick in something fly and new
A change, this one from the typical
A bit more than regular, I'm not like the others, original
'Cause originality and creativity
Added up together equals the BBB Posse
Yeah, we in the house, yo, kick it

Get up off my back (Come on)
Save your heart attack (Come on)
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(Throw your hands in the air, come on, come on)
No matter what they say
No, it ain't that way
(I can make you bounce)
Ain't nobody humpin' around

Girl, you said you love me
And you said you trust me
Why you think I'm foolin' around?
I can't stand the pressure
You know I'm yours forever
Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody humpin' around, baby

Get up off my back (Uh)
Save your heart attack (Ow)
Ain't nobody humpin' around
(Come on, everybody, let's go)
No matter what they say

===== Doja Cat - Kiss Me More =====
We hug and, yes, we make love
And always just say goodnight (La-la-la-la-la-la)
And we cuddle, sure, I do love it
But I need your lips on mine

Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothin' to lose, oh-oh
It's just principle
Baby, hold me 'cause I like the way you groove, oh-oh

Boy, you write your name, I can do the same
Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it (La-la-la-la-la-la)

I, I feel like fuckin' somethin'
But we could be corny, fuck it
Sugar, I ain't no dummy, dummy
I likе to say, "What if?" But if
We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, give me two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

Can you kiss me more?

Oh, I love the taste, la-la-la-la-la-la
All on my tongue, I want it

Push the limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fuckin' with you feel like jail, nigga (Feel like jail)
I can't even exhale, nigga (Exhale)
Pussy like holy grail, you know that (Holy grail)
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dippin' with your friend
You ain't even half, man, lyin' on your ****, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real (All this ass)
Drama make you feel (Make you feel)
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you

And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh

And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry

Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm a surprise
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)

Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yeah)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)

He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it

My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (Yeah, ah)
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo

Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' (Ah)
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask "Whose is it?"
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah

KSR
It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

Said, "Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, "Goals," bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, "Okay"
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

Said, "Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

Said, "Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you

===== Cardi B - Thru Your Phone =====
Look, I just want to break up all your shit
Call your mama phone, let her know that she raised a bitch
Then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake-ass friends
Comin' round actin' like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram? Lil' bitch
I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feelin', it turns out you lie to me
I'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me
How you out fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

My heart is beating like it's bleedin' out
You sleepin', you sleepin', you sleepin'
You sleepin' like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
You creepin', you creepin', you creepin'

I went through your phone last night
I went through your phone last night
Saw some things I didn't like
I went through your phone last night
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me, oh

All I can see is you and her in different scenarios
Beyoncé on my stereo, "Resentment" on repeat
I'ma make you a bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
Serve it to you like, "Here you go, nigga, bon appétit"
Look, did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a ho from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no bad bitches
This shit is eatin' me, you sleepin' peacefully
Gettin' more mad at you, thinkin' 'bout stabbin' you
Don't even know that you this close to dyin'
You gon' wake up like, "Why you got an attitude?"

My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
You sleepin', you sleepin', you sleepin'
You sleepin' like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
You creepin', you creepin', you creepin'

I went through your phone last night

===== Cardi B - Get Up 10 =====
Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said "dance" not "fuck", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get it at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said "I was just tryna chill and make bangers" (Bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (Stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (Brrrt)
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? (Who?)
I think y'all got your story screwed up (Yeah)
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough (Facts)
I'm the one that's killin' shit, hands down (Hands down)
If you got a problem with me, say it now (Say it)
'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissin' (Huh?)
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on go like I don't see no stop lights (Skrrt)
I'm steppin' out every day, prom night (Facts)
So if it's all love, show me love then (Huh?)
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (Brrrt, woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (No)
I smack you and the bitch that you act like (Yeah)
I started gettin' money, bitches upset (Cash)
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair laid, keep 'em both laced (Laced)
Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face (Shine)
He-headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitch spittin' like this since '08
I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch (Fear no bitch)
Whole life been through some fucked up shit (Fucked up shit)
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you see what I've seen, you end up like this (Woo)
I walked into the label, "Where the check at?" ("Where the check?")
Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? (Where?)
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild (I act wild, wild)
I'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child (Bad ass child, skrrt)
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now (Try that now)
Cardi B, know it's me, hear that "blap" sound (Blap!)

Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win

You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt"
Dreams pullin' up, I'm like "skrrt"
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like

I'm like Big Pop' mixed with 2Pac, I'm like Makaveli (Yeah)

Nigga, you a pussy and a rat, you like Tom and Jerry
Nigga, you ain't ballin', you just talkin', that's that commentary (Huh)
I was in the field, man, I slaved for this (Yeah)
Had to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this
To my surprise, He replied, said, "You made for this"
I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash
Hit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash
"#CardiBIsSoProblematic" is the hashtag

They talkin' junk and they stink, these hoes mad trash

But she trappin' and she had to make it happen for her life
Don't be mad because she havin', shit, you had it your whole life

Hair when it's fucked up, crib when it's filthy
Way-before-the-deal me, strip-to-pay-the-bills me
'Fore I fixed my teeth, man, those comments used to kill me
But never did I change, never been ashamed
Never did I switch, story stayed the same
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Y'all gotta bear with me, I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets
Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes said I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyoncé, I met Mama Knowles
I'm the rose that came from the concrete and arose
I'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ayy

===== Doechii - DENIAL IS A RIVER =====
Hey, I thought it was all over
What's up, Doechii?
Hey, girl
You know it's been a lil' minute since you and I have had a chat
Has it really?
Probably since, like, your last EP, 'Oh the Places You'll Go'
Oh wow, it's been a minute, yeah (Yeah)
I've been gettin' some calls
Oh?
People are a little bit worried about you
Not worried, okay
And I know that I was kinda that outlet for you, so
You were
Why don't you just tell me what's been goin' on?
Okay

Remember old dude from 2019?
Nice, clean, nigga did me dirtier than laundry (Than laundry)
Took a scroll through his IG
Just to get a DM from his wifey (What the fuck?)
I was so confused, what should Doechii do?
She didn't know about me and I didn't know 'bout Sue
I open up the messages and had to hit the zoom
Turns out the girl was really a dude? (Goddamn)
Nigga think he slicked back 'til I slipped back
Got my lick back, turned a nigga to a knick-knack (To a knick-knack)
I moved on, dropped a couple of songs
And then I went and got signed, now it's 2021

Okay, I just feel like
This is the perfect opportunity for us to just take a second and kind of unpack what's happened to you
You know, this guy cheated on you, and—
Mm, nah (Oh), fuck it

"Platinum record" this, "viral record" that (That)
I'm makin' so much money, I'm all over the net
I'm movin' so fast, no time to process
And no, I'm not in a gang, but I'm always on set (Yeah)
Wrist watch, drip drop, label want the TikToks
Now I'm makin' TikTok music, what thee fuck?
I need a cleanse, need a detox
But we ain't got time to stop, the charts need us (And they do)
Fast forward, me, 2023
I'm stackin' lots of cheese and makin' money
My grass is really green, and—

Honestly, I can't even fucking cap no more, this is a really dark time for me
I'm going through a lot
By "a lot," you mean drugs?
Um, I wouldn't—
Drugs?
No, it's a—
No?
It's a natural plant
No, I'm not judging
I'm not an addict
I'm just saying
I don't think—
You wanna talk about it?
Uh

I mean, fuck, I like pills, I like drugs
I like gettin' money, I like strippers, I like to fuck
I like day-drinkin' and day parties and Hollywood
I like doin' Hollywood shit, snort it? Probably would
What can I say? The shit works, it feels good
And my self-worth's at an all-time low
And just when it couldn't get worse
My ex crashed my place and destroyed all I owned
Whoopsie, made a oopsie
One-hundred thousand dollar "oops" made me loopy
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Don't wanna have to turn a nigga guts into soup beans

Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah (Rurr)
Okay, Doechii
We don't wanna revert back into our old ways (Sorry, okay)
So, we're gonna try a breathing exercise, okay? (Alright, word)
When I breathe, you breathe (Okay, okay)
Alright? Let's go

I showed the bitch my pen, then I schooled her
Shout out ese them and my chulas
Doechii the Don, Doechii the dean
Doechii supreme, the Swamp Ruler

Freaky lil', sneaky lil', creepy lil' whack bitch
Creepin' on me, speakin' on me, sleepin' on me, mattress
Now I got some bands to burn and bars to bend 'em backwards
It's time to wake em up 'causе they been sleepin' on the tracklist
Body so attractive
Y'all bе giving catfish
Log 'em off the web and every gangsta's giving actress
Gangsta's giving actress and all these fake activists

===== Doechii - Yucky Blucky Fruitcake =====
Doechii, why don't you introduce yourself to the class? Okay?

Hi, my name's Doechii with two I's
I feel anxious when I'm high (Huh)
Teachers say I talk too much
Momma say I don't talk enough
In the dark, I'm like a torch
From the hood, I hopped the porch
I don't bang or slang, on gang
But my dada keep them thangs

Speak up
Speak up
Speak up
Speak

I get a little violent when I play the game of tag
I get a little quiet when I think about the bag
I slob when I sleep, and I wake up with a drag
I'm pulling out my teeth, so I wake up to the cash
This is who I am from the back to the front
I never had to pay for my schoolhouse lunch
My mama used stamps 'cause she need a little help
But a nigga made do with the cards been dealt
I try to act smart 'cause I want a lot of friends
I never really went with the flow of the trends
I think I like girls, but I think I like men
Doechii is a dick, I never fit in
Overly cocky, I'm hyper-ambitious
Me, me, me, me, bitch, I'm narcin-uh-ssistic
I am a Black girl who beat the statistics
Fuck the opinions and all the logistics, haha

Speak up (Wow, ha)
Speak up (Wow)
Speak up (Well, Doechii, why don't you tell us what you do in your spare time?)
Speak

I'm all alone on the deep dark web
Me and my phone in this queen-size bed
I'm looking at my pillow, my pillow look back at me
My thumb is over the screen, the other is in my jeans
It took a second to soak, my fingers inside my throat
I paused, and then, I choked to think about it some more
Connection is moving slow, my brightness is on that low
I'm reaching for the remote, then my mama bust through the door (Shit)

Doechii (Doechii), Doechii (Doechii)
You forgot to take the chicken out (You forgot to take the chicken out)
Doechii (Doechii)
You forgot to take the chicken out
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do)
Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin'
Somethin', somethin', somethin' (Ooh)
Ooh

I fuck with Junie B., Barbara was my idol
Had to wear my attitude to every dance recital
In my black Taylor Chucks, the ones that laced up
To my thighs, Lisa Frank lipstick on my eyes
Weird girl activity, Black bitch nativity
Spy girl erotica, bucket hat from Nautica
Clit throbbing, I start sobbing watching Narnia
I been winning trophies since Fear Factor
I was earning medals the same rate you basic bitches learned how to use protractors
Foot been on their necks before chiropractor
But I gave all the game boys cooties
Most of y'all are the type of kids I'd hate
If I was the monster under your beds, you'd be the kids I ate
If I was a man your mom fucked, I'd fuck her right in your face
And take you and your siblings on a Domino's pizza date
Damn, Gen X baby going crazy with the cam
Back when I was rhyming on my Green Eggs and Ham
Edited my pictures with the Microsoft filters
I was making Trillers way before they called 'em "Trillers"
Sixth grade, every nigga pressured me to fuck
While y’all was givin' it up, I was servin' looks
Custom-made drip with the pastry couture
Selling Silly Bandz from my desk to my drawer
Singing karaoke while my mom was at the store ("You are")
Scared that she would walk in on me singing Paramore ("The only exception")
While y'all was sticking house keys in motherfucking sockets ("You are")
I was stuffing all y’all lunch moneys in my pocket
Please, stop it
I'm in to blow up like the white thing that soda rockets
Talking back to my teachers, I'm out of pocket
Got so much shit on my chest, yo, I need to drop it
Dribbling inside my journal, kiss my locket
Let the paper soak my tears up, Ultra Charmin
Ooh, I need to let it out (Let it out)
I gotta let it out (Let it out)

Uninvited and I'm undercover
Undivided, undiscovered
Uninvited and I'm undercover
But I never liked 'em, forever fuck 'em

Wow, haha
That was quite the introduction, Doechii
Everybody, give it up for Doechii
(That was really inappropriate)
Give it up for Doechii
(Did she say "Food stamps"?)
Okay, we're going to have to have a talk after class, okay?

===== Doechii - Nosebleeds =====
You salty-ass bitches givin' Lawry's
Bad gyal Doechii, call her Michael Lowrey
Yeah, you hoes is funny, you should do comedy
Leave your ass leakin', lookin' like my monthlies

I don't know, is she gonna go crazy? Is she gonna go crazy?
Everybody wanted to know what Doechii would do if she didn't win
I guess we'll never—

Stepped out the swamp to the motherfuckin' stage (Ho)
Cut my mic off 'cause I'm 'bout to misbehave (Hah)
"Will she ever lose?" Man, I guess we'll never know
"Will she lose hеr cool?" I guess we'll nevеr—
I hopped out the swamp, gave the bitch props
"Doechii, where you been?" "Doechii went pop"
"Will she ever lose?" Man, I guess we'll never know
"Will she lose her cool?" I guess we'll never—

I guess we'll never know
Guess we'll never see the day that Doechii crown falls
Guess you'll never live to see the day that Doechii loses
Do-si-doin' on these Doechii mutants
Doechii don't critique, I seek improvement

Right now is my time and my moment
Thank you to my swamp and thank you, God, I was broke
I thanks you, God, I thank you to Top God Entertainment
Oop, Top Dawg Entertainment
SZA, Zay, Moosa, and the hatin'-ass stans
Mommy, Blake High School, and all the bitches I surpassed
I knew it
Tonight, we poppin' bottles, fuckin' hoes, and forgettin' our name
To the audience wonderin' how it feels to be famous?
I guess you'll never—

Stepped out the swamp to the motherfuckin' stage (Ho)
Cut my mic off 'cause I'm 'bout to misbehave (Hah)
"Will she ever lose?" Man, I guess we'll never know
"Will she lose her cool?" I guess we'll never—

These bitches can't be half of me, thanks to my anatomy
Showin' up an hour late like, "Thanks to the Academy"
Now I understand why they mad at me and hate on my anatomy
It's 'cause I look good from the balcony
I look good from the nosebleeds, bitch
If you offended, you ain't know me, bitch
That ain't Doechii, that's the old Chii, sis
I look good from the nosebleeds, bitch

I've been at a place where it was hard as it could get
If you never suffered, you could never tell me shit
And I can have a million and still would hit the lick
Lifestyle, nigga, this my lifestyle, guess you'll never know

===== Doechii - Alter Ego =====

2910 East Genesee Street
Where niggas mix weed with they nicotine treats
I wish I had a soda and a dime piece, bitch
So I could just kick back and sip my lime in peace
Easy, breezy, beautiful, erratic
Scatter-minded, manic, borderline addict
I try to take the sober route and end up on a dead-end
Now everything I jokе about just ends up on a Reddit
Gator skin coat, Florida heat no jokе
Feel like the Tiger King, these bitches want mo' Joe
Leo, the sun sign, I'm sippin' a Cosmo
Make money like pronto and Gucci my poncho
Ain't no rain or paint on me
Niggas wettin' up the block, but ain't a stain on me
Label always up my ass like anal beads
Why can't all these label niggas just let me be?
Let me breathe, niggas want me R.I.P
I been resting with my peace and that's the irony
I'm a dying sunflower leaving a trail of seeds
In the 813, this my legacy

It's a sunny day
The gang's all here
No chip on my shoulder
A-ha-ha-ha-ha

You know we be wildin', wildin', wildin'
You know we get violent, violent, violent
You don't wanna try this, try this, try this
You know we be wildin', wildin', wildin'
You know we be wildin', wildin', wildin'
You know we get violent, violent, violent
You don't wanna try this, try this, try this

By the time you hear this, I'll have taken on another form
The way I've been snapping, y'all gon' end up my children of the corn
I think I've adapted to all of the cannibal savages
I feel a possession in this session, I need a Catholic
To assess it, come and bless it and undress it, pussy precious
She a fetish, she get deadly, Armageddon, I want D Day
Then I'ma get it, he don't get it, he regret it, coochie vegan
It's a veggie, come and eat this coochie dressing, Iamdoechii
I am legend, don't shoot me, just get the message
You got beef, then, bitch, address it
UPS it, I'm too young to be this restless
Eat you bitches, shit you out through my fucking large intestine
I spit bars that make you quit, I insist that you respect it
Save your music, keep it close, I suggest that you protect it
When I'm in the studio, I go Jason, I go Freddy
Slice you bitches in your bedding, shoot your mammy and your daddy
At your wedding, I been waitin', I been ready, disappear like
I'm a Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti-Yeti...
I go off like PMS, you still rap like you the S
Work them checks like BTS, pay in full or thank you, next
I don't come to play or flex, when I rap, I step on necks
My bars feel like S-E-X, they book me like SOS
I told 'em once, I told 'em once, I guess I'll tell 'em twice
I’m on the run, another one, I'm in it for the ride
Ayy, fuck the fame and fuck the hoes, I do it for the vibe
They want me dead but I still do it in another life

===== Doechii - BULLFROG =====
Titties sitting up high, Miss Nigga, tough guy
Sipping on a Mai Tai, money on a uprise
Left, right, uppercut, punchlines make 'em duck
Write hooks, up the cut, platinum hits, fuck is up?
Pop star, rock star, dark skin bitch
24-inch waist, mandingo dick
Do you wanna take a ride on my ego trip?
Slow down when you riding this ego stick, ya dig?

Like a cable, we jump hoes
If a bitch feeling froggy, tell her, "Hop out, bitch"
Like a cable, we jump hoes
Twitter fingers get your whole life logged out, bitch

I'm, oh, so expensive
So addictive, you get no attention
Bitches ain't fucking with me
I make pensions, nigga's penny-pinching
Okay, cha-ching, I coppеd a new ring
Fuck a new boy, new toy, I need a nеw fling
Cop the Trojan condom with grooves, we get to grooving
We get to moving, my lil' yeah-yeah, my side boo thing
After the woo-woo, he get to boosting
Put the nigga on the block, he bring me back my loose change
Pimpcess with some nice tits, pussy on the nice list
All y'all frog-ass hoes should hop off my—

===== Doechii - STANKA POOH =====
Let's start the story backwards
I'm dead, she's dead, just another Black Lives Mattered
And if I died today, I'd die a bastard
TikTok rapper, part time YouTube actor
Pop my shit then a muscle relaxer
Intergalacter, worldwide capper
I dirty shoes and put 'em back in the box
Like voilà, the Looney Tunes back in stock
I'm Little Miss Stanka Pooh, little Miss Who Are You?
Little loose screw, fur hat with the kangaroo
Who woulda knew? Who'da thunk it?
Who'da got the ball from Big Moo and who'da dunk it?
If this relationship was left up to you, you'da sunk it
Talkin' out my ass and that's my assumption, but
That's my conjunction
I'm runnin' back to you like a fat kid at luncheon, plеase

I'd swallow my pride beforе I choke on my greed
Show you my cards before I'd gamble my seat, uh
Fuck are we talkin' about? What's the discussion?
Sharing memes with the chairman over some English muffins
I'm just shootin' the shit over some pretty production
And it's still not enough of somethin', needs more somethin'-somethin'
Who's that creepin' through my rearview? (Thirty-somethin')
I'm not nervous, I'm just concerned for us
What if I die a Taurus? What if I die on purpose?
What if it wasn't even worth it? What if I'm walkin' alone?
What if I choke on this Slurpee? What if I make it big?
What if my car exploded while I'm casually pumping the gas and smokin' a cig?
What if my life was loaded? Loaded pile of shit
Whole lotta pussy and a whole lotta dick
Whole lotta bills and a whole lotta kids
That's it

And if those the only fears that I'll take to my grave
I'm pissin' on you hoes, livin' or dead

Feel it's the season I should let go
And that's the reason I'ma buy more
Feel it's the season I should fly solo
I'm so sedated and she so persuasive
This isolation, so sweet you could taste it
Wake-bake in the mornin', moonlight, y'all be yawnin'

If it's weed, on sight, then it's all okay
Moods alright if we all gettin' paid
Socks on thigh and we all too high
To be not okay, to be not on key (How does it feel to be you?)
All night long, goin' all damn day
Ninety-nine hoes, bet all dem gays
Sun gon' shine and they all gon' grind
'Til they all get fine and they all get shaded
All of them persuaded you to be my baby
Weezy We "F" Baby and the F is for "faded"
Snortin' lines like eighties and we so flirtatious

===== Doechii - DEATH ROLL =====
Speed the freeway when I need a breeze, ayy
Wine and Chinese when I feel uneasy
Fall to my knees, take a line, I needed a boost
Stumble inside of the booth, mumbling none of the truth
As sweat drips down my tits
I contemplate, how'd it ever get like this?
I contemplate, how'd I ever get this rich or get this bag?
I wonder what them labels see in a bitch this black
I wonder what my friends all think when I'm not there (Ah, ah)
I love the way my ideas flow when I'm not scared (Hah, hah)
I lovе the way my hips roll slow
But I don't like the way it feels whеn my vices are absent, I'm not there

I wonder, I wonder, I wonder

Sleep all day, all night, no time to work, work
Ex my fiancé, can't make it work, work
Bad bitches get burned, but now that bridge is burned
And when them tables turn, ya can't call back (Back)
Ring-ring, got that call but I can't call back (Call)
Feeling all alone and I can't stall that (Oh, no)
I got shit to prove, no time to fall back (Fall, fall, fall, fall)
Fall back, fall for who is where ya left that
I wonder what's the point, I wonder why fight? (Fights)
I go to light the joint, I wonder why light? (Why light)
I feel so ig'nant, sick of being friendly
Being friendly only bring bad business (Bad bid'ness)
If repetition is the master's practice (Practice)
Then I'm a mathematician when it comes to fashion (Fashion)
Doechii-ana giving trash couture
Your fit is a detour, I'm not none of these whores

I wonder, I wonder, I wonder

Lost friends, shed just like loose skin
I lost friends and lost kin closer than him, these loose ends
I'd rather choose me over them
These loose ends or a hymn when I'm bleeding and I'm fading out
You know I gotta up that stock, I gotta up my profit when I'm outside
Keep my composure when I'm outside sober, gotta up my profit

===== Doechii - DENIAL IS A RIVER =====
Hey, I thought it was all over
What's up, Doechii?
Hey, girl
You know it's been a lil' minute since you and I have had a chat
Has it really?
Probably since, like, your last EP, 'Oh the Places You'll Go'
Oh wow, it's been a minute, yeah (Yeah)
I've been gettin' some calls
Oh?
People are a little bit worried about you
Not worried, okay
And I know that I was kinda that outlet for you, so
You were
Why don't you just tell me what's been goin' on?
Okay

Remember old dude from 2019?
Nice, clean, nigga did me dirtier than laundry (Than laundry)
Took a scroll through his IG
Just to get a DM from his wifey (What the fuck?)
I was so confused, what should Doechii do?
She didn't know about me and I didn't know 'bout Sue
I open up the messages and had to hit the zoom
Turns out the girl was really a dude? (Goddamn)
Nigga think he slicked back 'til I slipped back
Got my lick back, turned a nigga to a knick-knack (To a knick-knack)
I moved on, dropped a couple of songs
And then I went and got signed, now it's 2021

Okay, I just feel like
This is the perfect opportunity for us to just take a second and kind of unpack what's happened to you
You know, this guy cheated on you, and—
Mm, nah (Oh), fuck it

"Platinum record" this, "viral record" that (That)
I'm makin' so much money, I'm all over the net
I'm movin' so fast, no time to process
And no, I'm not in a gang, but I'm always on set (Yeah)
Wrist watch, drip drop, label want the TikToks
Now I'm makin' TikTok music, what thee fuck?
I need a cleanse, need a detox
But we ain't got time to stop, the charts need us (And they do)
Fast forward, me, 2023
I'm stackin' lots of cheese and makin' money
My grass is really green, and—

Honestly, I can't even fucking cap no more, this is a really dark time for me
I'm going through a lot
By "a lot," you mean drugs?
Um, I wouldn't—
Drugs?
No, it's a—
No?
It's a natural plant
No, I'm not judging
I'm not an addict
I'm just saying
I don't think—
You wanna talk about it?
Uh

I mean, fuck, I like pills, I like drugs
I like gettin' money, I like strippers, I like to fuck
I like day-drinkin' and day parties and Hollywood
I like doin' Hollywood shit, snort it? Probably would
What can I say? The shit works, it feels good
And my self-worth's at an all-time low
And just when it couldn't get worse
My ex crashed my place and destroyed all I owned
Whoopsie, made a oopsie
One-hundred thousand dollar "oops" made me loopy
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Don't wanna have to turn a nigga guts into soup beans

Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah (Rurr)
Okay, Doechii
We don't wanna revert back into our old ways (Sorry, okay)
So, we're gonna try a breathing exercise, okay? (Alright, word)
When I breathe, you breathe (Okay, okay)
Alright? Let's go
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-ah
Uh, uh, uh, ah
Uh, uh, uh, uh, ah
Uh, uh, uh, uh, ah, woosah

===== Doechii - WAIT =====
No need to bring fall back in August, September
You should just fall back and wait (Wait, wait)
Who wants to clear the fog and all the smog in your mirrors
When you could just fall back and wait? (Wait, wait, wait)
Delete your call log and clear your agenda
You should just eat what's on your plate (Woo, woo)

What do you think would happen? You wait on it like a laxative
Life is just like a settlement, waiting for you to cash on it
Life is just like a bike, it don't move unless you pedaling
Less about who is better and more 'bout who blessing them
Softer than gelatin, peanuts to elephants
You dumb as a box of rocks if you think it's irrelevant
My granny been poppin' Xannies since CBS met The Nanny
My mammy dandy, she chipper than Annie and I'm not talkin' a family
But I's been dreamin' of fishes since I been watching the Grammys
And I'm here to stay like the shit in your panties
I need some standing ovations since y'all can't seem to understand me
I might look fly in the matrix, I hope I'm sticking my landing

No need to bring fall back in August, September (September)
You should just fall back and wait (Wait, wait)

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Da-da-da-da-da)

Hope I'm comin' off chill, hope I'm keepin' it real
Hope that people feel safe when they enter my crib
Still a baby by day, bad bitch by night
Still applying my gloss from red to green light
Niggas callin' my phone, bitches callin' my phone (My phone)
Private callin' my phone (My phone), blockin' you off my phone (My phone)
Bill collectors, roach and bug inspectors calling my phone (My phone)
Who you checkin' if I'm disrespecting you with my tone? (My tone)

No need to bring fall back in August, September (September)

Y'all calling me crazy

Long hair, this wavy
And a bitch been shopping all day, no Macy's
"Hop out, First Lady"
You niggas can't date me, look at your savings
You niggas still waiting
Still blowing out daisies, counting on daydreams

Crazy, got 'em going crazy (Huh)
None of these hating ass bitches gon' phase me (Like Jay-Z, huh)
Crazy, got 'em going crazy (Huh)
None of these hating ass bitches gon' phase me (No better, no crazy)

Then I ball like Spalding
Can't call my bluff when the shit is my calling
Won't duck bitch, I'm all in
It's a brand new day, new pace, light joggin'
Straight facts, no jargon
It's a whole lot of big blue checks, no login
Low stress, no stallin'
See a whole lot of big bouquets when I fall in

I'm going crazy, yeah
Niggas can’t date me, yeah
Look at your savings, yeah
Got 'em going crazy, yeah
Look at your savings
Niggas can't date me

Niggas can’t date me, yeah
Look at your savings, yeah
Got 'em going crazy, yeah
Look at your savings

A bitch gassed like a Texaco
I mean, a bitch off shore, like a Mexico
And if a bitch unsure, I can letcha know
I mean, I stick to the point like a decimal
And that's co-co nuts, crazy amazing
Bookoo Bucks, fuck you, pay me
Awful luxury fucking saved me
Who knew you'd go fucking crazy?

Crazy, got 'em going crazy (Huh)
None of these hating ass bitches gon' phase me (Like Jay-Z, huh)

I could be on my pockets and my shoulder
All day, the neighbors gon' watch me do, do

You gotta understand, the path that you going on, everybody can't go
And you can't take everybody where you going
You remember I used to talk to you about the story about Abraham and Lot
And how he wanted to take Lot with him?
Everybody can't go where you going

And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearin' less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need, my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Goin' places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Runnin' out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rollin' up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touchin' road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling

Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low

Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for

With your phone out, gotta hit them angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright (Alright!)
It's a short life, yeah

Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

Without a follow, without a mention
You really pipin' up on these niggas
You gotta be nice for what to these niggas?

===== Drake - Too Good =====
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

Look, I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah
These days, I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
Yeah

And last night, I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately, you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you

And last night, I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix (Six)
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted

Yeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack

Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)

When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race

===== Drake - Laugh Now Cry Later =====
Woah, woah
Yeah

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me
We should be (Yeah)
Senseless sight to see
Yeah
Senseless sight to see
Ayy

Feelin' young, but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosey
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'

I'm outside, 29, G5, Seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, Frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me

Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party, uh
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started
I don't know who love me, but I know that it ain't everybody
I can never love her, she a busybody
Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah
Can't be fuckin' on just anybody, yeah
I got feelings for you, that's the thing about it, yeah
You know that it's somethin' when I sing about it, yeah
Mama used to be on disability but gave me this ability
And now she walkin' with her head high and her back straight
I don't think you feelin' me, I'm out here
Bein' everything they said I wouldn't be and couldn't be
I don't know what happened to them guys that said they would be
I said see you at the top and they misunderstood me
I hold no resentment in my heart, that's that maturity
And we don't keep it on us anymore, it's with security

I'm outside (Yeah), 29 (Yeah), G5, Seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, Frontline, Southside (Southside)
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me

I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me (I'm trying)
Senseless sight to see
Senseless sight to see (Outside)

Rollin' 84s, it ain't no safety
Ridin' rich and wavy
Gotta roll over to you, gotta get my release
Spread your legs downtown as I'm goin' out to eat
Even hear the raw sounds when that raw got me in sleep (Oh, oh)
I'ma roll on 'em 'fore I ever let 'em roll on me
Split this one down the middle, wake up in the harmony (Sick)
Worried sick, I'm sick of worryin' (Sick, sick)
It's just the world we in, I'd rather bury them
I'm talkin' fake friends and skeletons (Yeah)
Early-mornin' shoulder rubs, the lawyer sounding celebrant (It's lit)
I'm never settlin', this shit get darker than my melanin (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
At the crib all by myself, this shit been cavin' in
Scrollin' through my call log, by emojis, how I'm savin' 'em
Them heart eyes, that peach one, my old ones, but I favorite them
That butterfly emoji hold me down and all my babies them (Yeah)
Purple demon face one push away, he got the K on him
I broke bread instead of watchin' niggas break down (Break it)
And saved a couple bitches too like I'm from Cape Town
Know their position, you know ass up with the face down (Let's go)
I'm never content, two mil' a event, I get it frequent
I'm make an expense, to me, it's just cents
I'm droppin' the top, not to feel the wind
I'm droppin' the top 'cause bro tryna spin
She droppin' her top, she back again
Publicly she at the crib again, company (Yeah, yeah)
I let it slide when I really shoulda slid (Ooh, ooh)
After all the shit I did
Look at how they repayin' me back (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Now follow my rift
Tell me what type of payment is that? (Oh, oh-oh) I put that on my kid
And my trust, yeah, it is what it is (Oh, oh)

I'm outside (Ah), 29, G5 (Ah), Seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace (Ah)
But honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, Frontline, Southside (Southside)
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace (Oh, oh)
Honestly, that sound like a fair trade to me

I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me
We should be, senseless sight to see
Senseless sight to see
Up on a mountain (Up on a mountain)
Search through the valley (Search through the valley)
You hear me calling (You hear me calling)
Won't you come find me? (Won't you come find me?)
Please don't forsake me (Please don't forsake me)
All of a sudden (All of a sudden)
My heart is breaking (Breaking)
I feel it coming, I, I

===== Drake - Rich Flex =====
Go buy a zip of weed, hit the club

Can you talk to the opps necks for me? (Okay)
21, do your thing 21, do your thing (21)
Do your thing, 21, do your thing

Yellow diamonds in the watch, this shit cost a lot
Never send a bitch your dot, that's how you get shot
I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that shit a lot
Took her panties off and this bitch thicker than the plot
All my exes ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your period, baby, can you suck it?
I'm a savage (21)
Smack her booty in Magic (21, 21)
I'll slap a pussy nigga with a ratchet (Pussy)
I might slap a tracker on his whip and get the addy (Pussy)
Don't call me on Christmas Eve, bitch, call your daddy (21)
Bitch, call your uncle (21), bitch, don't call me (21)
Always in my ear, your ho a flea (Fuck)
Why my opps be posting guns and only use they feet? (21)
Paid like an athlete, I got—

All you hoes, all of you hoes need to remember who y'all talkin' to
It's a Slaughter Gang CEO
I got dick for you if I'm not workin', girl
If I'm busy then fuck no
You need to find you someone else to call
When your bank account get low, you need to find you someone—


Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm on that Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit, ayy

Sticks and stones, chrome on chrome
That's just what a nigga on
Internet clones, got 'em kissin' through the phone
Pussies cliquin' up so they don't feel alone, ayy
Nan' nigga seein' me, I'm Young Money CMB
I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB
The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND
I'm steady pushin' P, you niggas pushing PTSD
I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing B&E
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then it's BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin' every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P. to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late
21 my addy, so the knife is on the gate
All the dawgs eatin' off a Baccarat plate
Niggas see Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie ass mistake, ayy

Ah, what? What?
Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
On God
Boy, look, you the motherfuckin' man, boy, you, ooh
You is the man, you hear me?

===== Drake - Wants and Needs =====
(Six)
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us

Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter (Skrrt)
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out "YOLO," yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of

Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

===== Drake - Teenage Fever =====
Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been 'cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, so
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind, so

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
Yeah, slightly, huh, took a left turn there
But very much 6 a.m.​
Slightly been awake for twenty-four hours
So please forgive me
More ideas and stuff comin'
Yeah, yeah, fam, I'm wafflin'
But man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ

===== Drake - Chicago Freestyle =====
Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife

But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunnin' for the title
Lot of people tryna take us viral
I'm just tryin' to have a nice night though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, "Babe, I think there was a typo"
Nah, girl, I got it, that's light though
I could show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back
Let me give you images that last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show to the shower to the truck
Truck to the club for the party
You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watchin'

But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday, Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?

===== Eminem - Without Me =====
Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks
Ra—
Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Woo (Ooh, ooh)

Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
(Na-na-na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
(Na-na-na, na, na, na, na)

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie)

Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch"
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, "Attention, please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talkin', "This shit, that shit"
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

===== Eminem - Lose Yourself =====
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

You can do anything you set your mind to, man

===== Eminem - Till I Collapse =====
(Yo, left, yo, left) 'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
(Yo, left, right, left) Feel weak, and when you feel weak
(Yo, left, yo, left) You feel like you wanna just give up
(Yo, left, right, left) But you gotta search within you
(Yo, left, yo, left) Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
(Yo, left, right, left) And get that motivation to not give up
(Yo, left, yo, left) And not be a quitter
(Yo, left, right, left) No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse, I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop, you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, JAY-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney—Nate, hit me!

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out ('Til the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth (The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps ('Til my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse (Give out from underneath me)

Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me, I
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me

===== Eminem - The Real Slim Shady =====
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh)
It's the return of the "Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who", "Yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
"But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee"
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, "How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?"
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!"
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Ha-ha
I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up

===== Eminem - Mockingbird =====
Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh, Mama's only gone for the moment

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad (Haha)

===== Eminem - Love The Way You Lie =====
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — "Wait!
Where you going?" — "I'm leaving you!" — "No, you ain't!
Come back!" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

===== Eminem - Godzilla =====
Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha

===== Eminem - Stan =====
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There prob'ly was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you prob'ly hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, "no"
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, PS: We should be together too

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: You coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you, and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim, shut up, bitch! I'm tryna talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window (Window)
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car, they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was, it was you
Damn

===== Eminem - Rap God =====
"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings"
"But I'm only going to get this one chance" (Six minutes—, six minutes—)
"Something's wrong, I can feel it" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
"Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances"
"You are just what the doc ordered"

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?

===== Eminem - The Monster =====
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices
Inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Woo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—

I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices
Inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
Well, that's nothin'
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it
All could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes, I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders, no wonder
You're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
(New-hoo, ooh-hoo) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down
Yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices
Inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
Well, that's nothin'
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo
New-hoo, ooh-hoo

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and I'm comin' straight at
MCs, blood gets spilled then I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children, but if one kid
Out of a hundred million who are goin' through a
Struggle feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft turn nothin' into somethin'
Still can make that straw into gold, chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts:
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices
Inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed (Get along with)
Get along with the voices
Inside of my head (You're tryin' to)
You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath (And you think I'm)
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy

===== Eminem - Not Afraid =====
(I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid) Yeah
(To take a stand, to take a stand) It's been a ride
(Everybody, everybody) I guess I had to
(Come take my hand, come take my hand) Go to that place to get to this one
(We'll walk this road together, through the storm) Now some of you
(Whatever weather, cold or warm) Might still be in that place
(Just lettin' you know that you're not alone) If you're tryna get out
(Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road) Just follow me, I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game like a "Fuck you" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings, instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road (Same road, same road)

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me, you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I'd shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin', and

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road (Same road, same-)

===== Eminem - Superman =====
Mhmmm *inhales*
You high, baby?
Yeah, hahahaha
Yeah?
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too (Oh-ooh)
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh)
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday (Yeah-yeah)
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked—bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl

First thing you say:
"I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me"
Ooh, yeah, girl, run that game
"Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
'Rot In Pieces', uh, that's great"
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl

'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

===== Eminem - River =====
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)
River (Ooh), river run
Call me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)
River (Ooh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

===== Eminem - Venom =====
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—

Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the—

Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

===== Eminem - Lucky You =====
Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it, then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food (Yeah)
Pass the plate (Yeah), where my drink (Hol' up)?
This my day (Yeah, yeah), lucky you, fuck you too, woo

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo), give me some room (Hey), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo), give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished (Bap, bop, bop)
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin' (Yeah)
You might'a went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time (Yeah)
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My Twelve Days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch, I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón
Little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (Yeah, yeah)
Shit get relevant 'til all the beef die down (Yeah)
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down (Bop, bop)
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now (Woo! Woo!)
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab, down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom)

I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way (Yeah), I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em (Ah)
Wasn't in it for the trophies (Nah), just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"
I said, "I don't have any answers"
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (Yeah)
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, "What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap (Yeah)
Let's recap, way back, MCs that (What?)
Wreak havoc on tape decks (Woo)
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap (Nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (Yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks and I'm fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about an evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (Yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (Yeah)
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (Yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboys

So y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo), give me some room (Hey), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe (Joyner), hop out the coupe (Joyner), hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo), give me the juice

===== Eminem - Houdini =====
Hey, Em, it's Paul
Uh, I was listening to the album
Good fucking luck, you're on your own

Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
(Da-da-da, da, da, da, da, da, da)
(Da-da-da, da, da, da, da)

Well, look what the stork brung
(What?) Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb
(Bleah) With a forehead that it grew horns from
Still a white jerk
Pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher with the vic's, percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician, an electrician y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me
If I was to ever take a leave, It would be aspirin to break a feve
If I was to ask for Megan Thee Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat? (Ha!)
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back, like

Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh

Now back in the days of old me
(When) Right around the time I became a dope fiend
Ate some codeine, as a way of coping taste of opiates, case of O.E
​Turned me into smiley face emoji
My shit may not be age appropri—
Ate but I will hit an eight year old in the face with a participation trophy
'Cause I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout to turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out
To shut me down so when I started this verse
It did start off light-hearted at first
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed, look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all have been light joggin' and I've been running at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin, and I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best but ops I'm white-chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
"Oh my god, it's him... not again!"

Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh

Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say
(If what?) If he could see the way shit is today
(Look at this shit, man) He'd probably say that everything is gay
(Like happy!) What's my name, what's my name?

So, how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be
And that's why these words sting, just like you were being attacked by bees
In the coupe leaning back my seat
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group, the black guy pee's
In my Air Max 90's
White T's walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese
Identifies as black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' hacky sack I treat the whole world, 'cause I got it at my feet
How can I explain to you?
That even myself, I'm a danger too
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me what? Okay, that's it, go ahead, Paul, quit
Snake-ass prick, you male crossdresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that
(Watch) But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you, fuck my own kids they're brats (Fuck 'em)
They can screw-off, them and you all
You too, Paul, got two balls, big as RuPaul's, what you thought you saw ain't what you saw
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini, I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving, like

Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh

===== Eminem - Shake That =====
Woo! Shady, Aftermath
Look at that bitch
Oh, shit, hey (Damn)

There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk
Get fucked up, hit the strip club
Don't forget ones, get your dick rubbed, get fucked
Get sucked, get wasted, shit-faceted
Pasted, plastered – puke, drink, throw up
Get a new drink, hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated 'til the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this bitch gyrated
Them hips and licked them lips, and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing some shit

Two to the one, from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed, you wouldn't believe
And I get mo' ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me:
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountaintop
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen 'em drop
If I ain't got a weapon, I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass, I'm gon' continue to rock
Get your ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy, just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin', baby? Step right up
Some girls, they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm lookin' fo' a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin' it up

(Now) Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, ah, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me

I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish, yeah
Me and Nate D-o-double-g
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna, finna have a

We 'bout to have a party (Turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head and shake your butt)
I'm lookin' fo' a girl I can fuck in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' butt
Some girls, they act retarded (Man, I told you–)
Some girls are 'bout it, 'bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no

(Now) Look at this lady all in front of me
Sexy as can be
Tonight, I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
Now, I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind

(Now) Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, ah, girl
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, come on, girl

There she go, shakin' that ass on the flo'
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole

And I ain't leavin' without you, bitch!
Comin' home with me!
And my boy, and his boy

Haha, Nate Dogg!

===== Eminem - When I'm gone =====
Yeah, it's my life (Hey, Hailie)
In my own words, I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy, look what I made!" "Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself"
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"
"Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more" "Daddy, you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say, 'This is the last time'
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
"Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "You got one more chance to do right, and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late"
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on, and I'm singin'

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and "Thank you all for comin' out"
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!"
"But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?"
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'"
"But, baby, wait!" "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you, you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real"
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die, Shady!", and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am? (Give you my t-)
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos (No videos)
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors (I invented)
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no

They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong (Yeah, comin')
Still comin' out strong (Yeah, comin')
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong (Yeah, comin')
Still comin' out strong (Still comin')
Still comin' out..

Pluto don't dance, but I make moves (Keep comin')
We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you (Keep comin')
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too (Keep comin')
Told me, "Boy I think the money startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
You must not know who I am
I pour champagne on the ground
I pour champagne on the ground
My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (He was sayin')
You turned your back, I should have never gave you chances (Gave you chances)
I call for loyalty, she didn't ever answer
I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family (La familia)
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies
(So familiar)
I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded
Be honest to me

They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong (Be honest to me)
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out...

Kindness, she lie
Still comin', lie
Boss, fuck around, boss
Kindness
Down, like a nigga, she lie
Kindness, she lie
Kindness, oh

===== Dr. Dre - Forgot About Dre =====
Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me, 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-Gs
And the group that said, "Motherfuck the police"
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all
If y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton (Compton)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

===== Dr. Dre - What's The Difference =====
What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?

Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes, the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up – but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc; and Eazy, I'm still wit' you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you, and that's just being real wit' you
You see, the truth is, everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then, I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' they non-violent, talkin' like they— (Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit, and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name out of your mouth, and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
Yo, I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate, play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (Yeah)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
I smash the critics like a overhand right from Riddick (Yeah)
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid—never come down!
Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold your breath 'til ain't none left
Yo, that's the difference!

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute! I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back (Right), just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it, dog—you ever need somebody offed: "Whose throat is it?"
Well, if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's mama
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people ("Hi!")
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off, honkin' the horn for her (*Beep-beep!*)
Raw dog, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus and hot water
That's for tryna talk like 'The Chronic' was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
And you better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, "I just don't give a fuck!" and see who means it

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

What's the difference between me and— {*gunshot*}

===== Dr. Dre - I Need A Doctor =====
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
I told the world, one day, I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me, and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy, or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader
You're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me
When everyone was tellin' you don't sign me
Everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now, maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack-ass backwards producers, I'm back, bastards
One more CD, and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream
"Dre, don't leave us like that, man," 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

===== Dr. Dre - Xxplosive =====
Xxplosive, West Coast shit
My nigga-ish ways attract girls that used to turn they back
Causing me to yank they arm and pose like I would do them harm
Now I'm saying, "Thank you" 'cause they tell me my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive
For my niggas drinking Cognac, smoking weed, always pack
More than one firearm, chrome rims, riding on
Chronic in your system, let me know my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive

West Coast shit, nigga
Overdosage, imperial pistols ferocious
Fuck a bitch – don't tease, bitch, striptease, bitch
Eat a bowl of these, bitch – gobble a dick
Hoes forgot to eat a dick and shut the fuck up (Fuck up, bitch)
Gobble and swallow a nut up, shut up and get my cash (Cash)
Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop your collar, pimp convention, hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush six-deuce Impala
Pimping hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggas pay for hoes (Hoes), just to lay with hoes (Hoes)
Relax one night and pay to stay with hoes (Hoes)
Captain Save-'Em-All-Day (Bitch) – well, save this dick
Bitch nigga, you more of a bitch than a bitch
You ain't into hittin' pussy or hittin' a switch
You into hitting bitches off with a grip, you punk bitch

All my real dogs still kick it with me
All my down hoes still trickin’ with me
All the true gangstas know
Nate ain't never love no hoe
All the hoodrats still shake it for me
All my true fans still checkin’ for me
All the real smokers know
Nate ain't passin’ nothin’ but dope
Indeed
Real trees
Chronic leaves
No seeds
When I met you last night, baby
Before I blew your mind (Blew, blew, blew your mind)
I thought we had a chance, lady
No more—now that I'm sober, you ain't that fine, mm-mm
Don't wanna treat you wrong
Don't wanna lead you on
Here, baby, hit the bong
While the West Coast rolls along
(While we) Still making gangsta hits
(You'll be) Still jocking gangsta dicks
Damn, girl, you think you're slick?
Somebody better get this bitch, this bitch...

I got these freaky hoes clapping their hands, stomping their feet
Every now and then, they put they mouth on me
Nowadays, a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year-old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player–nowadays, it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said, "Don't let nobody know"
A bona fide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your '64, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowin' the ho for four days, pimpery pays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mo'
They be beeping me and shit, but we don't kick it no more
Them hot hoes is fiending, they on the nuts
But bitch, I'm out your pussy when I nut, for real

Xxplosive!

===== Dr. Dre - Keep Their Heads Ringin' =====
Yeah, what up, this is Dr. Dre
The party's goin' on
Thank God it's Friday

(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)

Keep their heads ringin'
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding (uh, yeah) dong)
Hey you! Sittin over there
Say what?
(You better get up out of your chair)
That's right
(And work your body down)
Yeah
(No time to funk around, 'cause we gon')
Funk you right on up
So get up, get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me "Blacula"
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keepin' it real enables me to make another mill,
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E ah keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

(Ring ding dong (uh)
Ring-a-ding ding (yeah) ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)

1, 2 for the crew, 3, 4 for the dough
5 for the hoes (hoes!) 6, 7, 8 for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect, plus a check
Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to 'cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you God damn right I'ma gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E ah keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

(Ring ding dong (yeahhh)
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'

Ring-a-ding ding ding (ha ha) dong)
Yeah, c'mon

If you want to get on down (uh, yeahhh)
You gotta get on down (c'mon, ha ha)
Just get on down (it's like that)

Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sending all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the backdrop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought 'em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you so, just call me Mop and Glo
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6'1", two, twenty-five of pure chocolate
Your chances of jacking me are slim, G
'Cause I rock from summer 'till Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
'Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro, So
Check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E ah keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

(Ring ding dong (yeahhhh)
Ring-a-ding (uh) ding ding dong)
I keep their motherfuckin' heads ringin'
(Ring ding dong (yea, uh)

If you want to get on down (yeah Death Row back up in that ass. For the one nine nine to the nickle)
You gotta get on down (so all you motherfuckers out there tryna get with this)
Just get on down, ho ohhhh (don't even try it, couldn't see us with binoculars)
If you want to get on down (no diggity, ha ha)
You gotta get on down (yeah, uh, I know you're bobbin' your head)

I know you're bobbin' your head
'Cause I could see ya

Yeah
Death Row, let me know you in the house (Beyotch!)
Ha ha
Yeah, that's right, we out

===== Dr. Dre - The Watcher =====
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Times is changin', young niggas is agin'
Becoming OG's in the game and changin'
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rappin'
When niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags, when it happens – that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched them go
Watched them rise, witnessed it, and watched them blow
Watched them all blossom, and watched them grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money? I lost them both
Went and visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show (The Watcher)

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The Watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The Watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I'm watchin')

I moved out of the hood for good – you blame me?
Niggas aim, mainly, at niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight now, I'm out of their dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug – how much 2Pac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch, neither
It's either my life or your, life and I ain't leavin' – I like breathin'
'Cause, nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip – shit, four pound for pound
Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
Just remember that you fuckin' with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you
Remember that when you wanna come and fill these shoes (The Watcher)

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The Watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (TheWatcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The Watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I'm watchin')

Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead, or enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we raised in
Then, they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around, stressed out and pull out gauges
'Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now, we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us
Lookin' at us now, callin' us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
It's funny how time flies
I'm just having fun, just watchin' it fly by (The Watcher)

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The Watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The Watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The Watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I'm watchin')

I'm watching

===== Dr. Dre - Fuck You =====
Hi, baby
I know you're under a lot of pressure at your work and all
And I do understand
You have no idea how much I understand
But you also don't have any idea how much I love you
I love you so much
I think about you, I feel you in my arms
I miss you, I miss you terribly
I've just always wanted someone like you in my life
I love you so much that I'd do anything, I'd do anything
I'll be your perfect woman for you
I just wanna fuck bad bitches
For all them nights I never had bitches
Now I'm all up in that ass, bitches
Mad at your boyfriend, ain't 'cha?
You's a bad girl, gotta spank ya
And gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit, hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate
Before you kiss 'em, use Colgate
She swallowed it, yeah, the bitch took the whole eight
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hittman hit it – damn, bitches
Man, this is what I'm talkin' 'bout
Chickenhead, chicken fed, with a dick in your mouth
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place
(AirTouch me) Next time you need a taste

I just wanna fuck you
No touchin' and rubbin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you
We can't be kissin' and huggin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time

You got the number, it's on you to make the call
You know I come quick, help you redecorate your walls
Cut your backyard, don’t have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm going too far, I take it out and wipe it off
And put it back up, and keep goin’
You tryin' to hide it from your husband, but I know he be knowin'
That your pussy's been tampered with
Did you show him that new trick
Of how you can make it smoke a cancer stick?
You be workin' it like a dancer, bitch – it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my mornin’ diggin' through some records instead
But tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases
Hook up somewhere and exchange some Fuck Faces
I know your man's lookin’ for ya, he's always tryna run ya
Don't worry 'bout me handcuffin', girl, 'cause I just wanna–

Fuck with you on the sneak tip, on some creep shit
So what you gon' do, you freak bitch?
You actin’ like you don't do dicks
That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin' with
Baby was a virgin, that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor, so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' ½ Dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowin' up my pager, the shit's gettin' major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Somethin' to go by and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth and then I'm out (See ya)
24/7, Dre, Snoop, and Devin
We servin' these hoes and never lovin' these hoes (Biatch)

I just wanna fuck you
No touchin' and rubbin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you
We can't be kissin' and huggin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time

C'mon (Yo, we gotta kill ‘em with this one!)
Alright (Check, check, check, check, check)
Get 'em!
Cut 'em undercover, timeless
Ready for 'em, progress
Feelin' like I'm just gettin' started
Two shots back for my dearly departed
Uh, you are now dеalin' with a monster
Boss shit, profits
Doc Dre, bitch, I'm a prophet
Black Wall Street, niggas know whеre the stock is
Heh, try me
Niggas never see me, but it ain't hard to find me
Heh, unwinding
Shit's blinding, still grinding, uprising (Agh)
Stop talking 'bout the past, I'm the future, nigga (Agh)
Nigga like me still here, motherfucker, go figure
Lookin' for my next gold digger
This summer here gon' be colder than winter
Already told you, I fold you like hundreds of billions
And you can go missing, put that on my children
Bet that, nigga, what?
Regret that, run it up
Heh, and I'm about to sum it up
This shit here that problem
Livin' at the bottom of a bottle
"Full throttle" my motto, eh
Fuckin' with me like fuckin' with the lotto
That awful in your nostril
In a brothel, this is gospel
Yeah, I'ma need all that, pronto

Yes, I, yes, I, yes, I ride 'til I die
Give a fuck if you bitches die
Put a motherfucking hole in your face
Back up, bitch, don't even try
I am that motherfucker, been the coldest
Why you on that? No one know us
Overdosed on what dope is (Yeah)
Hip-hop shit sell better than the coke did

Like a satanic cult, it's
An old ritual slaughtering GOATs, bitch (GOATs, bitch, yeah)
You're fucking with the original, flow's sick
And anybody can get it—COVID (Fuck with that?)
I done wrote shit that was so sharp
I could slit my own fucking throat with it
So rich, I got more chips than my shoulders
And I'm about as approachable as a roach is (Roach is)
Yeah, so better steer clear from him
And here comes a nuclear bomb for your eardrums
Lyricism at its most fearsome and fierce
We're on another tier like a tear duct's upper echelon (Yeah)
Your career sucked (Meaning what?), it was sheer luck (Like what?)
Like a fuckin' leprechaun with his beard cut
(You're the) Punisher, weapon drawn with a beer gut (Haha)
You're slower than a Decepticon with its gear stuck
(And I what?) I serial kill, and you're Kellogg's (What?)
I love checks and I hate tricks
And you're a fake bitch (Bitch)
I could spot you like you 'bout to weight lift (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm badder than cake mix
(But I) Can't be whipped with egg beaters (Nah)
You cunts must be out of your labias
And God's my alias, so if I don't have faith in me
Then it basically makes me an atheist (Woo!)
Nate Diaz got the world by the tracheas
In a chokehold and a sleeper (*Snores*)
Yeah, and me and Dre are like dog hair (Woof)
We're both in our lab coats like retrievers (Grrr)
But like a Doberman, I'm a whole different breed of (What?)
Animal mutt mixed with a overachiever (Yeah)
Oh, you're the king of rap? You're 'bout to be overthrown
Like a pass over the head of an open receiver
This shit could end up comin' to blows like a wiener (Haha)
But I ain't finished puttin' these hoes through the wringer (Nah)
Like clothes in between the two rollers, and– wait, no
What I mean is flows interwoven, I treat 'em like thread (Why?)
That's how I wound up sewin' Machine up
So, fucks, if you don't give up me the
Time to ride or die, 'cause you're either both or you're neither (Yeah, yeah)
Throw a middle finger up if you're rollin', but, me, I'm gonna— (Yeah, yeah)

Ride 'til I die
Give a fuck if you bitches die
Put a motherfucking hole in your face
Back up, bitch, don't even try
I am that motherfucker, been the coldest
Why you on that? No one know us
Overdosed on what dope is
Hip-hop shit sell better than the coke did

===== Dr. Dre - Fuck Wit Dre Day =====
Hah, yeah
Hell yeah
Hah, know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah

Mister Busta, where the fuck you at?
Can't scrap a lick, so I know you got your gat
Your dick on hard from fuckin' your road dogs
The hoods you threw up with, niggas you grew up with
Don't even respect your ass
That's why it's time for the doctor to check your ass, nigga
Used to be my homie, used to be my ace
Now I wanna slap the taste out your mouth
Make you bow down to the Row
Fuckin' me, now I'm fuckin' you, lil' ho
Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide
Let me ride, just another homicide
Yeah, it's me so I'ma talk on
Stompin' on the easiest streets that you can walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs
And watch your back 'cause you might get smoked, loc
And pass the bud and stay low-key
B.G., 'cause you lost all your homie's love
Now call it what you want to
You fucked with me, now it's a must that I fuck with you

You better raise up
Yeah, that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about
We have your motherfuckin' record company surrounded
Put down the candy and let the little boy go
You know what I'm sayin'? Punk motherfucker (We want Eazy)
(We want Eazy, we want Eazy)

Bow-wow-wow, yippy-yo, yippy-yay
Doggy Dogg's in the motherfuckin' house
Bow-wow-wow, yippy-yo, yippy-yay
Death Row's in the motherfuckin' house
Bow-wow-wow, yippy-yo, yippy-yay
The sounds of a dog brings me to another day
Play with my bone, would you, Timmy?
It seems like you're good for makin' jokes about your jimmy
Well, here's a jimmy joke about your mama that you might not like
I heard she was a 'Frisco dyke
But fuck your mama, I'm talkin' about you and me
Toe to toe, Tim M-U-T
Your bark was loud but your bite wasn't vicious
And them rhymes you were kickin' were quite bootylicious
You get with Doggy Dogg? "Oh, is he crazy?"
With your mama and your daddy hollerin', "Baby"
So won't they let you know
That if you fuck with Dre, nigga, you're fuckin' wit Death Row
And I ain't even swangin' them thangs
I'm hollerin' 187 with my dick in your mouth, biatch

Yeah, nigga, Compton and Long Beach together on this motherfucker
So you wanna pop that shit, get your motherfuckin' cranium cracked, nigga, step on up
Now, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke, so remember the name
Mighty, mighty D-R
Yeah, motherfucker (The shit done hit the fan)

Now understand this, my nigga Dre can't be touched
Luke's bending over so Luke's gettin' fucked, buster
Must've thought I was sleazy
Or thought I was a mark 'cause I used to hang with Eazy
Animosity made you speak what you spoke (Yeah)
Ayo, Dre (What up?), chip this nigga off, loc
If it ain't another ho that I gots to fuck with
Gap teeth in your mouth, so my dick's gots to fit
With my nuts on your tonsils
While you're on stage rappin' at your wack-ass concert
And I'ma snatch your ass from the backside
And show you how Death Row pull off that who-ride
Now you might not understand me
'Cause I'ma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
Then we gon' creep to South Central
On a street knowledge mission as I steps in the temple
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat
You tryna check my homie, you best check yourself
'Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself, motherfucker (Yeah, nigga)

So I don't want no dilapidated, two-faced, pigeon-toed, bow-legged, cross-eyed son of a gun fuckin' with me
Yeah, nine-deuce
Dr. Dre droppin' chronic once again
It don't stop
Punishin' punk motherfuckers real quick-like
Compton style, nigga
Doggy Dogg's in the motherfuckin' house
Yeah, Long Beach is in the motherfuckin' house
Yeah, yeah, straight up (Death Row is in the house, yeah)
Really, though
Breaking all them suckas off something real proper-like
You know what I'm sayin'?
All them sucker-ass niggas can eat a fat dick
Yeah, Eazy-E, Eazy-E, Eazy-E can eat a big fat dick
Tim Dog can eat a big fat dick
Luke can eat a fat dick
Yeah

Everyday it's the same thing, L.A. ain't changed
Niggas still playa hating, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
'Cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
Niggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn their car around
Rolling the window down (Hey, can we talk it out?)
(Nah, get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck trying to job hunt
Niggas got AK's
Niggas is way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast, without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worse
It takes half the time to get your whole life reversed
Always trying to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode

(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)

Late nights is full of lead that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and never re-light
With you in the sight of youngsters with automatics
Busting on shit to lay everything down, even tourists to non-affiliates
These days, gunplay is official, with green lights on every block
Though the sign tells you to, it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got Rugers and M14's with enough ammo to leave
An armored truck Swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leave
Ain't no warm welcomings
My eyes have witnessed the endin' on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!!)

Now tell me, what the fuck is this, man?
Niggas doing brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand
In front of your building and chill without yielding
Twelve year old children that kill, blood spilling
Thugs be illing, unnecessary slugs filling the sky
Usually drilling the one that wasn't willing to die
Yes sir, in the Killing Field, I got my life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder
These niggas got the nerve to question me
'Bout the colors that I got on?
I see that red dot on your knot, 'bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong man to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on my hit list
Peep this –
I cock back, you bow down
Bust round, bloody the ground
Retaliation sounds like this:

Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is

===== Dr. Dre - The Message =====
This one is for my brother, Tyree – R.I.P
A message to God
Since you finishing 'em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow – later we'll regret 'til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, 'cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doing when you made us
So with all due respect, you coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, 'cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why
Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, something we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
He had talent too – I had plans on watching him blow
Don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go

Listen, listen, listen (Listen)
Listen, listen, listen (Better listen)
Listen, listen, listen
Listen

If you wan' know why (Why I live my life)
The way that I do ('Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me ('Cause I know my way around)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper

You's a soldier, you're probably packing heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
'Cause I'm still paging you "9-1-1" – straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face
To straight breaking down and showing all emotions
From anxious to believing real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizing I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'ma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you

Listen, listen, listen (Listen)
Listen, listen, listen (Better listen)
Listen, listen, listen
Listen

If you wan' know why (Why I live my life)
The way that I do (Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me (Don't worry, don't worry)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper

Listen
If you don't know why you better listen up right now
Listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen, children, listen
I'm tryin' to tell you somethin' good
Don't get caught up in the hood, yeah
If you don't know why
You gotta find out the reason why
Brother, brother

Ain't no telling what the side effects could be
All these fine bitches equal sex to me
Plus I got this bad bitch laying next to me
No doubt, sat back on the couch
Pants down, rubber on, set to turn that ass out
Laid the bitch out, then I put it in her mouth
Pulled out, nutted on a towel, and passed out

Come on, let's get high (high)
Let's get high (high)

While I'm kicking my game and collecting them checks
Got all y'all niggas vexed to fuck this triple-X rated ho
You say you ain't eat it, you ate it though
And uh, Roq don't stop, can't be dropping no drawers
To the niggas, how you figure got you shitting in yours
Yeah, little dicks always running they mouth
While a bitch is better off to masturbate and be out
All you bitches up in here know what I'm talkin about
Get the loot, get the ice, fuck the wife, no doubt
Trying to live lavy, marry a big dick and stay cavi
Holla back at them niggas that hollered at me

===== Dr. Dre - Let Me Ride =====
Biatch
Eeeh, wha'ppen nuh, baby?
You look good inna ya car, eeh
Longtime mi watch ya and mi wah chat to ya
And ya a gwaan like ya nuh wah chat to me
So wha'ppen Dre, tell 'em weh di fuck a gwaan nuh
Creepin' down the back street on D's
I got my Glock cocked 'cause niggas want these
No soon as I said it, seems I got sweated
By some nigga with a TEC-9 tryin' to take mine
You wanna make noise? Make noise
I make a phone call, my niggas comin' like the Gotti boys
Bodies bein' found on Greenleaf
With their fuckin' heads cut off, motherfucker, I'm Dre
So listen to the play-by-play, day-by-day
Rollin' in my four with sixteen switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Clockin' all the riches, got the hollow points for the snitches
So won't you just walk on by? 'Cause I'm too hard to lift
And no, this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfuckin' D-R-E from the CPT
On a rhymin' spree, a straight G
Hop back, as I pop my top, you trip
I let the hollow points commence to pop, pop, pop
Yeah, 'cause if it don't stop
I'll have to put my shit in reverse, go back and take another spot 'cause I'm

Rollin' in my six-four
What all the niggas sayin'?
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (What all the niggas sayin'?)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride

Just another motherfuckin' day for Dre, so I'll begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks or black fists
It's just that gangster glare with gangster raps
That gangster shit makes a gangs of snaps, uh
Word to the motherfuckin' streets
And word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit you with, that I get you with
As I groove in my four on D's, hittin' the switches
Bitches, relax, while I get my proper swerve on
Bumpin' like a motherfucker, ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic, the Rémy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smellin' like Indonesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick 'cause my four on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit
So when I crawl, I comes correct
Now if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip and make a trip to the south side, yeah

Rollin' in my six-four
What all the bitches sayin'?
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (What all the motherfuckin' bitches sayin'?)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Know what I'm sayin'?)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride

Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slauson
On my way to the strip, now I'm just flossin'
Checkin' my rearview 'cause niggas, they will do
Jack moves, black fools 'cause I smack fools
Tryin' to set me up for a two-eleven
Fuck around and get caught up in a one-eight-seven
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynchin', but I just watch 'em hang
So on and so on, why don't you let me roll on?
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak
Now everybody peepin' out they window when they hear me beatin' up the street
Is it Dre? Is it Dre?
That's what they say every single motherfuckin' day
Yo, but I ain't trippin', I'm just kickin' it
While my D's keep spinnin' and these hoes keep grinnin', I'll be

Rollin' in my six-four
What everybody sayin'?

Swing down (Swing down), sweet chariot, stop (I wanna ride) and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Swing down (Swing down), sweet chariot, stop (I wanna ride) and let me ride (What everybody sayin'?)
Swing down (Swing down), sweet chariot, stop (I wanna ride) and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Swing down (Swing down), sweet chariot, stop (I wanna ride) and let me ride
Swing down (Swing down), sweet chariot, stop (I wanna ride) and let me ride

I got mo' class than most of 'em, ran with the best of 'em
Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of 'em
What can I say? Cali-for-ni-a
Where niggas die every day over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll with my shit off safety, for niggas that been hatin' me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin' gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
'Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to DPG
Started from that S.O.B., D-R-E
Like Dub-C, I'm rich rollin', pistol holdin'
Pockets swole, nigga, that's how I'm rollin'
Put the flame to the killer, nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure in the building, for real
I'm hittin' switches, makin' bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick every time I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watchin' the Lakers
I'm cool with éses who got AK's in cases

Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Niggas play this in their Rovers, Jeeps, and Regals
Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Bitches play this in their Benzes, Jeeps, and Geos

I'll bust a Mr. Toughy, slash a Smoovy Doovy
Crashin' Flex on Tuesdays, harassin' hoes at movies
Passin' by with Uzis, like who you aiming at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claimin' that
Rat-a-tat-tat
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You gotta recognize Hittman is an enterprise
Cali pride, Bronson rider, South Central-ised
The Henny got me energized, smoke the guys
Tryna focus on mines, poke they eyes out, I'm L.A.'s loc'est
Hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggas in the pen that get hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin' hard – Hittman and Dre
You playin' games? I suggest you know the rules
We puttin' guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo' honey and cruise to the Snooty and snooze
Cop booze, pop coochie 'til the nut oozes
You shouldn't fuck with crews this sick
The Aftermath is we rule shit
I'm Big Hitt, don't confuse me with no other
'Bout to blow, motherfucker

Dedicated to all of those with big egos

With feet like Ben Vereen's, bitch, don't call here anymore
No no, no no

Some good-ass weed

Man, I don't give a fuck about what that nigga said, man
That's what's wrong with you niggas

If you ain't ready for the game (Uh-uh) – nigga, stop that shit
We rock that shit, my nigga Dre, drop that shit (Right)
No mo' talkn', I'm walkin' and I'm poppin' the clip
Glock on the hip, set-trippin', dippin' and shit

Bitch niggas, bitch niggas (Bitch niggas)
These niggas don't know what the fuck is goin' on
Yo, Dogg – check it, kick back
Let me holler at these niggas for a minute

Straight off the streets of chaos and no pity
The aggravated, makin' these punk motherfuckers hate it
(Compton) is the city I'm from
Can't never leave the crib without a murder wea-pon
Huh, I can't live my life on broke no mo'
And most of these fools ain't shit but cutthroats
They smile in a nigga face, and for what?
They got the game fucked up, and want my thing fucked up
I done learned a lot, seen a whole lot
The top notch nigga, I'm fiendin' for that spot
Now peep game on what Six-Deuce told me...

These niggas after yo' paper, Dr. D-R-E (Wha?)
And these punk-ass hoes is lookin' for dough
You gotta watch your homeboys, 'cause a nigga never know
Oh, they'll be around, but when yo' paper get low
Just like Master P said, "There they go, there they go"
Bitch niggas, uh-huh

Attention all personnel:
Stop schemin', and lookin' hard

Hmm, you'd rather blow me than fight, I'm from the old school
Like Romey Rome, homey, yo, you owe me the right
To slap you, like the bitch that you are, been wantin' to cap you
Every since you was mad doggin' me with that bitch in yo' car
Fool, "Who do you think you are? Mr. Big Stuff"
Man, you shit on Hitt, get yo' shit bust, plus
Pistol-whipped, cover it up, use yo' bitch's blush

You don't want no trouble with the Aftermath staff, trust me

===== Dr. Dre - Murder Ink =====
When darkness be closin' in
I motivate, with the howlin' wind, With a list of chosen men
Frozen in sin, knowin' that your end is beginnin'
Swift silent and deadly
There's no defending my plots
I know your every movement – for six months I watch
Could've got you at your baby's mother's house, even at your down-low weed spot
But the backdrop, wasn't flattering enough
I didn't want people gathering and stuff
Snapshots of blood splattering from the snuff
Here – puff this cig, while I figure which way to split your wig
Right now you as nervous, as a Farmer John pig
As I dig into my tragic bag, take out the HK
Twist on the silencer, insert the 30 shot mag
Bullet stuck to his brain like a magnet
Skull in fragments, I leave the cleanup to Dragnet

This is anybody (Murderer)
To fuckin' everybody (Murderer)
Nigga, all y'all (Murderer)
Uh, uh, for real, you'll fuck around and get killed
This is anybody (Murderer)
Motherfuckin' everybody (Murderer)
Yeah nigga, all y'all (Murderer)
Uh, uh, for real, you'll fuck around and get killed

Peeped all the stash drop and exchange of the dough
Lurkin' through the turf, thinkin' how much it's worth
Give 'em chase to the crib and yo, he properly laced
Stepped out the car, put my steel to the side of his face
Murder is the fuckin' Case, rob this nigga and shake
The fuckin' spot, 'cause in a few it's gon' be crawlin with cops!
Who's the bad bitch now? You crept on, paid the piper
Who'd've thought a sexy bitch could be a murderous sniper
Detrimental to your health, should've learned your lesson
But it's too late nigga bye-bye, better count your blessings
I been watchin' you watchin' me, yeah you ballin'
Was, nigga now you finger fucked and steady fallin'
A thug wit no love, but bitch niggas die fast
Thug niggas die young – oh, what? You thought you would last?
Blast two shots to the dome, slide back to the pad
And jack my nigga off 'til his dick get soft
Resume the wifey boo shit, 'cause yo, my man don't know
That his bitch is straight ill, serving ass with po'-po'

I'm a motherfuckin' (Murderer)
Bitch, this is anybody (Murderer)
Yeah, nigga, all y'all (Murderer)
Uh, uh, for real, you'll fuck around and get killed
I'm a motherfuckin' (Murderer)
Uhh – bitch, this is anybody (Murderer)
Yeah, nigga all y'all (Murderer)
Uh, uh, for real, you'll fuck around and get killed!

===== Iggy Azalea - Work =====
Walk a mile in these Louboutins
But they don't wear these shits where I'm from
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you
I'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through

Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes
Three jobs, took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say
But don't know shit about where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub
Just to make it past where I am from

No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
16 in the middle of Miami

I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit

You can hate it or love it
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting
Thoroughbred in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that Pac shit
My passion was ironic
And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind, basically raped me
Rose through the bullshit like a matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at 'em
And even the score
So, I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At four in the morning
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant, art ignorant
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate to be inconsiderate
But the industry took my innocence
Too late, now I'm in this bitch!
You don't know the half
This shit get real
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins
What you call that?
Head over heels

No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
No money, no family
16 in the middle of Miami
16 in the middle of Miami

I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I've been work-work-work-work-workin' on my shit
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit

Pledge allegiance to the struggle
Ain't been easy
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffle
Bags is all we had
Do anything for my Mama, I love you
One day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice
That ya managed to muscle
Sixteen, you sent me through customs so
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury
Turn first at the light that's in front me
'Cause every night I'ma do it like it's my last
This dream is all that I need
'Cause it's all that I ever had

Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit

You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothin' to something, liking to lovin'
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feelin' stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothin' for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believin' what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singin' this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So, baby, now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya

Black, black widow, baby

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doin' whatever works
You ain't ever met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it, 'til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gaspin' for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind and it's nothin' but me
On it (On it, on it), now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Til I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want (Shh)

You used to be thirsty for me (Right)
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So, baby, now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy (Oh)

Gotta twist this beat, I'ma sprain my joint
Straight crack rock, ball 'til I pop, pop
Pull my trigger, Rap City, no Tigga
Yeah, shorty do it illa', I'm raw, no Digga'

Don't compare me to her, throw the bitch in the ditch
Ruff ruff ho, kill the bitch, I'm Vick

With my strap on, my vibrator
'Bout to bust a rhyme, no violator
Chordz know, I feel myself, I'm a masterbater
Like: "Uh, uh, uh, uh, fuck me! Fuck me!"
Now I'm offbeat, my head hurts

Wash my mouth, I curse like a sailor, bitch

Look, I'm pretty, I'm petty, I pop like confetti
'Cause shit can get deadly, so don't make me jelly
I been on my worse, I let bridges burn
You hoes never learn, you scared, go to church
Don't open your mouth, I'm a jawbreaker
Been in car chases, I'm a lawbreaker

Ain't sober, don't get me started
Got a motor, my motive is bipolar, thought I told ya

===== Iggy Azalea - Savior =====
Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
Things gettin' crazy, losin' my patience
Why you keep me waitin'? Goin' through the phases
Got me walkin' out the house all done up
Just in case I see your face and you decide to run up
Yeah, I'm in a different place, I need someone to hold on to
I been sendin' up a prayer hope the call gets through

'Cause my heart beats for you only
I wonder if you even know me
Countin' down every moment
That I wait for ya, I wait for ya
I wonder if you even notice
Lately I've been feelin' hopeless
Easy to lose focus
But I'll wait for ya

I've been looking for a savior (Hey)

Ah-ay, na-na-na-aye (I've been looking for a savior)
Ah-ay, na-na-na-aye (Savior, yeah, to save me)

I feel like God playin' tricks on me, got a fix on me
Feel the weight of the world like I got a brick on me
Had a dance with the devil and he got a grip on me
I'm just tryna get to heaven, hope you got a ticket for me, huh
I've been sending up prayers, I need feedback
Past full of sin, can someone delete that?
My path got muddy, I feel like my feet trapped
Can you give me the strength now to beat that?

'Cause my heart beats for you only
I wonder if you even know me
Countin' down every moment
That I wait for ya, I wait for ya
I wonder if you even notice
Lately I've been feelin' hopeless
Easy to lose focus
But I'll wait for ya

Make it bounce

I don't wanna hurt ya, but I'm about to work ya
Watch your mouth, drop real low
I'm turning you up, I'm burning the clutch
Full speed, both feet to the floor, feet to the floor
DJ running that back once more, time to party, that's all I know
Grab somebody, tell 'em, "Baby, baby, baby let's go"

Bounce, make it, make it bounce

Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce

Shake it, break it, make it bounce

Tippin' em broads, hundreds and fifties
Pullin' up, NASCAR, black car
Shittin' on everyone, sippin' whatever we feelin'
Real real good, hands to the ceiling
Dance 'til we dizzy, we spinnin', we spendin'
All about money, the night's never ending
We party 'til morning, tomorrow, we kick it

Bounce, make it, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce
Shake it, break it, make it bounce
Bounce, make it bounce

Dip it, spin it, and watchin' my hips

Crazy, move your body like Swayze
Round and round, shake it, break it, make it bounce
It's a fucking celebration, go, go, go
Girl shake ya thang like you made it, get low, low, low
Then show the good like you're wasted, po', po', po'
And spray the crowd with amazement, fo' the sho, sho, sho

First things first, I'm the realest (Realest)

I can hold you down, like I'm givin' lessons in physics (Right, right)
You should want a bad bitch like this (Huh?)
Drop it low and pick it up just like this (Yeah)
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, somethin' worth a half a ticket on my wrist (On my wrist)
Takin' all the liquor straight, never chase that (Never)
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back (What?)

Swagger on stupid, I can't shop at no department
And get my money on time, if it ain't bout money, decline
And I swear I meant that there so much that I'll give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if it ain't bout money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who dat, who dat? That do that, do that?

===== Iggy Azalea - New Bitch =====
He got a house that's too big, sits on a hill in the valley
Said he trying to move on with life, but he still wanna be a good daddy
So I sit in the ride 'cause I don't want us overlapping
Spendin' money on Mac, that's cute, I get checks from them in Paris
Better check my tax bracket, what you think was gon' happen?
Naggin', now he's had it and y'all fell off like Mad Men
These exes excessively hatin' on the next bitch
She's no housewife, just desperate
I know it's hard to let go, but accept it

‘Cause the whole world is watchin'
And the paparazzi is flockin'
‘Cause we fly shit when we drop in
And we shut down your party
"His and her" gold chains
Gold watches, everything
His old girl, she gon' hate
And they gon' have something to say

When I hop out his new six, fresh in some new shit
"Damn, she is too thick, who is this?"
Yeah, I'm his new bitch, yep, I'm his new bitch, yep
And I'm spending his new cash, few trips, new bags
Damn, she is too bad, oh you mad?
That I'm his new bitch, yeah
I'm his new bitch, yeah

She be the one that be like
"Hey, girl, what's up? You in town?"
Yes, I'm in town, kissing ---- on the face, and you know this
So just say it

It's always jealous broads wishing they was in my shoes
But I'm a debut, you a deja vu
Girl, you know the drill, I got a couple loose screws
Driving, riding, all black suits
Up north in a coupe before I meet him with the crew
And what I do, it can't be compared
You well done and, bitch, I'm rare
So stop popping up unexpected
Stop sending threats and text messages
We too grown for this messy shit
This’ll be my last conversation
If you don't want no problems, move yourself from the equation

‘Cause the whole world is watchin'
And the paparazzi is flockin'
‘Cause we fly shit when we drop in
And we shut down your party
"His and her" gold chains
Gold watches, everything
His old girl, she gon' hate
And they gon' have something to say

When I hop out his new six, fresh in some new shit
"Damn, she is too thick, who is this?"
Yeah, I'm his new bitch, yep, I'm his new bitch, yep
And I'm spending his new cash, few trips, new bags
Damn, she is too bad, oh you mad?
That I'm his new bitch, yeah
I'm his new bitch, yeah

Tell your friends to tell their friends, too
He got a new chick, but it ain't you (What?)
I'm just saying, you know it's true
Cry a river and swim on through
I know you hoping we won't make it
Clyde and Bonnie, let the world chase us
Ride or die where the world takes us
If we end up poor or rich and famous
I'm all he needs and more chick
His home chick, his tour chick
His 4th finger, left hand chick
And all those people go "Damn, chick"

When I hop out his new six, fresh in some new shit
"Damn, she is too thick, who is this?"
Yeah, I'm his new bitch, yep, I'm his new bitch, yep
And I'm spending his new cash, few trips, new bags
Damn, she is too bad, oh you mad?
That I'm his new bitch, yeah
I'm his new bitch, yeah

It's crazy, the mushy shit be making me hurl
Big baby, I know you want a taste of the pearl

===== Iggy Azalea - Walk the Line =====
Yeah we don't wanna do anything to scare your children
That's the last thing we wanna do
We don't wanna scare anybody

Never said it was fair, but still I never knew fear
Not in a million years could you tell me that I'd be here
I just hopped off that lear, my life on another tier
Lifting glasses for cheers, keep that hating out my ear
From country living to country skipping, this would drive you crazy
Check the rate that they pay me, a giant could never slay me
Money never a maybe, but never forgot my roots
I heard that the top is lonely, I wonder if it's the truth
So I'm just climbing, paid off rhyming, now I'm shining, could be blinding
Ain't too much real left, but right here is where you could find it
This that new classic, ain't this what you needed?
I'm what amazing look like, now recognize it when you see it

Not where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just tryna make it on my own
And unless destiny calls, I don't answer phones
This is the line and I walk alone
Ain't no going back now
Don't know where I'm at now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone

I've been counted out and been stepped on
I was wide awake and got slept on
I had everything and then lost it
Worked my ass off, I'm exhausted
All this talkin' 'bout me, just talk about me
I'm here now, they can't walk around me
I'm dedicated, flow elevated
Tell every hater, I hope you never play it
Said I'd never make it
Now I'm celebrating, and I'm never quitting, no resignation
Took desperate measures outta desperation
I'm the fresh face with no expiration
I know pressure make diamonds, so I threw 'em off in this chain
When it's all on the line, I'm who you want in the game
Cause I'm gon' get it, and that's fasho
Can't be like y'all that's a no-go
International while y'all local
Got this locked up just like po-po
Every beat get ate, that's ocho
Won't lose, oh no, that's Yoko
Been up and down like low-lows
Still make my own on my solo
Had to be here, to believe it
Think like winners to perceive it
Had to let 'cha know that I mean it
If I speak it, and say keep it
This flow, that's genius
Just think about it, what I think about it?
If I didn't live it, won't ink about it
Married to the money, put a ring around it, what?

Not where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just tryna make it on my own
And unless destiny calls, I don't answer phones
This is the line and I walk alone
Ain't no going back now
Don't know where I'm at now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone

And everything ain't the way I planned it
But when the smoke clears, I'm the last standing
This lifestyle can be so demanding
But I take off like a plane and ain't never landing

Not where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
Just tryna make it on my own
And unless destiny calls, I don't answer phones
This is the line and I walk alone
Ain't no going back now
Don't know where I'm at now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone

Ain't no going back now
Ain't no going back now
This is the line and I walk alone

===== J.Cole - No Role Modelz =====
First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, "Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in White neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
"I'ma need my shirt back" (Nigga, you know how it go)

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), yeah, ayy
(She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), haha
(She shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow, she shallow)

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

===== J.Cole - MIDDLE CHILD =====
You good, T-Minus?

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real

===== J.Cole - Wet Dreamz =====
Cole
Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin', I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, "You ever had sex before?" Damn…

And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

I wrote back and said
"Of course I had sex before," knowin' I was frontin'
I said, "I'm like a pro, baby," knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
"Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'."
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
"Yeah, baby, sound like a plan."
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck

And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

Yeah, you know that feelin' when you
Know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', "God, don't let me bust quick"
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top and then she
Get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
"I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—"
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

===== J.Cole - Work Out =====
I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then (Cole World)

Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)
Straight up, now tell me

===== J.Cole - Power Trip =====
Got me up all night
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song "Dreams" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, "Give me twenty dollars, dollars!"
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

Got me up all night (All night)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

Back when I was sleeping in my mama crib

I won't tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine
And I won't tell nobody

This is the part that the thugs skip!

Young nigga never had love, you know
Foot massage, back rub shit
Blowin' bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watched years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin' 'bout some kids, still I
Tell them hoes come through, the break-up
Get to know somebody and you really learn
A lot about 'em, won't be long 'fore you start to doubt 'em
Tell yourself you're better off without 'em
Then in time, you will find can't walk without 'em
Can't talk without 'em, can't breathe without 'em
Came here together, you can't leave without 'em
So you walk back in, make a scene about 'em
On your Amerie, it's just 1 Thing about 'em, it's called love
Niggas don't sing about it no more
Don't nobody sing about it no more
(No more), no more
It's called love
Niggas don't sing about it no more

===== J.Cole - Neighbors =====
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
'pologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' "You do you and I do me"
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well, motherfucker, I am

Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'

===== J.Cole - Love Yourz =====
Hm, love yours
Hm, love yours
No such thing

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive ('Live, 'live, 'live)
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived ('Rived, rived, rived)
Don't be sleepin' on your level
'Cause it's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Goes for all y'all (Nah, nah)
It's beauty in the struggle, nigga (Beauty, beauty)
Let me explain, yeah

It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words and listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
Compared to some my niggas down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairy tale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
'Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches, listen, this is what you'll find
The good news is, nigga, you came a long way
The bad news is, nigga, you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Ha)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Think being broke was better)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
(Think being broke was better, yeah) No such thing, no such thing
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love?
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I ask for strength from the Lord (Man) up above
'Cause I been strong so far, but I can feel my grip loosenin'
Quick, do somethin' before you lose it for good, get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of livin' with demons 'cause they always invitin' more
Think being broke was better, now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there livin' in debt
Cashin' minimal checks, turn on the TV, see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely, and as a nigga who was once in your shoes
Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga, feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy 'til you love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours (Love yours)
No such thing, no such thing
Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive ('Live, 'live, 'live)
Fake niggas mad, snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived ('Rived, rived, rived)

Oh, you can't hurry God
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, Lord
No matter how, no matter how long it takes, yeah
No matter how long it take, nigga
Oh, God, yeah
You can't hurry God

Spiralin' up, just like a rich nigga staircase (Staircase)
No fly zone, please stay the fuck out my airspace (Out my face)
Niggas say things behind backs that they wouldn't dare say (Dare say)
Know it's on sight when I see you, I'm workin' at Squarespace
Yeah, top of the mornin', I know that you thought I was dormant
Woke up early from shots that were swarmin'
A block full of opps, now the cops in an orbit
Guess somebody got popped, now they knockin' on doors
Tryna find an informant but I ain't see Nathan
I'm mindin' my business as God is my witness
No weapon gon' prosper that’s formin' against mе
Nigga, I'm starvin', immensely
Know when I'm donе with these songs, you gon' miss me
Ja Morant, I'm on my Grizzly
You niggas just cubs but no, not the ones in the big leagues
After The Fall Off, I promise I'm comin' to sellin' out Wrigley's
Nigga, I'm just a product of poverty, full of narcotics to profit off quickly
My family tree got a history of users that struggle with demons
Not really the hustler instincts
Therefore, often, my pockets was empty
So while some of my partners was servin' up rocks on the corners, the project assemblies
Me, I was startin' to envy, wanna be on the top where it's plenty
Wanna be in the spot like where every bitch want me like Rihanna droppin' new Fenty
What I see in the sky, the 'Ville is the ceilin', can't reach up too high, evidently
Nah, shit, I can't reach up too high, evidently
Never seen no one drivin' a Bentley
I can't be out here moppin' up Wendy's

My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it out the struggle, don't judge me
What you sayin' now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from (Come from), so often (So often)
People you grow up with layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life

Say what? The stuff that I've seen got me traumatized
I let the K go when Johnny died
Swangin' that muhfucka' side to side
We don't participate, ain't with that squashin' shit, all we believe in is homicide
I got a good heart, so I send teddy bears every time we make they mommas cry
I pray that my past ain't ahead of me (21)
When I'm in love, I love heavily (On God)
If you betray me, you dead to me (21)
I disrespect you respectfully (Straight up)
I got some partners who left this Earth
Maybe the pain made a better me (On God)
Just know that they secrets is kept with me (On God)
I feel like the streets is in debt with me (Straight up)
I gave my heart away to all the dawg hoes 'cause that's who accepted me (21)
I blame my pops for that shit 'cause if he didn't fail, he could've corrected me (21)
Give all the props to my momma 'cause no matter what, she always protected me (On God)
I promise you, it ain't no checkin' me (On God)
Jump in the water, get wet with me (Straight up, 21, 21)
You want my money or wanna have sex with me?
Can't let the opps or the law get the best of me
I get to answerin', you get to testin' me
I see chicken, you niggas is breast to me
Planted a seed but it ain't a sesame
Can't let you niggas or bitches grow next to me

My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it out the struggle, don't judge me
What you sayin' now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from (Come from), so often (So often)
People you grow up with layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life

===== J.Cole - Kevin’s Heart =====
She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror

She my number one I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies

Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

I love her, I don't want to lose her
I'm selfish, I know that I use her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My actions I know they confusin'
At home I look happy as usual
On the road I'm a mack, I'm a chooser
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that
Kevin's Heart

They tell me "What's done in the dark
Will find a way to shine"
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
What's done in the dark will always find a way to shine
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind

Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft-spoken
I came to talk to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you (Feeling you)
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

She fuck with small-town niggas, I got bigger dreams (Bigger dream), hm

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'til 2 o'clock
Put yo' motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gon' see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla 'cause you know they 'bout to cut the lights on

And put my number in it—
Huh, I'm staring at you from afar
I'm wondering 'bout you, like where you from and who you are
'Cause you a star, no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type that light the night time
I heard you got a man, but who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine, huh

Uh

L'orgoglio è il diavolo
Penso che abbia una presa su di me
L'orgoglio è il diavolo
Ha lasciato così tanti R.I.P
L'orgoglio è il diavolo
Penso che si sia impossessato di me
L'orgoglio è il diavolo, sì, uh

Terrorizzato, paranoico, ti metterò sopra ogni cosa per riempire il vuoto
E quando te ne sarai andato, avrò qualcosa o sarò distrutto? Uh
Terrorizzato, paranoico, ti metterò sopra ogni cosa per riempire il vuoto
E quando te ne sarai andato, avrò qualcosa o sarò distrutto? Sì

Le luci brillanti mi passano davanti in città, è un'emergenza
Sono grato perché ho superato i miei trent'anni, nessuno mi ha ucciso
Ricordo ancora vividamente il negro che mi ha puntato una pistola
Sono pietrificato, ma mi muovo come se non avessi alcun senso di urgеnza
L'orgoglio fa sì che un negro si comporti più duramentе di quanto non sia in realtà
L'orgoglio nasconde la vergogna quando la città ha tagliato tutti i servizi
L'orgoglio nasconde il dolore di crescere nella povertà
L'orgoglio fa sentire un negro nel modo in cui tu mi seguiresti
Fai in modo che un negro abbia mille dollari come se avesse vinto alla lotteria
Fai in modo che una baby mama renda la merda più difficile di quanto debba essere
Ti costringono a portare la puttana in tribunale per vedere il tuo prodigio
Farti usare la tua ultima risorsa e fare una rapina
L'orgoglio è la ragione della dicotomia familiare
Ho degli zii e delle zie che sono troppo orgogliosi per dare delle scuse
Lentamente realizzando quale sia la radice di tutti i miei problemi
Mi fa sentire diverso quando qualcuno dice di essere orgoglioso di me

L'orgoglio è il diavolo, uh
Penso che si sia impossessato di me
L'orgoglio è il diavolo, uh
Ha lasciato così tanti R.I.P
L'orgoglio è il diavolo
Penso che si sia impossessato di me
L'orgoglio è il diavolo, uh, sì

Terrorizzato, paranoico, ti metterò sopra ogni cosa per riempire il vuoto
E quando te ne sarai andato, avrò qualcosa o sarò distrutto? Uh
Terrorizzato, paranoico, ti metterò sopra ogni cosa per riempire il vuoto

Troppi soldi da contare, qual è l'importo?
L'assegno non rimbalza mai
Devo pagare un negro per sommarli
Poi pagare qualcuno che si assicuri che qualsiasi cifra dica, lui la possa sostenere
Ho rastrelliere su rastrelliere, mi sto accatastando, accatastando
You're reachin', I'm actin' up

Rompere, pesare, ora impacchettare
Fare cinque al mese, è regolare
Nigga che gioca con noi, questo è negativo
Tornare indietro per iniziare, questo non è mai
Sono un capo, il mio armadio di pelle
Non ci sono giorni di riposo nel mio programma
Finché vivo, vivremo per sempre
Ho detto al mio gemello che questa merda migliora
Questi negri sono scivolati, lascia che li porti avanti
Ho i piedi in alto, ho pagato band stupide per fare sesso sul jet
Non ho bisogno di loro, quella merda nel passato, mi sento come quello che c'è dopo
Ho la mia velocità, il piede tutto sul gas, questo non è un C8 'Vette
Posso batterli, credo in me, dimmi solo qual è la scommessa
Tutto il mio orgoglio è andato, ho dovuto perdere tutto e poi sono diventato ricco
Possiedo cinque case, sono contento che alcune di queste stronzate inizino ad avere senso
Sono concentrato e non posso dimenticare il quadro generale
Non posso nemmeno abbracciarti, non avevo un cazzo, non lo dimenticherò
Sarò distrutto?
Vieni da me con tutto, sta iniziando a diventare fastidioso
Sono dipendente dalla prometazina, è pazzesco, sì, lo so
Tutti questi soldi in arrivo, mi fanno impazzire non mostrarli
Sarò pazzo se li spreco

L'orgoglio è il diavolo, uh
Penso che abbia una presa su di me
L'orgoglio è il diavolo, uh
E ha lasciato così tanti R.I.P
L'orgoglio è il diavolo
Penso che si sia impossessato di me

I keep my faith strong, uh
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful, uh
I don't know why you call on me
This is my canvas (Yeah, my canvas)
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I (Paint it)
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you 'cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish? I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn, she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show, I love her just like I love you, and
I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together, uh

Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right, I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat 'em up and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you, nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's an AP, nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me, nigga— huh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes, so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, "Thanks for the view," waiting on thanks from a few
'Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard, but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like "boing!" on a big ass Boeing, and getting head like a coin toss, too easy

Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
They tell me I should fix my grill 'cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can't face what's wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim 'cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful, you can't be sure
'Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
'Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can't touch, that them broads can't be
And that's you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I'll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain't laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase 'em
Look at the nation
That's a crooked smile braces couldn't even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, 'cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let's make a mil'
Hey officer man, we don't want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain't snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn't need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round


La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

===== J.Cole - A Tale Of 2 Citiez =====
Uh
Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me, my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees, my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need, my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see, my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?
Last night I had a bad dream (Bad dream, bad dream)
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing? (Bad thing, bad thing)
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
(What's the value of a thing?) Guess not
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Small town nigga, Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me 'til you get it how could you know?
How could you know? (How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know?)
How could you know? (How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know? How could you know?)
Listen up, I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Fuck with me, my nigga
We gon' circle 'round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some trees, my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see, my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key, my nigga
Listen up, I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to, nigga
Me, I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too, nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do, nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let 'em kill your dream
It'll haunt you, nigga, haunt you

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things? (What's the value of a thing?)
Guess not
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is, nigga, run that shit right now)
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command

Bada-ba, da-da
Off-Season
Let's work, hey

Plottin' my escape, this game rotten, niggas fake
Got a couple M's hidin' in the safe
Imagination turned a Honda into Wraith
I was doin' eighty on the interstate
Tryna make it back before my class started
Country nigga never seen a passport
'Til I popped off and got a bag for it
Now I'm at the Garden sittin' half court
Watchin' Jr. catch it off the backboard
'Ville nigga never seen nothing
'Cept a fucking triple beam jumping
Good dope leave a fiend krumping
Made it out, it gotta mean something

Either you gon' hustle or that nigga Uncle Sam got yo' ass re-enlisting
2-6, murder scene pumping
Better leave it tucked if you ain't dumping
Pow, pow, nigga, he slumping
Twelve comin', we ain't seen nothing
Time change, niggas ain't rumbling no more
Nah, what for? Hungry for more
If you solo these vocals, listen close and you can hear grumbling
Multi' and I'm still munching
Big bag, never fear fumbling
Want smoke? Nigga don't choke
I'm a whole fuckin' nicotine company
Dreamville the Army, not a Navy
How could you ever try to play me?
Kill 'em on a song, walk up out the booth
Do the Westbrook rock-a-baby
I never fall out with the bro
Hate when your family turn into foe
We had a penthouse on the road
Interior decorated with the hoes
Just like a multiple-choice getting chose
My niggas like, "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe"
Scoop up a dime-piece like we homeless
Then we gon' send 'em back pigeon-toed
Out of the concrete was a rose, them winters was cold
Had to go over and stand by the stove
We from the Southeast, niggas know
This where the opps creep real slow
Won't vote but they mob deep with the poles
I punch the time sheet, not no more
'Cause now my assigned seat is the throne

Plottin' my escape, this game rotten, niggas fake
Got a couple M's hidin' in the safe
Imagination turned a Honda into Wraith
I was doin' eighty on the interstate
Tryna make it back before my class started
Country nigga never seen a passport
'Til I popped off and got a bag for it
Now I'm at the Garden sittin' half court
Watchin' Jr. catch it off the backboard
'Ville nigga never seen nothing
'Cept a fucking triple beam jumping

Made it out, it gotta mean something

===== J.Cole - Can't Get Enugh =====
Cole World
Southside
Can't get enough, can't get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out

Now, I ain't got no kids yet, but this right here's for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet, but that's how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter, pro'bly make a gay nigga reconsider
You're now rockin' with the best, mane, dress game down to the sex game
Won't brag, but the boy been blessed, mane, let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she's fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl, 'cause a nigga don't play them ex games
Nope, straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain't coming off of my last name, 'cause I really can't take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit, your homegirl saying, "He a bad boy"
But I'm signed to the Roc, no time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids

She said
"I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got I need a lot, so I can't let you go"

She said, "I can't get enough, can't get enough" (I need that)
"I can't get enough, can't get enough" (I need that)
"I can't get enough of what you got, good God, you hit the spot
Try to let go, but I just cannot, so don't you stop, I need that"

Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter, even way out in London town
Hoes holla, 'cause they love my sound and I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that'll cut all night, that'll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight, tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight, on the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head, I hate it when you give me headaches

She said
"I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got I need a lot, so I can't let you go"

She said, "I can't get enough, can't get enough" (I need that)
"I can't get enough, can't get enough" (I need that)
"I can't get enough of what you got, good God, you hit the spot
Try to let go, but I just cannot, so don't you stop, I need that"

Hey, Cole World, baby, ain't nothin' sunny, I see 'em hating, but it ain't nuttin' to me
I'm from the Ville where they bang for the money and carry fo'-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred? Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let's make a track, I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr
That's the hook right thurr, that's the hook right thurr
Never mind that, girl, let's make a track, I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr

She said
"I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got I need a lot, so I can't let you go"

===== J.Cole - Immortal =====
Awwwww...haha

Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' "Dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga, I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M, nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin, nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean?

Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Hood niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, "Sell dope, rap or go to NBA"
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen

Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola, my Dominicanos (Dímelo)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say "What up?" to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out (Come on), I could trip a referee (Come on)
Tell by my attitude (Come on) that I'm most definitely from
In New York (Ayy, uh, yeah; aha)

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it

Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (Uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
Or they could step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
"Hail Mary" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA (Come on) got you feelin' like a champion (Come on)
The city never sleeps (Come on), better slip you a Ambien
In New York (Ayy, ow, uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Okay)
Now you're in New York (Uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (Uh)

One hand in the air for the big city (Oh)
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty (Oh)
No place in the world that could compare (Nah)
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say

Ah, uh, whoo, yeah! Ready?

(Can I get a encore, do you want more?)
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boys
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise

Get 'em Jay!

Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back, yeah, hearin' me rap
Is like hearin' G Rap in his prime, I'm
Young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration-tion
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him-him
With cheap imitations for these generations

Can I get an encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boys
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh (Yeah)
Now, what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise
What the hell are you waiting for?

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you (Look how they wave to you)
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (Yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 45, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore (Come on)

I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb
Can I get a encore? Do you want more? (More, more, more)
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar

Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now (What's up?)
Only thing that's on my mind (What's up?)

I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is La Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up

Life's a game, but it's not fair (Yeah)

On the table, screamin', "Fuck the other side, they jealous"
We got a banquette full of broads, they got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in 'cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like Millionaires' Row

Life's a game, but it's not fair

Hey, hey, hey, hey

It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick, no homo
I bought my whole family whips, no Volvos
Next time I'm in church, please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' RAV4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life Good Will Hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, uh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
"What's that, Ye?" "Baby, these heels"
"Is that a May— what?!" "Baby, these wheels"
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel (What’s up?)

Hey, hey (Yeah, yeah)
Hey, hey (What’s up?)
Hey, hey
Hey, we gon' run this town tonight
What’s up?

Alright, alright
No church in the wild
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech

Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats

Sun coming up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read, "No apologies"
The other said, "Love is cursed by monogamy"
That's something that the pastor don't preach
That's something that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money, we can't keep
But we'll probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach

Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild

It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their only happiness
Squee'— Squee'— Squee'—
(Sounds so soulful, don't you agree?)
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her

Uh, I invented swag
Poppin' bottles, puttin' supermodels in the cab
Proof
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert, Hublots
Or the big-face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window, through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snapback, see my cut through the holes, Hov

Damn, Yeezy and Hov, where the hell you been?
Niggas talking real reckless, stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I'm 'bout to make 'em tuck they whole summer in
They say I'm crazy, well, I'm 'bout to go dumb again
They ain't seen me 'cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week, I was in my other, other Benz
Throw your diamonds up 'cause we in this bitch another 'gain

Photoshoot fresh, looking like wealth
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Uh, live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G450, I might surface
Political refugee, asylum can be purchased
Uh, everything's for sale
I got five passports, I'm never going to jail

I made "Jesus Walks," I'm never going to hell
Couture-level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermès of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive

You ain't accustomed to going through customs, you ain't been nowhere, hah?
And all the ladies in the house got 'em showing off

===== JAY-Z - Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem) =====
Take the bass line out
Uh-huh, Jigga
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Let it bump though

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, "Still, y'all don't know me."
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

Look for me
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is durin' Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder (Woo)
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B, holla
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend, that's right)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend

Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend

The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin', if ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my boyfriend, that's right)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend

I'll be there for you (Woo, uh)
If somebody hurts you (Uh)
Even if that somebody was me (Woo, that's hot)
Yeah-hee (Uh, break it down for 'em, B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be (Take 'em outside)
And so I put this on my life (Woo, uh)
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us (Woo, uh, woo)
And I promise I'll give my life (Woo, I'm dancin', woo)
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time)

Better trust and believe 'im
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts, then it's
"Beep beep," then I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'ma break bread
So you can be livin' it up? Shit, I
Parts with nothin', y'all be frontin'

Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho's there out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But, nigga, if you hate now
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get your ass to the back as I fly to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Posted up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man

===== JAY-Z - Why I Love You =====
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Picture, if you will, that the throne's burning
Rome's burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone, burning
Why does it always end up like this?
Something that we don't determine
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for, that I ride for
That I live for, that I die for
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead, but I'm sorry, but I just can't die for you
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
When the grief is over, beef is over
I'll be fly when Easter's over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
So when love is gone 'til blood is drawn
'Cause we no longer wear the same uniform
Fuck you, squares, the circle got smaller
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller
And truth be told, after all that said
Niggas still got love for you

Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know

Showed love to you niggas
You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
I picked up the pieces 'fore you swept on it
Goddamn, this shit leaves a mess, don't it?
Shit feelin' like death, don't it?
Charge it to the game, whatever's left on it
I spent about a minute, maybe less on it
Fly, pelican, fly, turn the jets on it
But first I shall digress on it
Wasn't I a good king?
Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?
Didn't I spoil you? Me or the money, what you loyal to?
Huh, I gave you my loyalty
Made you royalty and royalties
Took care of these niggas' lawyer fees
And this is how niggas rewarded me, damn

Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know

Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me
But I'm bulletproof, bitch, you can't get nothin' past me
Got body armor
A nigga gotta watch the throne
And I'm bussin' back
So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones
What do you do when the love turn to hate?
Gotta separate from these fuckin' fakes
Caesar didn't see it, so he ceased to exist
So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
Am I my brother's keeper?
Only if that nigga don't creep up
Got a pistol under my pillow
I've never been a deep sleeper
P-P-P-Paranoia, 'cause the nigga that said he'll
Blast for ya is now blastin' for ya
That's an assassin for ya
These niggas got a shot, they'll shoot
Please Lord, forgive him
For these niggas not know what they do, ooh

===== JAY-Z - 4:44 =====
Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?

Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
"Please come back to Rome, you make it home"
We talked for hours when you were on tour
"Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!"
I said: "Don't embarrass me" instead of "Be mine"
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn its death and
I apologize for all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best, you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize

I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh

I apologize
Our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over; "What if—"
"You over my shit?"

I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh

And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
"You did what with who?"
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
"You risked that for Blue?"
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay

I'm never gonna treat you like I should

===== JAY-Z - Young Forever =====
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? (Uh)
Forever young (Young), I wanna be forever young (Forever young)
(Ayy, may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young
(But we ain't even thinkin' that far, ya know what I mean?)

So we living life like a video (Video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture-perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'til you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (Yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me, baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young
(Just let it run)

Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches
Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (Hold up)
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous (Hold up)
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet?
I'm painting you a portrait of Young

Forever young, I wanna be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

All the ballers is bouncin' — they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'

Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryna get me a Rover (Woo)
Tryna stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the heckler close — you know them smokers'll test you
But, like, 52 cards went out — I'm through dealin'
Now, 52 bars come out — now, you feel 'em
Now, 52 cars roll out; remove ceiling in case 52 broads come out
Now, you chillin' with a boss, bitch, of course; "S.C." on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans (Woo), plus, the slippers is clean (Woo)
No chrome on the wheels (Woo), I'm a grown-up for real, chyeah!

If you feelin' like a pimp, nigga, go on — brush your shoulders off (Woo)

Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest that run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em — niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive — nigga, ask about me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammys
From O's to opposite Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'

===== JAY-Z - Points of Authority / 99 Problems / One Step Closer =====
If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!
Got 'em, Mike

He's got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes who wanna make sure his casket's closed
Rap critics who say he's money, cash, hoes
He's from the hood, stupid; what type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd be celebratin' the minute you was havin' dough
So fuck critics, you can kiss a whole asshole
You don't like the lyrics? You can press fast forward
Beef with radio if we don't play they show
They don't play our hits; we don't give a shit, so
All these mags tryin' to use our ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers
I don't know what you take us as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
From rags to riches, we ain't dumb
We got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!

Ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one, c'mon

Now the year is ninety-four, in my trunk is raw
In the rear view mirror is the motherfuckin' law
I got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor (C'mon)
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, "Son, do you know what I'm stoppin' you for?"
'Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
"You was doin' fifty-five in a fifty-four
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carryin' a weapon on you? Know a lot of you are"
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper legit
"Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
"Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or somethin'?
Somebody important or somethin'?"
Ha, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
"Well, we'll see how smart you are when the canines come"
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!

Ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!
Ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!
Ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one

Now once upon a time, not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin' and
He and his boys gon' be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' them
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mill' for bail 'cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got ninety-nine problems, bein' a bitch ain't one

Ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!
Ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

Shut up when I'm talkin' to you
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up when I'm talkin' to you
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!
I need a little room to breathe
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!
Everything you say to me
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one—hit me!
I need a little room to breathe
I got ninety-nine problems

Break

===== JAY-Z - Izzo (H.O.V.A.) =====
Ladies and gentlemen, let's put our hands together for this dynasty
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
To the eighth wonder of the world
The flow of the century
Always timeless
Hov
Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
I appreciate that
Uh

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese, I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof, vamoose, son of a bitch

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up (Holla at me)

I do this for my culture, to let 'em know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roadster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady, it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raisin' the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up

Yeah, Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack (Yeah)
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets busy
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

===== Ice Cube - No Vaseline =====
Damn
Forgot to do somethin', let me see, uh
Oh, yeah— it ain't over, motherfuckers
The motherfuckin' saga continues
Y'all motherfuckers ready for N.W.A? Well, get the fuck up
A bitch is a bitch, so if you're poor—
It was once said by a man who couldn't quit, dope—
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
But now, since he stepped the fuck off
Here's what they think about you
That punk Ice Cube—
Here's what they think about you
Cube was suckin' so much New York dick
Here's what they think about you
Real niggas? Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace
Here's what they think about you
Why y'all let his punk ass in the group
Here's what they think about you
When they was in London, they wasn't no good without fuckin' Ice Cube
Here's what they think about you
When I bought the tape, all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back
Here's what they think about you
I smell—
Here's what they think about you
N.W.A. ain't shit without Ice Cube
Here's what they think about you
Here's what they think about you
Cube was suckin' so much New York dick

Why y'all let his punk ass in the group
Here's what they think about you

When I bought the tape, all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back
Here's what they think about you
N.W.A. ain't shit without Ice Cube
Fuck all y'all

Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas, now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who you foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ayy, yo, Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you been a dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flow
You done run a hundred miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're getting fucked out your green
By a white boy, with no Vaseline

Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big bank take little bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Nah, cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for you, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide and conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
'Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the first team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh, yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline

Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done without Va— Va— Va— Va— Vaseline

I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E would be hanging from a tree
With no Vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
'Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking 'bout?
Get rid of that devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play The Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you
Eric Wright
Punk, always into something, gettin' fucked at night
By Mister Shitpacker
Bend over for the goddamn cracker
No Vaseline
Motherfuckin' nosejob havin'-ass
Motherfuckin' Jheri Curl light, Ambi wearing motherfuckin' bitch

===== Ice Cube - Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It =====
- Prior to gangsta rap music, the world was a peaceful place. And then all of that changed: violence, rape, murder, arson, theft, war. These are all things that came about as a result of gangsta rap music- But wasn't Compton dangerous before gangsta rap ?
- Wrong! Compton was a nature preserve for bunny rabbits. When gangsta rap came along, they tore down the country clubs and put up housing projects!
(Maestro!!!) Blame me!

It's R-A-W, R-A-W

You lookin' at the grand wizard
Warlord, vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches
To pull up, pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona
Ain't nothin' like a man that can do what he wanna
Ain't nothin' like a man that you knew on the corner
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga, I'm hot as Phoenix, Arizona
I'm Utah: I got multiple bitches
It's a new law, keep a hold of your riches
Dumb nigga, don't spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize I'm a captain and you a lieutenant

I can say what I want to say
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle, just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga
Y'all spit saliva, and I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this, ho, if you scared to go
I keep it gangsta, and why should I change that?
Fuck you old mothafuckas tryin' to change rap
But ain't you the same cat
That sat back when they brought cocaine back?
I'm tryin' to get me a Maybach
How you mothafuckas gonna tell me "don't say that"?
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971

So if I act like a pimp
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy-headed ho
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin' about real life
So you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain, not your back
Use your brain, not a gat; it's a party, not a jack
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal
And don't be material
A nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot Van Ness and imperial
Look at my life, Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
‘Cause me and Allah go back like cronies
I ain't gotta be fake, ‘cause he is my homie

If I sell a little crack
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow-flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R-A-W, R-A-W

Oh yeah, and another thing
For all y'all niggas that don't do gangsta rap
Don't get on TV talkin' about gangsta rap
‘Cause 9 times out of 10
You don't know the fuck you talkin' about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do
Stay the fuck out of mine

===== Ice Cube - You Know How We Do It =====
Yeah, yeah
Fool, you know how we do it
Westside
Comin' from the Westside
Nothin' but the Westside

Ain't nothin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on a tee lee, you don't wanna see a G
Break your ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes  like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Four-hoppin', ass-droppin'
Coupe DeVille, my troupe can kill
Fool, I got skills
So back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

Comin' from the Westside, Westside
Comin' from the Westside

Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud
Double-parked and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan, who got a plot
Who got got and who got shot
'Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin' out the window
Fool, I got them bomb-ass tapes
Da Lench Mob - Planet of da Apes
I'm down with Eiht and Watts Up
Kam and Solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want the bomb  just like George Clinton
S-K-P is down to catch a body
Put on "Knee Deep," we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

You know how we do it

Jack be nimble and Jack be quick
If you wanna jack me on a lick
'Cause I'm that fool from South Central
You'll think you stuck yourself  with a number two pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in your ass
With "More Bounce to the Ounce" in the dash
Mash up Van Ness, headed for the West
Everything is great , slow down for the dip
On 100 and 8th and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive to keep the four from crashin'
Stashin' a Glock and I thought you knew it
You know how we do it

Comin' from the Westside, Westside
Nothin' but the Westside
It's hittin' on the Westside
Fool, you know how we do it

===== Ice Cube - Check Yo Self =====

But steady talking shit in the holding tank

Will I shoot or keep you guessing?
'Cause fuck you and that shit you're stressing
Bitch, get off the wood, you're no good
There goes the neighborhood hooker (Slut!)
Go ahead and keep your drawers
Giving up the claps and who needs applause
At a time like this, pop the coochie and you dead
The bitch is a Miami Hurricane head
Sprung, niggas call her 'Lips & Lungs'
Nappy dugout, get the fuck out!

The motherfuckin' world is a ghetto
Full of magazines, full clips, and heavy metal
When the smoke settle
I'm just lookin' for a big yellow
In six inch stilettos
Dr. Dre, (Hello), perculatin', keep 'em waitin'
While you sittin' here hatin', yo' bitch is hyperventilatin'
Hopin' that we penetratin', you gets naythin'

Gangbang affiliatin', MC Ren'll have you
Wildin' off a zone and a whole half a gallon
(Get to dialing) 9-1-1 emergency
(And you can tell 'em) It's my son, he's hurtin' me
(And he's a felon) On parole for robbery
Ain't no coppin' a plea, ain't no stoppin' a G
I'm in the 6, you got to hop in the 3, company monopoly
You handle shit sloppily, I drop a key properly
They call me the Don Dada
Pop a collar, drop a dollar, if you hear me you can holla
Even Rottweilers follow the Impala
Wanna talk about this concrete? Nigga, I'm a scholar
The incredible, heterosexual, credible
Beg a ho, let it go, dick ain't edible

Take yo' notebook, yo' bitch and yo' Glock
This motherfucker thought the coochie had a padlock
You slapped her ass, that's alarmin'
'Cause she want my Worm like Carmen
We "Chin Check" niggas, them thin check niggas
Run trains on gold diggers, beware these fo' niggas
Scarin' motherfuckers like Stephen King flicks
Makin' niggas clear the room like a dyke fleein' dick
Makin' 2nd II None shit, nigga like Quik
So when I bomb first, nigga, who you rollin' with?
Fuck that ice on your wrist, fuck yo' fine ass bitch
'Cause you could lose it in a tussle, nigga, watch me hustle
Watch niggas kiss my ass without flexin' a muscle
Bitches, all in the back, they knees waitin' to buckle
Same time, same channel, don't change the dial
Niggas 4 Life, fuckin' your wife, these niggas wild (Hello)

I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?

Got you in your room rippin' every 'Chronic' poster on your wall off?
Just 'cause I put away the sawed off?
Now I got you sittin' back with a smirk, listening with your arms crossed
Questioning Dre's credibility (What?)
Wondering if it's still in me to produce hits – y'all be killin' me
As if I need to make mo'
I got a mansion, and six cars that are paid fo'
Suck my dick! (Hello) We came a long way from not givin' a fuck
Sellin' tapes out of a trunk, to movin' this far up
Now we got the whole world starstruck
Made a million-plus and still don't give a motherfuck
Motherfucker, I'm Dre! I don't need your respect
I don't need to make another album, bitch, I don't gotta do shit
I do it because I want to, not to stay in the game
Fuck the fame, I'm still stayin' the same – lil' bitch! (Hello)

===== Ice Cube - The Nigga Ya Love To Hate =====
I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga
That's why I'm sick of getting treated like a goddamn stepchild
Fuck a punk, 'cause I ain't him
You gotta deal with the nine-double-M
The day is coming that you'll all hate
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
They try to keep me from running up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about coming up
So what they do, go and ban the AK?
My shit wasn't registered any fucking way
So you better duck away, run and hide out
When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out
'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program
Shooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham
When I'm shooting, let's see who drop
The police, the media, and suckers that went pop?
And motherfuckers that say they too black
Put 'em overseas, they be begging to come back
And say we promote gangs and drugs
You wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug
Kicking shit called street knowledge
Why more niggas in the pen' than in college?
Because of that line, I might be your cellmate
That's from the nigga ya love to hate

(Fuck you, Ice Cube!)
Yeah, haha! It’s the nigga you love to hate
(Fuck you, Ice Cube!)
(Ay, yo, baby, your mother warned you about me)
It's the nigga you love to hate
(Yo, you ain’t doin' nothin' positive!
Yo, you ain’t doin' nothin' positive for the brothers, what you gotta say for yourself?)
(You don't like how I'm living? Well, fuck you)

Once again it's on, the motherfucking psycho
Ice Cube the bitch-killer, cap-peeler
Yo, running through the line like Bo, there's no pot to piss in
I put my fist in
Now, who do ya love to hate?
'Cause I talk shit and down the eight-ball 'cause I don't fake
You're begging I fall off
The crossover, might as well cut them balls off
And get your ass ready for the Lenching
The Mob is dropping common sense and
We'll gank in the pen', we'll shank
Any Tom, Dick and Hank, and get the ass spanked
It ain't about how right or wrong you live, but how long you live
I ain't with the bullshit
I meet mo' bitches, mo' hoes
Don't wanna sleep so I keep popping No-Doz
And tell the young people what they gotta know
'Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low
And, if you're locked up, I dedicate my stylin'
From San Quentin to Rikers Island
We got 'em afraid of the funky shit
I like to clown so pump up the sound
In your Jeep, make the old ladies say
"Oh my god — brake, it's the nigga ya love to hate"

(Fuck you, Ice Cube)
Yeah come on, fool, it’s the nigga you love to hate
(Fuck you, Ice Cube)
Yeah, what up, punk? It’s the nigga you love to hate
A bitch is a... ohh

Soul Train done lost they soul
Just call it train 'cause the bitches look like hoes
I see a lotta others, damn
It almost look like the Bandstand
You ask me, did I like Arsenio?
About as much as the Bicentennial
I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools
'Cause they all scared of the Ice Cube
And what I say, what I portray and all that
And ain't even seen the gat
I don't wanna see no dancing
I'm sick of that shit — listen to the hit
'Cause, yo, if I look and see another brother
On the video trying to out-dance each other
I'ma tell T-Bone to pass the bottle
And don't give me that shit about role model
It ain't wise to chastise and preach
Just open the eyes of each
'Cause laws are made to be broken up
What niggas need to do is start loc-ing up
And build, mold and fold they self into shape
Of the nigga you love to hate

===== Ice Cube - You Can Do It =====
Yay-yay
Get your ass up and hurr' up, uh
Ice Cube, baby

Life ain't a track meet (No), it's a marathon
Fuck the cemetery that a nigga get buried on
We be clubbin' 'til the day we die (Yay-yay)
Nigga, ask the bartender if you think we lie
But if you think we high, nigga, think again
'Cause when it's sink or swim, you got to think to win (Uh-huh)
And if I drink this Hen', everybody'll know it
'Cause I ain't going for it, so pray to the Lord
That I don't pull out, cuss out and bust out
Go the nigga route (Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click), make the trigger shout, uh
You can try to smoke an ounce to this
While I pronounce this shit, baby, bounce them tits

Now all I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones (What?)
The thug ones, relatives and my cousins
And I got 'em by the dozen
When they buzzin', quick to say fuck your husband
This is for my niggas locked away
Extra love for the ones who ain't got no date
But when we hit checkmate with Ice Cube the great (The great)
Soon as I get a word, we can rush the safe
Fuck them license plates because life is great
It don't matter if you're rich and your folks ain't straight

No matter how many niggas say we ain't the shit, bitch

Don't stop, get it, get it (That's real)

You can do it, put your back into it (C'mon)
I can do it, put your ass into it
Put your back into it, put your ass into it

I do hard core rhymin', hard time grindin'
Gorilla pimp hoes while other niggas wine and dine 'em
Gotta love this thug shit, S-Class in the mud shit
Pockets on flood shit, OG, lyrical Blood shit
I don't rent, I buy shit, niggas jealous of my shit
Unaware of this young nigga getting all this fly shit
While you're rootin' and recruitin', nigga, 6-8 hoopin'
I was in the hood shootin', plus I had the wife whoopin'
I come from Pyrex bowls and oversized jars
I'm past up stripes, I got stars and bars
No time for playa hatin', Mack paper chasin'
Kicked out the substation to the hip-hop nation
The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figgas
Done developed the status of a Platinum-plus nigga
Bust the first bad ho, fo' sho, I can I can hit it
I keep pushing, don't quit it, don't stop 'til I get it, uh

Don't stop, get it, get it (That's real)
Don't stop, nigga, hit it (I will)

===== Ice Cube - Why We Thugs =====
Yeah, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, come on

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a goddamn thang changed
It’s the same old same
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein
I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day-to-day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison?
Who's the animal that invented lower-livin'?
The projects, thank God for Russell Simmons
Thank God for Sugarhill
I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill
Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids
How these ghetto niggas taken over showbiz

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

It's boys in the hood, it's toys in the hood
Y'all wanna know why there's noise in the hood
‘Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood
Nigga killed a Crip and a Blood in the hood
‘Cause when niggas get tribal
It's all about survival, nobody liable
I got caught by Five-O
Grandmama came to court with her Bible
But when the judge hit the gavel
Now I'm too far from my family to travel
I just came unraveled
Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled
Owned by C.A, State Property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me, a one-way ticket out
Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

Damn, I can't take the pressure
Pulled the 4-4 up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming, but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
D game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' them up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Aye, y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
‘Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, stop trippin on it
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same

===== Ice Cube - Good Cop Bad Cop =====
Turn me loose

Whatcha doin', boy? Turn in that blood clot
Buck shots, they fly through that drug spot
Robots can give a damn who the fuck shot
Clean cop, clean cop, fuckin' with that dirty cop
Don't act like yo ass never heard of that
Clean cop, clean cop rollin' with that mean cop
Still tryna act proud as a peacock
You know that mean cop might need a detox
Mothafucka tried to blow me out my Reeboks
But I swing like Jack and the Beanstalk
Chop 'em down when these bitches try to lock me down
Hit the ground, hit the turf
Warp the earth
Cube kidnap your mind, Patty Hearst
Bust a verse that'll make yo ass hit reverse
Kill the curse that was placed on the universe
West Coast warlord blacker than the Black Knight
Fuck a black and white when they ain't actin' right
Good cop, good cop fillin' out your report
Bad cop asking you to distort
Bad cop asking you to lie in court
Send another young brother up north
Send another young sista off course
While these mothafuckas chill on the golf course

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop

Lazy cop fuckin' with that crazy cop
Always bragging 'bout the new case he got
Do-or-die cop with that suicide cop
Tell-the-truth cop, with that you-a-lie cop
Are you fuckin' high, cop? Don't even try cop
Ain't no mothafuckin' drugs up in my spot
All you find in my closet is the high tops
And my mothafuckin' tickets to the skybox
Hold up, nigga, I'm a rider
You's a roll-up, yep the controller
Make me mad that's when I get swole up (Don't touch me)
The Incredible Hulk is bipolar
Come out the cuffs, knock off the rust
Throw my hands (What's up?) up you still wanna bust
The Trojan horse is full of excessive force
When they try to get aggressive niggas off the porch (C'mon)

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop

Good cop, good cop, where is your dignity?
Where's your empathy? Where is your sympathy?
Bad cop, where's your humanity?
Good cop, is that just a fantasy?

Truth be told, mothafuck the blue code
Fuck the po-po actin' like Deebo
Already know Craig'll let the brick go
Black Lives Matter is not chit chatter
'Cause all they wanna do, is scatter brain matter
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
A nine is terrible in your face
The mace has a terrible fuckin' taste
The pen is a terrible fuckin' place (Let me out)
The kings all hate the fuckin' ace
The judge sabotaged my fuckin' case
Racist motherfucker

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop

===== Ice Cube - Nobody Wants to Die =====
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Y'all thought I was soft as cotton
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Messed around and forgot I was rotten
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
You know my resume
You tell 'em I'm on my way
But nobody (You tell 'em, I'm on my way)
Ah nobody wants to die

I keep my mind on my money, I keep my hand on my gunny
Don't get to playin' with sonny, unless you Playboy Bunny
I'll put four in your tummy, tap two in your brain
See the man ain't playing, if you think it's a game
Haters whisper my name, suckers want what I slang
Arrogant and I'm vain, DA want me to hang
But let me explain, like Abel and Cain
That the black Grim Reaper is not my brother's keeper
Revenge, revenge a killer's on a binge of revenge
It depends if I can live with my sins
Lose family and friends (lost em all)
Now you got to lose life and limb, spit phlegm on them
Got the code of Rakim, homey, jokes ain't allowed
And you boy ain't scared to move the crowd with something loud
If you doubt what I'm about, go ahead an run your mouth
I'm the last thing you see when your time is running out, trick

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
I'll send you fast boy, with a blast boy (first class, boy)
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Messin' with the wrong one, send you on that long run
Everybody wants to go to Heaven (I ain't the one, son)
Pop you like a pro, now you good to go (yeah)
But nobody (Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody)
Ah nobody wants to die

You forgot where I come from, you forgot what I do
You forgot what you was sayin', cuz I'm blockin' your view
Now I got you on cue, you about to turn blue
Get around me now you actin' like my little nephew
Boy what you wan' do? You ain't gon' do ish
But go take a ish, is 'bout as funky as it get
Now I'ma have to admit, that I was prolly too nice
But take my advice or I'll take your life
Now if you still wanna slice, let's start with the fingers
Let's move to the toes, and end with the penis
See men are from Mars, now you from Venus
How dumb you got to be tryin' to think with the genius
It's the big payback, you can't clown James Brown
See a brother been down ever since Jamestown
You either swim or you're drowned, you either gagged or you're bound
Now you can't make a sound, boy look at you now

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
I'll send you fast boy, with a blast boy (first class, boy)
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Messin' with the wrong one, send you on that long run
Everybody wants to go to Heaven (I ain't the one, Crip)
Pop you like a pro, now you good to go (Go on)
But nobody (Nobody, na)
Ah nobody wants to die

===== Ice Cube - Hood Mentality =====
The hood mentality is a crippling disease that attacks your nervous system
It makes you nervous of the system
Gangsters and hood rats are especially susceptible to this growth-stunting mentality
The hood is where I'm from, but it's not what I am
The hood is where I'm from, but it's not what I am

Fuck school nigga, I'mma be a dope dealer
I'mma be a killer, yep a urban guerrilla
I'mma stack scrilla, yeah buy me a villa
Sell a 5-0 to my auntie Priscilla
I don't give a fuck that she look like "Thriller"
Hit that shit one more time and fuck around and kill her
Cause I got the heart of a Pittsburgh Steeler
Black nigga draped in gold, with a nine milla
Love money, love jail, love that penitentiary mail
Love the way these niggas smell, keep coming back, can't you tell?
Love to see my mama cry, love to see my babies struggle
Love to see my woman juggle nuts cause she got to hustle
I don't give a fuck how my life go
Now I'm a slave man to this caveman without Geico
Everybody wanna call Michael a psycho
But he ain't never came through the hood with a rifle
Gunning niggas down cause they don't got the right clothes
Hit the wrong person cause we shoot just like hoes
First I was blood thirsty, Mister Mister Controversy
Now I wanna beg for mercy, should have took my ass to Berkeley

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality
How the fuck we supposed to change our reality?

Fuck school nigga, if I grow a little taller
Everybody tell me I'm gon' do it, I'm gon' be a baller
So fuck that thinking, fuck that thinking
Fuck them Lincolns, I want Franklins
Come back through here with my crew, I'm gon' have my own shoe
I'm gon' be that little fool coming in your living room
Starting point guard nigga, fresh out of middle school
Either it's the NBA or it's the NFL
I don't know what else I can do to keep my ass up out of jail
I wanna be like Tiger Woods, swing that club, make you sick
(I wanna be like Pacman Jones), (I wanna be like Michael Vick)
I wanna be like Barry Bonds, (I wanna be like O.J. Simpson)
Leave this field, leave this prison
Tell you motherfuckers where to kiss 'em
I wanna be all broke up, moving all old and slow
I wanna be a alcoholic just like Broadway Joe
I wanna be a sideshow, kinda like Iron Mike
Used to have a few Bentleys, now I just ride a bike

Fuck school nigga, they ain't trying to educate me
All they give a fuck is what I memorized lately
I'm gon' have to teach myself, clock that money, get that wealth
I wanna be like Santa Claus, I don't wanna be no fucking elf
No kid left behind but he get the runaround
Can't you motherfuckers see that they trying to dumb us down?
Don't trust the government, President is for sale
He don't give a fuck about a nigga, just a oil well
Sell crack, go to jail, bust a rap, go to hell
Do I got to sell my soul if I wanna go to Yale?
Go kiss Oprah's ass if you wanna be Gayle
I'd rather have my ass kissed up in Bloomingdale
You can go be a pimp, you can go be a ho
But you only gon' get paid off what you know
If you don't know shit, then you can't work for me
Cause you read your first book in the penitentiary

If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

===== Ice Cube - Black Korea =====
Every time I wanna go get a fuckin' brew
I gotta go down to the store with the two
Oriental one penny countin' motherfuckers
That make a nigga mad enough to cause a little ruckus
Thinkin' every brother in the world's out to take
So they watch every damn move that I make
They hope I don't pull out a gat and try to rob
They funky little store, but, bitch, I got a job
Look, you little Chinese motherfucker
I ain't tryin' to steal none of this shit
Leave me alone! (Mother fuck you, yo, yo, check it out)
So don't follow me up and down your market
Or your little chop suey ass'll be a target
Of a nationwide boycott
Juice with the people, that's what the boy got
So pay respect to the Black fist
Or we'll burn your store right down to a crisp
And then we'll see ya
'Cause you can't turn the ghetto into Black Korea

Mother fuck you

===== Ice Cube - Friday =====
You know it ain't no stoppin' all the dogs I'm droppin'
It's Friday night so everything is poppin'
I gots ten to spend on the Hen
So let the games begin
Yakety yak don't talk back or it's on
Callin' up Earl on the car phone
Mack 10 just got out of court
Rollin' through the hood in his super sport bumping Too $hort
Eighteens got the rear view mirrors vibratin'
And deep-dish Daytons
You know how we do it
Ain't nothing to it but the floss
Overcrowding Harrison-Ross
'Cause if you fuck with ours
We leave scars
Out of G-ride cars
Livin' like stars
Might hit the highway
On the Vegas run fool 'cause it's Friday

Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you don't care
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you don't care

Standing outside on a Friday living on the edge
'Cause we all got them hard heads
It's seems like we all are waitin'
For a drive-by playing tag with Satan
But we chillin', yeah, we ready and willin'
You hear about the latest westside killing?
Forty sippin', set trippin', fo' dippin'
Pistol grippin', never slippin'
BGs trying to hang out
But OGs sayin' "Take your little ass in the house"
My big homie just got out
Used to be down, now he's just cracked out
He is 'bout as hard as Darth Vader
In his sweatshirt, khakis and Chuck Taylor's
Just seen him in the driveway
Getting beat like a smoker fool, 'cause it's Friday

Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you don't care
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you don't care
Fool

Why must I be like that and chase the cat?
Or settle for a hoodrat
Dookie braids no dreadlocks
Flyin' in and out of town with half a chicken in her cock
And I love her 'cause she down
To fuck around with the underground pussy hound
And her ass is big round and wide
Jacked up, make a nigga down to ride
Smoking indo, playing that Super Nintendo
Hear a rat-a-tat on my window
Gave her ass that pelvic thrust
Don't trust the rubber 'cause its bound to bust
In the oven, in the nappy
I had on two so I was happy
'Cause that HIV'll make your dick hang sideways
And that ain't cool, fool, 'cause it's Friday

Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you don't care
Oh yeah
Throw your neighborhood in the air
If you don't care

Throw the West side in the air
Throw the East side in the air
Throw the South side in the air
Throw the North side in the air
Oh yeah!

===== Ice Cube - Steady Mobbin’ =====
God damn
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
And when dealin' with Da Lench Mob you gots to know steady mobbin' is not just the name of this jam
But a way of life
Bound together by motherfuckers that's known to break em' off something
Give it to me
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood

Four or five niggas in a mothership
Better known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit
Bent, front and back glass got tint
Tryin' to get our hands on some dollars and cents
And fools can't hold us
Every chance we get, we hittin' up the rollers
Comin' up short of the green guys
And I might start slangin' bean pies
Or the bootleg t-shirt of the month
With "U Can't Touch This" on the front
I'm out to get rich
'Cause life ain't nothin' but money and fuck a bitch
They drop like dominoes
And if you didn't know, Ice Cube got drama, hoes
So after the screwin'
I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings
I'm out the door
All you might get is a rubber on the floor
'Cause I'm ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti
Bitch, cause I'm steady mobbin'

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Steady mobbin'
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
There goes the neighborhood

Bustin' caps in the mix
Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six
'Cause I'm gettin' major
Fuck PacTel, move to Sky Pager
Told all my friends
Don't drink 8-Ball 'cause St. Ides is givin ends
Fools get drunk and wanna compete
Slapboxin' in the street
Niggas get mad, tempers are flarin'
'Cause they got a few bitches starin'
Just for the nappy heads
But scandalous bitches make for happy feds
I make it my duty to cuss 'em
Out 'cause I just don't trust 'em
And if you tell on me I'm bombin' on Betty
Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin'

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Steady mobbin'
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
There goes the neighborhood

Since one-time so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock
'Cause I'm rollin' on rims
Eating soul food, neckbones from M&M's
Grubbin' like a motherfucker
Greasy-ass lips, now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bellin'
When I hit a left on Ruthelen, "What up, loc?"
Don't you know that niggas get smoked
That take they life for a joke? Get in, nigga
I'll take you to the pad soon
Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my lowrider
Comin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob ain't nothin' but tramps
For hoes lickin' nuts like stamps
One fool bumpin' music for the yamps
But Ice Cube had more amps, get in, bitch
'Cause I had the jam on
And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon
Gimme the nappy and make me happy
The ho said, "Pappy, could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash?"
I said, "Yeah, but I don't play sex
Without puttin' on the latex"
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb, son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night, no longer steady mobbin'

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Steady mobbin'
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
There goes the neighborhood
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Steady mobbin'
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
There goes the neighborhood

There goes the neighborhood
Get the radio, get the radio
There goes the neighborhood

Ice Cube with Da Lench Mob, I got it goin' on
A nigga that's livin' in the city of the criminal zone
One-time can't keep the law in order
'Cause everybody's goin' crazy for a quarter
You're tuned in to the number one crew in the area
The way I'm talkin' I'm scarin' ya
I'm darin' ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag
Or beat down for ya flag
'Cause if you is or you ain't a gangbanger
Keep one in the chamber
'Cause you'll get them thangs put on ya son
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1
All the ol' school house fellows are crooks
So I get jealous looks
They keep thinkin' did my head grow?
Will the boys in the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?
Hell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay
I keep my nine anyway
For the day one of my homies wanna squab
I'm still rollin' wit Da Lench Mob

Them's the motherfuckers you don't wanna fuck with
(America's Most Wanted)

Back in the day I did my share of dirt
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable
To bust a cap 'cause it's all about survival of the fittest
I'm a menace crook
I did so much dirt, I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I repo your 'Vette, then jet
Back to the criminal set
I leave clue after clue, but they can't catch me yet
'Cause I'm slick and slippery
They can't get with me, cops ain't shit to me
I can't dig a pig, so I drop the dogs
And sweat em like sweathogs
And get mad, mad 'cause I'm the nigga that flaunt it
AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted

He said a motherfuckin' hamburger stand got broken in
Do I look hungry motherfucker?)
We got ways to make you move

Aiyo, here's what the poster read
"Ice Cube is wanted dead"
That's all it said
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green
Hear shots and si-reens
When I fiend, first they yo' rings, now they my rings
So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress
It's the American way
'Cause I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Ice Cube, a motherfuckin' klepto
And tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so
Who gets the worm?
And if I'm caught in a trap, you know I'ma beat the rap
With a payoff, cop gotta lay off
FBI on my dick, stay off!
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest
I'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest
So get the Kryptonite 'cause I'm a rip tonight
'Cause I'm scarin' ya, I'm wanted by America

Run nigga! Run nigga!
See ya!
(Aiyo Cube man, they on your ass)

Word, but who the fuck is Herb?
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs
Let 'em see a nigga invasion
Point blank on a Caucasian
Cocked the hammer, didn't crack no smile
Take me to your house, pal
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewelry
Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin' in the den, yo it couldn't be
(What up, G?) Saw my face on TV
Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out
Packed my bags and tried to hit the door when
The ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
'Cause the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin' my own kind
The police didn't pay it no mind
But when I start robbing the white folks
Now I'm in the pen with the soap-on-a-rope
I said it before and I'll still taught it
Every motherfucker with a color is most wanted

AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, uh,  reports that Ice Cube is the leader of the, uh, Lench Mob. Uh, also in the group they have J-Dee, T-Bone, Chill, Yo-Yo, Del, K-Dee
Sounds like a black thing

===== Ice Cube - Ghetto Vet =====
(Hey)
Hey Chop
(Hey)
These haters tried to blow me up, man
(Who is this)
The Don Mega, nigga, who you think
(Ey, homie, what happened)
My whole life flashed before my eyes, man

Life...
Niggas used to come and get me
When it was time to disagree with an enemy
Pass the Hennessy it gives me energy
Packed the gat in the small of my back
Where these niggas at, I'll clear the whole pack
Talking shit cause I'm down for my set
I'm a vet, smoking on a wet cigarette
Who these niggas think they are
Wishing on a ghetto star, I represent my tar
I start busting and they scatter like water bugs
Cause these Westside niggas is harder thugs
Enslave us but nothing can save us from sporting Ben Davis
Shootin' at your neighbors
Cause sometimes I feel like a nut
Don’t give a fuck when I open you up
Hot rocks
Fly from the back seat
And busta-ass niggas run like a track meet
And if you caught in the middle
Bleed more than a little (what)
Killer King is the hospital
Feeling numb from the bullets I hum
And when they hit
Black mothers have fits
I don’t give a shit

Fool I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
Check it
It's raining bullets and I'm still there
I'm still there

My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass
Up early in the morning taking out the trash
Feeling like a loser, alcohol abuser
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser
One on the pedals, the other on the handle bars
Tryna be ghetto stars
They said, "are you from the Westside is it so?"
I said, "hell yeah and who want to know?"
Me
In slow mo’, .44 slugs, face down in the mud
Puddle full of blood
Left for dead, the pain starts to spread
Now I can’t feel my legs
I meet Doctor Who at King Drew medical center
As I enter I.C.U
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital
I said I can’t move my legs, he said don’t try to
Now this ain’t the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again
I sit there motionless holding this pain inside contemplating suicide
At night I jerk and jerk
But my dick don’t work it don’t even hurt
Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube
A'be pissing through a tube
Fool I'm a vet

Fool, I'm a vet you can bet
I can dance underwater and not get wet (check it)
It’s raining bullets and I'm still there
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair

Fuck a V-A they need G-A
Gang Hospital for a cripple
Now I'm drinking Ripple
Same corner, same hood I'm still there
With bandanas tied to my wheel chair
To all the hood rat hoes I'm fired
They mad cause my tongue get tired
Now everybody want to put they dope on me
Sayin I won't get searched by the LAPD
I'm sittin' in a doorway deuce-five
Depending on that to keep my ass alive
I don’t got bows but my arm's about a one-six
With fucking legs looking like tooth picks
Some times I can’t deal
Got to beg the BG's to roll me up the hill
Put me on the porch
Now I'm on the torch
Smoking cocaine
Just to maintain
Nothing to gain nothing to lose
And last night I couldn’t make it to the bathroom
Feeling like a 2-year-old
You can’t get a sip from the brew I hold
It’s the only friend to a stranger
AKA: handicapped gangbanger
There's a lot in my life I regret becoming a ghetto vet
Fool I'm a Vet

Fool I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
Check it
It's raining bullets and I'm still there
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair
Fool I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
Check it
It's raining bullets and I'm still there
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair
Dedicated to all the ghetto vets
For every nigga that done took one for the hood

Maldición, amor o lujuria
Maldición, todos nosotros

Dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
No hay nadie, nadie que me supere
(¡Otro estreno mundial!)
Así que dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
Bebiendo champán, sintiendo con amor, viviendo con amor
Solo ámame
Quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...
Solo ámame, solo ámame, solo ama
Quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...
Ámame
Quiero estar contigo
Ámame, solo ámame

Si no tengo frenos sobre la acera, ¿todavía me amarías?
Si minimizo mi patrimonio neto, ¿todavía me amarías?
Mantente constante, preferiría que confíes en mí antes que amarme
Mantenlo al cien: no te tengo, no tengo nada

Ayy, tengo algo
Espera, nosotros funcionamos sin suposiciones
Me siento como Tyson con eso
Golpéalo dos veces, estoy con eso
Solo por la noche, estoy bromeando
Solo por la vida, sí, solo por la vida, sí
Solo por la vida, sí, consigamoslo
Golpea ese hombro delgado
Sé lo que significa
De espalda a altamar
Sé lo que necesitas
Ya en diez, todo el dinero entra
Todo sentimiento sale, este sentimiento no se seca
Esta fiesta no terminará

Si no tengo frenos sobre la acera, ¿todavía me amarías?
Si minimizo mi patrimonio neto, ¿todavía me amarías?
Mantente constante, preferiría que confíes en mí antes que amarme
Mantenlo al cien: no te tengo, no tengo nada

Dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
No hay nadie, nadie que me supere
Así que dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
Bebiendo champán, sintiendo con amor, viviendo con amor
Solo ámame
Quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...
Solo ámame, solo ámame, solo ama
Quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...
Ámame
Quiero estar contigo
Ámame, solo ámame

Estoy en camino
No tenemos tiempo que perder
Explota tu chicle en el camino (ámame)
¿Estoy en el camino?
No quiero presionarte
Quiero tu bendición hoy (ámame)
Oh, por cierto, abre la puerta por el camino
Te dije que estoy en camino (ámame)
Estoy en camino, sé que la conexión es vaga
Levanta el teléfono para mí, bebé
Maldición, interferimos
La mala actitud de tu abuela
Las curvas y caderas de tu abuela
Recuerda Gardena, tomé la cámara de estudio
Sé que Top estará enojado conmigo
Tuve que hacerlo, quiero tu cuerpo, tu música
Compré un anillo para probarlo
Mira lo que hiciste
Te dije que estoy en camino
Soy como un camino de salida, sí

Si no tengo frenos sobre la acera, ¿todavía me amarías?
Si minimizo mi patrimonio neto, ¿todavía me amarías?
Mantente constante, preferiría que confíes en mí antes que amarme
Mantenlo al cien: no te tengo, no tengo nada

Dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
No hay nadie, nadie que me supere

Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, "Breathe, bro"
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?

Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The "Other Vaginal Option"? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy

Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

Mm

Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again, like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead Redemption, scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was nine, on sale motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At twenty-nine, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
Five, four, three, two, one
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder, our DNA

===== Kendrick Lamar - PRIDE. =====
Love's gonna get you killed
But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealin’ with cold thumb
I’m willin' to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

Me, I wasn’t taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there

Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there

===== Kendrick Lamar - Swimming Pools (Drank) =====
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced
By what you are doin', I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock

Sherane
Sherane (Pool—Kendrick—Kendrick—lies in it)
Sherane, Sherane
(W-watch 'em all flock) Aw man…
Sherane (Girls wanna play-play-play)
Where is she takin' me? (I got)
Where is she takin' me? (Pool full of liquor, I'ma die in...)

All I—all I—all I—
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open, I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough
"They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off"
"That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'"
"We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' ru—they run opposite way
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that"
"And I hope that bitch that set him up, out there
We gon' pop that bitch too"
"Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody"
*Car door opens and gunshots are fired*
"Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?"
"L****, you good?"
"Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?
These bitch-ass niggas killed my brother!"

===== Kendrick Lamar - Alright =====
Alls my life, I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life, I—
Hard times like, "Yah"
Bad trips like, "Yah"
Nazareth
I'm fucked up, homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reapin' everything I sow, so my karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfuckin' gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?" Nigga
And we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy paintin' on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day, my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico, ah
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day, I sequel
If I got it, then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track, so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs, I write 'til I'm right with God

Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?" Nigga
And we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers

===== Kendrick Lamar - Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe =====
I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes, I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music, I would share it, but, today, I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the colorblind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people 'round me just wanna be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this

I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes, I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music, I would share it, but, today, I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

I'm tryna keep it alive and not compromise the feelin' we love
You're tryna keep it deprived and only cosign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourself, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock, I'ma break out and then hide every lock

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people 'round me just wanna be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this

I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes, I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music, I would share it, but, today, I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time, don't you see that long line?
And they waitin' on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend then put that pussy on the pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream, "It's alive"
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say, bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

K-Dot, get in the car, nigga
Come on, we finna roll out
Nigga, I got a pack of Blacks and a beat CD
Get your freestyles ready

Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millennium
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)

Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
On your pulse like it’s EDM

Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established, hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I’m a natural, I'm alright

I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I’m a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (Yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (Yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside

All I want is, all I want is

Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't vibe
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Are you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (Yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'

When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?

King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?

King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', "Compton!"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

===== Kendrick Lamar - Poetic Justice =====
Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go

(In the thundering rain)
I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, it's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS

(An-an-an-an-anytime)
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it (And any place)
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
(An-an-an-an-anytime)
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it (And any place)
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
(In the thundering rain)
I really hope you play this 'cause, oh, girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day, when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS

(An-an-an-an-anytime)
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it (And any place)
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
(An-an-an-an-anytime)
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it (And any place)
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

(In the thundering rain)
Every time I write these words, they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steerin'
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhm
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mhm
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, PS

(An-an-an-an-anytime)
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it (And any place)
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ask him if he over here for Sherane
Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?
I don't care who this nigga over here for
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap, I'm sorry
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or, or, or where your grandma stay
Where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, okay?
Fuck all this talkin'
As a matter fact, get out the van, homie
Get out the car 'fore I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie

You're back outside, but they still lied
Woah-oh-oh-oh (Yeah)

Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm taking off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (Take that shit off)
Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (Take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mil', hell if I know (Take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (Take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (Take it off)
Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, "I'm broke, I care" (Take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (Take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag (Take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

Bitch, huh, huh, ugh
You ugly as fuck (You outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (Hah, hah, hah, hah)
You steppin' or what? (You outta pocket, huh)
Who you think they talk about?
Talk about us (You outta pocket—shoot, shoot, shoot)
Who you think they copy off? (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
Copy off us (Get back in pocket)

The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run
The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage, the market is crashin', the industry wants
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they makin' a mockery followin' us
This ain't Monopoly, watchin' for love, this ain't monogamy, y'all gettin' fucked
Jumpin' on what the hell is that? I gotta relax when I feel (Huh, facts)
All my descendants, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (Huh, facts)
I'm done with the sensitive, takin' it personal, done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right
You hopin' for change and clericals, I know the feelings that came with burial's cries

Bitch, huh, huh, ugh
You ugly as fuck (You outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (Hah, hah, hah, hah)
You steppin' or what? (You outta pocket, huh)
Who you think they talk about?
Talk about us (You outta pocket—shoot, shoot, shoot)
Who you think they copy off? (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
Copy off us

Servin' up a look, dancin' in a drought
Hello to the big stepper, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the sa—
Can I vent all my truth? I got nothin' to lose, I got problems and pools, I can swim on my faith
Cameras movin' whenever I'm movin', the family suin' whatever I make
Murder is stackin', the president actin', the government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm bracking, look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Hold up, hold up)
Let's think about this for a second (Let's go)
Tell me what you would do for aesthetic (Let's go)
Would you sell your soul on credit? (Let's go)
Would you sell your bro for leverage? (Let's go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Let's go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Let's go)

Huh, huh, ugh
You outta pocket, yeah, you outta pocket (This shit hard)
You entertain the mediocre, need to stop it (This shit hard)
You entertainin' old friends when they toxic (This shit hard)
What your life like? Bullshit and gossip (This shit hard)
What the fuck is cancel culture, dawg?
Say what I want about you niggas, I'm like Oprah, dawg
I treat you crackers like I'm Jigga, watch, I own it all
Oh, you worried 'bout a critic? That ain't protocol (Bitch)

We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know

If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy

Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists

If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy

All my life, I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn, I feel amazin', damn, I'm in the Matrix
My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and, vroom, vroom, I'm racin'
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winnin', screamin'

All my life, I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn, I got bitches (Okay), damn, I got bitches (Okay)
Damn, I got bitches (Yeah), wifey, girlfriend, and mistress
All my life, I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower

I got twenty-five lighter on my dresser, yes, sir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
That Adina Howard had, pop it fast to impress her
She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum, imposin'
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and

All my life, I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn, I got bitches, damn, I got bitches
Damn, I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend, and mistress
All my life, I want money and power
Respect my mind or, nigga, it's go time

I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run that ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "K, you gon' marry mines"
Biatch, no way, biatch, no way
Biatch, no way, biatch, okay
I'm never livin' life confined
It's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell you who, what, when, where
How to sell your game right on time
Biatch, go play, biatch, go play

Uh-uh, fuck that

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he feel today
You know when you part of Section.80
You feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is Black, she Black too
Purple Label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head, then she look at me
She got ADHD

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Like woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
(They always told me ADHD did it)
Woah, woah-woah

And then she started
And then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
"Beg your pardon? Oh, I rap, baby, how old are you?"
She say twenty-two, I say twenty-three, "Okay, then we are crack babies," damn
"Why you say that?" She said, "Where my drink at?"
"I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax"
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen, Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said, "Read between the lines," yep
Hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body, and I know the both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound (Woah)
Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me, then looked
At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, "Get it understood"
"You know why we crack babies? Because we born in the '80s
The ADHD crazy"

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Like woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
(They always told me ADHD did it)
Woah, woah-woah

You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

Few solid niggas left, but it's not enough
Few bitches that'll really step, but it's not enough
Say you bigger than myself, but it's not enough (Huh)
I get on they ass, yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll make them niggas mad, yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll take the G pass, shit, watch a nigga do it
Huh, we survived outside, all from the music, nigga, what?

They like, "What he on?"
It's the alpha and omega, bitch, welcome home
This is not a song
This a revеlation, how to get a nigga gone
You need you a man, baby, I don't understand, baby
Pay your bill and makе you feel protected like I can, baby
Teach you somethin' if you need correction, that's the plan, baby
Don't put your life in these weird niggas' hands, baby (Woah)

Few bitches that'll really step, but it's not enough
Say you bigger than myself, but it's not enough (Huh)

Hey, turn his TV off
Ain't with my type activities? Then don't you get involved
Hey, what, huh, how many should I send? Send 'em all
Take a risk or take a trip, you know I'm trippin' for my dog
Who you with? Couple sergeants and lieutenants for the get back
This revolution been televised, I fell through with the knick-knacks
Hey, young nigga, get your chili up, yeah, I meant that
Hey, black out if they act out, yeah, I did that
Hey, what's up, though?
I hate a bitch that's hatin' on a bitch and they both hoes
I hate a nigga hatin' on them niggas and they both broke
If you ain't coming for no chili, what you come for?
Nigga feel like he entitled 'cause he knew me since a kid
Bitch, I cut my granny off if she don't see it how I see it, hm
Got a big mouth but he lack big ideas
Send him to the moon, that's just how I feel, yellin'

It's not enough (Ayy)
Few solid niggas left, but it's not enough
Few bitches that'll really step, but it's not enough
Say you bigger than myself, but it's not enough


Huh

Hey

Got my foot up on the gas, but somebody gotta do it
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off

Ain't no other king in this rap thing, they siblings
Nothing but my children, one shot, they disappearin'
I'm in the city where the flag be gettin' thrown like it was pass interference
Padlock around the building
Crash, pullin' up in unmarked truck just to play freeze tag
With a bone to pick like it was sea bass
So when I made it out, I made about 50K from a show
Tryna show niggas the ropes before they hung from a rope
I'm prophetic, they only talk about it how I get it
Only good for saving face, seen the cosmetics
How many heads I gotta take to level my aesthetics?
Hurry up and get your muscle up, we out the plyometric
Nigga ran up out of luck soon as I upped the highest metric
The city just made it sweet, you could die, I bet it
They mouth get full of deceit, let these cowards tell it
Walk in New Orleans with the etiquette of LA, yellin'

Mustard (Ah, man)
Niggas actin' bad, but somebody gotta do it
Got my foot up on the gas, but somebody gotta do it
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off

He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 a.m. on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night, I hear 'em talk (Me)
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless? (How, how?)
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like love to start shit
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you, Yeezy?"
And try to hit you with the ol-wu-wopte
'Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know?

I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thing
I know I was foul, baby
A-bay, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Frontin' though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', "Hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar"

But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard, she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week, he moppin' floors, next week, it's the fries
So stick by his side

===== Kanye West - POWER =====
I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)

The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)

Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doing? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'

Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window, letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

I've been waitin' on this my whole life (And I wonder)
These dreams be wakin' me up at night (And I wonder)
You say I think I'm never wrong (And I wonder)
You know what? Maybe you're right, aight?
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

You say he get on your fuckin' nerves (And I wonder)
You hope that he get what he deserves—word! (And I wonder)
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just tryna find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet, and that's what intuition is (And I wonder)
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib, run back to their arms
The smokescreens, the chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder
And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline, told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline

Why he keep givin' me hot lines?

How many ladies in the house without a spouse? (What it means)
Somethin' in your blouse got me feelin' so aroused (What it means)

===== Kanye West - Homecoming =====
Yeah
And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
-Min' home again

I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, but
My name is Windy and I like to blow trees," and
From that point, I'd never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me"
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me"

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes, I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you," and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
Comin' home again
Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
Comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

===== Kanye West - All Falls Down =====
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all

Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, "Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair"
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it all falls down
Oh, when it all

Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this"
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some 1s that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down

I say, "Fuck the police," that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou'
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou'
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

*Applause*
I can't keep workin' like this
This grave shifts is like a slave ship

===== Kanye West - Violent Crimes =====
Fallin', dreamin', talkin' in your sleep
I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see

Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (Night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (Night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off
I'm saying it like...
"I want a daughter like Nicki, aw, man, I promise
I'ma turn her to a monster, but no ménages"

===== Kanye West - Can't Tell Me Nothing =====
La, la, la-la (Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

I had a dream I could buy my way to Heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

La, la, la-la (Ayy!)
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la-la (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (Yeah! Haha!)
You can't tell me nothing (Yeah! Yeah!)
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (Yeah!)

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life, homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, "Back in my day"
But homie, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then
Aight, man, holla, then

La, la, la-la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la-la (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a–uh–depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
With way less effort
'Cause when you try hard, that's when you die hard
Your homies looking like, "Why, God?"
When they reminisce over you, my God

La, la, la-la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la-la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
(I'm serious, nigga, I got money)

Pardon, I'm getting my scream on (Black)
Enter the kingdom (Black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in (Black)
Came to see me in my black skin (Black)
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' (Black)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics (Black)
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq, bitch

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up 'cause this shit 'bout to go (Down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (Now)
But there's nowhere to go (Now)
And there's no way to slow (Down)

Early morning cartoon shit (Black)
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit

Back out the tomb, bitch (Black)
Black out the room, bitch (Black)
Stop all that coon shit (Black)
These niggas ain't doin' shit (Black)
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on, homie, what happened?
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action-action

I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans

But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Woo, woo
Swizz told me let the beat rock (Oh)

If you see 'em in the streets, give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)

From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!

She in school to be a real estate agent
Last month, I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky

===== Kanye West - Ghost Town =====
Someday, someday
Someday, I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown

Someday, someday, someday
I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Someday, somedays, I remembered this on a Sunday
Backway, yeah, way, way, burning, mhm-mhm
Uh, someday, I'm gonna tell everybody
Somedays, I wanna hit the red dot on everybody
Someday, ohh (Heatstroke)
Everyday I'm livin' high, I'm smokin' marijuana
Everyday I'm livin' high, I do whatever I wanna, oh, yeah

I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

Someday, we gon' set it off
Someday, we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday, the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes, I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what they had in mind
But maybe someday

I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

Woah, once again, I am a child
I let it all go of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free

===== Kanye West - Devil In A New Dress =====
Uh
Uh
I love it, though
I love it, though, huh, you know?
Uh
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation, uh
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan, haha
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her make-up, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, "This what you really wanted, huh?"
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but she done learned a lot from Satan, huh
Satan, Satan, Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Ma$e screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase, so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat, haha
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme," not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?

Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation, haha
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh)
Uh

Ayy, time is extremely valuable
And I prefer to waste it on girls that's basic
That's just some Ye shit

Hm, mhm, if I see you pull up with the three stripes

Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 a.m., summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting our dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
I'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turnin' back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

Tell me, what you know about the night terrors every night?
5 a.m., cold sweats, waking up to the sky
Tell me, what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me, what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

===== Kid Cudi - Erase Me - Main =====
She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me, hmm
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me

She said I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you (Yeah)

It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete (Yeah)
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete (Hmm)
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me

She said I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

Yeah, 'cause I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you are, you might hear me (Uh)
I'm in the magazines (Yeah), on the TV
No matter where you go, you might see me (Hello, haha)

Uh, I'm Yeezy, she say "Hi, I'm Aria"
No, you a angel, you wave "Hi" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, you something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, she'll take you to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, "No, not my Aria"
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die, Aria

She said I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

===== Kid Cudi - Soundtrack 2 My Life =====
I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You knowin' how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram'
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it, Mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
"Why he by himself?"
He got two older brothers; one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me
Scotty

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room
And soon, I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

I'm this close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope, man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down; pussy, and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

To my life, to my life, to my life...
Uh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

===== Kid Cudi - Tequila Shots =====
Duh-duh-duh, duh, duh, duh
As he falls back deeper, into a state
The return (Dot Da Genius, baby)
(Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

Nights my mind is speedin' by, I'm holdin' on
Askin' God to help 'em, are you hearin' me?
Girl is tellin' me she don't know what she want
Lotta demons creepin' up, they're livin' underneath
Gotta take a minute, y'all, traveled far
Feelin' somethin', no, I can't ignore my instincts
Back just where I started, it's the same old damaged song
It's the shit I need

Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Hm, talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't losе, I'm in the third act
Lord seein' me swervе
Do this to my loved ones, I've got some nerve
Don't think I'm not sorry

Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

Hm, I been here before
Hm, hm, I been here before, hm
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
As the story goes, hey, hey
As the story goes, hm
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me

(Yeah) Standin' on the cliff right off Mulholland Drive
(Yeah) Back up on my late night session remedy
(Oh) Something 'bout the night that keep me safe and warm
Just me, the universe, and everything I think
Lotta shit is weighin' on me, it's a storm
Never thought I would be back here bleeding
I'm not just some sad dude
You can see my life, how I grew, I want serenity

Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't lose, I'm in the third act
See, it seems I'll never learn
I won't stop 'til I crash and burn
Tell my mom I'm sorry

Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it

===== Kid Cudi - Just What I Am =====
I'm just what you made, God, not many I trust
I'ma go my own way, God, take my fate to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryna get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin', bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga, don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, "Ain't no music on", she said, "Nah, that weed is loud"
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

I (I need) need smoke (Oh, oh, oh, I need)
I (I need) need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I-I wanna get high y'all (Woah)
I-I wanna get high y'all
Nee-need it, need it to get by y'all (Woah, yeah)
Can you get me high y'all? (Hey)
I-I wanna get high y'all

I'm just what you made, God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-nee-need it) I'm just what you made, God
I'm just what you made, God, I'm just what you made, (Mmm)

Let me tell you 'bout my month y'all
Endless shopping, I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don't think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain't wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain't working fam
In-In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray, but if you had my life you'd understand
But, I can't fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We're all troubled in a world of trouble
It's scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I'm what you made, God, fuck yes, I'm so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren't my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Every day to find sane's a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

I (I need) need smoke (Oh, oh, oh, I need)
I (I need) need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I-I wanna get high y'all (Woah)
I-I wanna get high y'all
Nee-need it, need it to get by y'all (Woah, yeah)
Can you get me high y'all? (Hey)
I-I wanna get high y'all
I-I-I wanna get high y'all
Nee-need it, need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all? (Hey)

I'm just what you made, God, just what you made, God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made, God, I'm just what you made

Nee-need it to get by y'all

===== Kid Cudi - Up Up & Away =====
Now when the sun come up
I'll be there to say "What up" in the morning
Brush my teeth
Find that clip I been looking for since last night
I feel so caught up in the bud
I float somehow in my bedroom
Turn around
See myself in the mirror, I guess I'm cool
And those happy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan
Minus the tights and the fairies
Happy to see how far I've come
To the same place it began
My dreams and imagination
Perfectly at peace
So I move along a bit higher

I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever

Uh, higher learnin'
I see the dreams I made
So I'm cooler now
I can take care of my mom and my little niece Zuri
So sing along, lil mama
You ain't gotta worry 'bout no drama, no
I provide for friends and fam and fans
And Cleveland City grinding, man
Stay afloat, the key is hope
I'll never let a motherfucker break me, dawg
Who gives a fuck? If a nigga don't like your steeze
Tell 'em to buzz off your N-U-T's
We don't care what people say
Dudes who critique your clothes are most gay
I ain't gotta wait for no one
If I wanna fly, I can fly for freedom, hey

I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever

Wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake (Yeah)
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
(We'll be rolling one up)
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
(We'll be rolling one up)
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
(We'll be rolling one up)
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
(We'll be rolling one up)
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
(I'll be rolling one up)
Wake, wake up, wake up, wake, wake up, wake
(I'll be rolling up)

I'll be up up and away, up up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up up and away, up up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever

Whatever
So, whatever
Whatever
So, whatever
The end is never the end
A new challenge awaits
A test no man could be prepared for
A new hell he must conquer and destroy
A new level of growth he must confront himself
The machine and the ghost within
This is the journey, of the Man on the Moon

Rapping in the booth in a Triple Fat Goose hazmat suit
Bubble wrap and a mask too and
I don't think that's what they meant by trap music (Nah)
Running through ink like I'm tattooing (Yeah)
This is music to be murdered by, you love

===== Kid Cudi - Cudi Zone =====
Soarin', is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact, now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can’t rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Done pimpin', you can think about marriage, until then, get it
Then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute
I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zoned, see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah, homie, not even
I'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember
I'ma be gone way past November
Even, stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin'
I can find peace somewhere

In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland City we ride around
Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall, I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes, they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded, man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so
My vice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin', all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin'
I will find peace somewhere

In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all


In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

She had her hair did, it was bound to fall
Down, down for a damn, Cudi already said it
A pokerface book I already read it
But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body known to blow fuses
A stripper from the south lookin' for a payday
Said bitch you should do it for the love like Ray Jay
But they say you be on that conscious tip
Get your hair right & get up on this conscious dick

God, I thought I loved you so
God, I thought I loved you so

They done let in the skinny jean-wearing
Fro-for-days in a old AA
Ball' so low, most fools couldn't price me
Silently stunt with a blunt full of P.E.
And I guess you know me
Been in NY so long, got Tri-State family
Especially Brooklyn—shout-out to the Madis
My bloodline runs deep
Nights, I don’t sleep
Figure it’s my pops keeping me awake
Help me keep my mind out the clouds for reality
These motherfuckers can’t fathom the wizardry
Slow-mo-brain, ass-backwards cowards
Take a shower, your attitude stinks
Wanna know what I think

Oh, oh-oh, oh
Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch
My mojo so dope
Yep, we live it, live it
Yeah, we on it, on it

Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucker lifestyle, 'cause, nigga, hey

I live through words, not metaphors
So I passed to be the rest of the freshmen
Playful tough talk, often the fave
'Til I came like 'Pac art and said true things
A whole new legion of some niggas
Aiming high, past the idea of slanging
Praise Allah for keeping me away, man
Lotta of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
Some things will never be the same
Wish that I could tell my brother
Something for some motivation to get him out that gutter
He’s leaving behind a family and a mother
Damn, you must understand
What I speak about in song, this how I really am
Yeah, this is how I really think
You can see what I see, yes, I really blink
Yes, I really drink, I really do rage
My demons out the cage 'bout most of the day
Before I became the age to even rage
I was drowning my sorrows with some O.E., nigga

Hey, we live this shit
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch
My mojo so dope
Yep, we live it, live it
Yeah, we on it, on it

On, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and
And we dream
Oh, oh-oh, oh
On, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and

===== Kid Cudi - Baptized In Fire =====
Mmm, easy, back up, back up, back up, back up, uh
Turn your radio, turn your radio, off
Watch me now, baby (Baby)
Uh-uh, uh-uh

Bitches in my ear, they sayin' they love me
Uh, you don't love Scott, you love the Kid Cudi
I ain't no fuckin' slouch, show you what I'm 'bout
My energy is a bit too precious, too drenched in them blessings
Transitionin' to my inner, I'm hearin' their voice
Tellin' me stay in focus, keep focusin', boy
Feelin' like a trilli billi
The man everywhere I go, in any city
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls galore
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls adore
Mixin' fluorescent to the core of the accoutrement
Off the tippy titty, settin' off my groupie radar
Sippin' Hen', dappin' hands off the roof of my Porsche
A fresh nigga at large, a fresh nigga go hard
All my youngins say, "Keep it goin'"
All my youngins, they dumb and reppin', they always knowin'

Got some pride in your town, I'm spottin' 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm lookin' so cute
Sexy mama, send her way, you doin' it, honey
Them hatin' fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this, my nigga, you be here (Be here)
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here (Ain't here)
Big boss, I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)
Can't stop me, can't carry me, baby

Life ain't easy sober, we live so geeky (Yeah)
Did just what you taught us, kept peace, no drama (Yeah)
Phoned home to the moon, did you change your number?
If and when you get this message, need you back home
Big bro, big bro, big bro (Yeah), big bro, back home
Big bro, we need you, come home, back home
Big bro, big bro, shit's fucked, come home (Mmm)

High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher
High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher (Ayy, ayy)

Nightmares kept a nigga from closin' his lids (Lids)
Since a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip
Think they gone, nah, they just dormant, the hauntings ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are comin' for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage, turn the page, relaxin', I'm whippin'
Last week, I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefin' good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?
Nah, nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call
My nieces know Uncle Scottie's so rock and roll
My princess Vada know rock and roll, Daddy got the glow

Got some pride in your town, I'm spottin' 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm lookin' so cute (Yeah)
Sexy mama, send her way, you doin' it, honey
Them hatin' fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this, my nigga, you be here (Be here)
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here (Ain't here)
Big boss, I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)
Can't stop me, can't carry me, baby

===== Kid Cudi - Man on the moon =====
I'm often often, sittin' in my world in the coffin, coughin off the herb of the curb
Money, money, money is what they concur
Do they Agree? what they might see, could be
Not exactly what they thought
The car the rap star allgededly bought is probly the same car that the rap star rented
Front end in tennis, supreme in the snowfish
Tailin' the whip, parkin lot a double piece, parked then
My mom swore that I'd be the next come up
Them otha niggas far from it
Can't stand how these dick rock bandits even get granted the access
All up in the mix
Wanna be a Kanye
Wanna be a Skateboard P, but nigga
All the BBC cannot put you, in the same place or give you the same face
Find you first and you couldn't raise the stakes, higher
Not talkin shit just fire, please muthafucka
All this BAPE shit I rock is none otha
Who the best MC's in the Cleve?
Cas, Chip, da Cudder, triple da illness
And Ohio gotta feel this
Took a decade just to say I'm paid
Took a took a decade just to get girls to lay down, spread eagle, pop dat pussy ho'
Need the love below I'm the champ that needs a gold medal
Styles of flow homeboy, I got plenty
I payed for my noodle, the digital vortex. Textin' a freak
Digital phone sex
She wanna suck a dong 'cus my songs got me digital checks
Gigabytes decide the words that I write, I get gone nigga day and night
Unh. Take it literally
How more crystal clear can I be?
How more crystal clear can I be?
How more crystal clear can I be?

===== Kid Cudi - Alive (nightmare) =====
So mean
So mean

Every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
And every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah

I'm feeling strange in the night
I'm not myself, I feel I'm thrown into a fight
Ah, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, nothing's right
My skin is burning and my heart begins to speed
There's something going wrong with me
I am changing rapidly, ay
I'm feeling stronger, more alert, I'm on the move, mm
I smell her scent, and I know I will find her soon, soon, soon
The one to come and free me from this fate
I'll find her, it's not too late, hey, hey

Every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
And every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah

I'm a beast in the night
I'm on the prowl while I'm hoping to find some light
You call it Heaven, I do too, we feel the same
Ain't nothing wrong, I'll be feasting on something brave, ay
A sexy lady who's pure, she has the cure, ah
I hope she can find the man within the beast, and
I hope she saves me from the curse I have to beat, hey
I hope she figures out a way to save my soul
Yeah, to save my heart, hey

Every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
And every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na
Whoa, na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na
Whoa, na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na

I watch the sun collapse and took up in the clizzoud
I am the lone wolf, go where I wanna
Let the moon shine, be the guide to the lizzight
Even when I stray away, the light never left me
Uh, I learn to follow my instinct
Blinded by the light, rather that than the evil
Feelin' out of place in a room full of people
Try and be the same, but you know you're not a sequel
Your fate will be
Whatever it shall be, be, be, be, be
Won't fight no more
I let these things just be, be, be, be

Every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
And every time the moon shines
I become alive, yeah

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na
Whoa, na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na

Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light

Born from dusk to dawn, I am truly alive
The satellite that sits in frame to illuminate this shaded place
He's a rose that don't belong, the music, the magic, take the lead
Come on with it, mmm, come on

Moments don't pass me up, no, no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith
In the choices you made, it's all by design
Go with it, mmmm
Come on, don't fuck up the feng shui
Feng shui, feng shui, feng shui, feng shui
I see everything with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
When you think too much you're removing what's moving
Stuck inside a statue, look at you (Oh)
Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you (Oh)
A petty logo, shed all my tattoos (Oh)
I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful

Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light

The universe never steered me wrong
The universe never lied
Take me bound to the come me down
The fantasy in this remedy
Free from where you don't belong in the concept of time
New levels, mmm, come on

'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith

Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light

Feel I'm being tested every minute
Feel like yesterday I was blind, I've been lost
Seems like I've stumbled on a path, no coincidence
Truly in my essence, I've arrived
Who am I? Who am I? Don't remind me
Too alive, too alive, new arriving
You were right, I was left in it before
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne
Parallel to paradise
I reach out for my lifeline
The angels laugh in paradise
They say I am my own lifeline, look in you
To the night, to the night I'm abandoned
To deny, to deny, what a sandpit
Couldn't I, couldn't I have an angel?
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne

So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah
I savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui

Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him (Him)
If you did it then, then you'd probably **** again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian

Hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(No! No, no, I don’t think so)
I say it for me, uh, I’m an adult I say, wait
“You’re too young to be in love, this is silly
You’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas”
I mean, it might be something I don’t know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What’s the difference?
(Okay. You can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this—you’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(Maybe they ain’t never been loved before or been in love before, they don’t know what the feeling is to be loved)
(She poetic)
She killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right?

===== Lauryn Hill - To Zion =====
One day, I'm gonna understand
Zion

Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man-child would be born
Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
"Look at your career," they said
"Lauryn, baby use your head"
But instead I chose to use my heart

Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, Zion!)
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, uhh, Zion!)

How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you, my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face

That the joy (Joy)
Of my world (World)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion)
Now the joy (Joy)
Of my world (World)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion, is in Zion)
Now the joy (Joy)
Of my world (World)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion, is in Zion)
Now the joy (Joy)
Of my world (World)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion, is in Zion)

Okay, how many people here have ever been in love? I know none of the guys are gonna raise their hand. How many of y'all ever been in love?

(Mumbling)

I know none of the guys been in... we don't get in love, right? Oh! Let this black man right here tell what his idea of love is, 'cause not all the time we hear a young black man talk about love. About your personal definition, don't tell me what Webster thinks. Huh?

Willingness to do everything for that person

Okay, everything like what? Explain. Let him talk, c'mon. If I asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. But we wanna talk about love. You can do it. (To another pupil) What do you think? You said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right?

The way they act

Uh-huh

The way they carry themselves, stuff like that

Okay

The way that they hang with they boys, and they just stand out. It's like sometimes it don't even matter like what they wear or what they look like. It's like, that way, you know?

Yeah

It's like you know you want to talk to him, because he stands out, it's like he got a glow or something

That's deep

That's what I'm talking about

I thought that was a beautiful point. Anyone else want to deal with that?

It's sometimes, like when they try to act funny in front of they boys, like when they get around say they love you. They can't love you. 'Cause love-love-love wouldn't do that

Love is not phony!

(Laughter)

===== Lauryn Hill - Lost Ones =====
It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication lead to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young Lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand, L-Boogie, non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son
L been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you wanna bawl over separation
Tarnish my image in the conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?
You might win some, but you just lost one

You might win some, but you just lost one
You might win some, but you just lost one
You might win some, but you just lost one
You might win some, but you just lost one

Now, now, how come your talk turn cold?
Gained the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you're all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm on Hope Road
Every man wanna act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always wanna play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't wanna hear my opinion
There come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See, you might win some, but you just lost one

You might win some, but you just lost one
You might win some, but you just lost one
You might win some, but you just lost one
You might win some, but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from (Gain from)
What you done done? It's so silly, how come?
(You done, how come?)
You just lost one

Now don't you understand, man, universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
'Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard
You can't hold God's people back that long
The chain of Shaitan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have ‘til it's gone
Now even when you're gone, you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
'Cause you might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you just lost one
You might win some, but you just lost one
You might win some, but you just lost one
You might win some, but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done? It's so silly, how come?
You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly, how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done? It's so silly, how come?
You just lost one

You just lost one, you just lost one
You just lost one, you just lost one
(How come, you lost one? It's so dumb)
You just lost one, you just lost one
You just lost one
What a bam-bam!... hehehe

After winter must come spring (Must come spring)
Change, it comes eventually
Everything is everything
What is meant to be will be

After winter must come spring (Must come)
Change, it comes eventually

I wrote these words (I wrote these words) for everyone who struggles in their youth

Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist (Word)

Flipping in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You can't match this rapper slash actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti (Ooh, uh)
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister Betty (El Shabazz!)
L-Boogie spars with stars and constellations (What?)
Then came down for a little conversation (Huh)
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum (What?)
Now hear this mixture, where Hip Hop meets scripture (Uh)
Develop a negative into a positive picture

Now everything is everything (Everything, y'all, everything, y'all)
What is meant to be will be (What is meant to be will be, yeah)
After winter must come spring (After winter, must come spring)
Change, it comes eventually (Change, it comes eventually)

Sometimes it seems we'll touch that dream (Sometimes it seems we'll touch that dream)
But things come slow or not at all (They come slow, know what I mean?)
And the ones on top won't make it stop (Ones on top, they won't make it stop)
So convinced that they might fall
Let's love ourselves and we can't fail
To make a better situation (Better situation, uh-uh)
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow (Tomorrow, our seeds will grow)
All we need is dedication
Let me tell ya that

Everything is everything

===== Lauryn Hill - I Used to Love Him =====
Now, I don't
I used to love him, now I don't
Now, I don't

As I look at what I've done (What I've done)
The type of life that I've lived (Life that I've lived)
How many things I pray the father will forgive
One situation (Situation, uh-uh)  involved a young man
He was the ocean (Uh-uh) and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses and blurried my sight
And I used to love him

I used to love him, but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him, but now I don't
Now I don't

I chose the road of passion and pain (Passion and pain)
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power; ceased being queen
Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
See, torn and confused, wasted and used
Reached the crossroad, which path would I choose?
Stuck and frustrated, I waited, debated
For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no then I just should have heeded
Misled, I bled 'til the poison was gone
And, out of the darkness, arrived the sweet dawn

Now I don't
I used to love him, but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him, but now I don't
Now I don't

Father you saved me and you showed me that life
Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans
See, my soul was weary, but now it's replenished
Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold, see, I took back my soul
And totally let my creator control
The life which was his, the life which was his to begin with

Now I don't
I used to love him, but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him, but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him, but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him, but now I don't
Now I don't

I used to love him, but now I don't
I used to love him, but now I don't
I used to love him, but now I don't
See, I used to love him

===== Lauryn Hill - I Gotta Find Peace of Mind =====
I gotta find peace of mind
I know another cord...
I gotta find peace of mind
See, this what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind
I gotta find peace of mind, I gotta find peace of mind

He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible
He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible

He says there's no me without him
Please help me forget about him
He takes all my energy, trapped in my memory
Constantly holding me, constantly holdin' me
I need to tell you all, all the pain he's caused, mm-mm-mm-mm
I need to tell you I'm
I'm undone because, mm-mm-mm-mm

He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible
He says it's impossible without him, but I know it's possible

To finally be in love, and know the real meaning of
A lasting relationship, not based on ownership
I trust every part of You, 'cause all that I...
All that you say you do
You love me despite myself, sometimes I fight myself
I just can't believe that you, would have anything to do
With someone so insecure, someone so immature
Oh, you inspire me, to be the higher me

You make my desire pure, you make my desire pure
Just tell me what to say, I can't find the words to say
Please don't be mad with me, I have no identity
All that I've known is gone, all I was building on
I wanna walk with you, how do I talk to you

Touch my mouth with your hands
Touch my mouth with your hands
Oh I wanna understand, the meaning of your embrace
I know now I have to face the temptations of my past
Please don't let me disgrace, will my devotion last?
Now that I know the truth, now that it's no excuse

Keeping me from your love, what was I thinking of?
Holding me from your love, what was I thinking of?
You are my peace of mind, that old me is left behind
You are my peace of mind, that old me is left behind

He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible
He says it's improbable, but I know it's tangible
He says it's not grab-able, but I know it's have-able
'Cause anything's possible, oh anything is possible
Please come free my mind, please come meet my mind
Can you see my mind? Oh
Won't you come free my mind?
Oh, I know it's possible
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything, yeah
Anything, anything, anything, anything, yeah
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything, yeah
Oh free! Free, free, free your mind
Free, free your mind... free, free your mind
Free, free, free, free your mind
Oh, it's so possible, oh it's so possible
I'm telling you it's possible, I'm telling you it's possible
Free, free... free, free... free, free... get free now
Free, free... free, free, free, free... free, free

You're my peace of mind, that old me is left behind
You're my peace of mind, you're my peace of mind
He's my peace of mind, he's my peace of mind
He's my peace of mind, he's my peace of mind

What a joy it is to be alive
To get another chance, yeah
Everyday's another chance
To get it right this time
Everyday's another chance
Oh what a merciful, merciful, merciful God
Oh what a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful God

I loved real, real hard once
But the love wasn't returned
Found out the man I'd die for
He wasn't even concerned
I tried, and I tried, and I tried
To keep him in my life (To keep him in my life)
I cried, and I cried, and I cried
But I couldn't make it right

But I, I loved the young man
And if you ever been in love
Then you'd understand

That what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it
If you don't catch it, if you don't catch it
And what you need ironically (Ironically)
Will turn out what you want to be (What you want to be)
If you just let it (if you just let it)
If you just let it (if you just let it)

See, I thought this feeling, it was all that I had
But how could this be love
And make me feel so bad? (Gave up my power)
Gave up my power, I existed for you
But whoever knew, the voodoo you'd do

But I, I loved the young man (Uh-huh)
And if you ever been in love
Then you'd understand

That what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it (If you don't— if you don't—)
(If you don't— if you don't—)
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it (If you don't— if you don't—)

See what you want might make you cry (If you don't— if you don't—)

You ain't said nothin'
Why you ain't say somethin' to me?
I feel like love right now is like confusion
It's like people think they love somebody
When they don't really love somebody
Like I thought I was in love with this girl, but I really wasn't
It's like now, I don't feel about her
Ok
Alright
You think that TV and music have somethin' to do with
Why people are always confused about love?
Yes!
Why?
'Cause today we listen to a lot of TV a lot of music
And it sounds nice, but it may not always be right for you
We need to put you on a bullhorn
Let you ride around Newark

===== Lauryn Hill - Superstar =====
Yo hip-hop, started out in the heart
Uh-huh, yo
Now everybody tryin' to chart
Say what? Hip-hop, started out in the heart
Yo, now everybody tryin' to chart
C'mon now, baby, c'mon now, baby, c'mon now, baby, c'mon, uhh
C'mon now, baby, c'mon now, baby, c'mon now, baby, c'mon

C'mon, baby, light my fire (Come on)
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything)
Music is supposed to inspire (Music is supposed to inspire)
How come we ain't gettin' no higher? (How come, how come)

Now, tell me your philosophy
On exactly what an artist should be
Should they be someone with prosperity
And no concept of reality?

Now, who you know without any flaws
That lives above the spiritual laws?
And does anything they feel just because (Just because, just because)
There's always someone there who'll applaud?

C'mon baby light my fire (Come on)
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything you drop is so tired)
Music is supposed to inspire (What are we here for? What are we here for?)
How come we ain't gettin' no higher? (Gettin' no higher)

I know you think that you've got it all
And by making other people feel small
Makes you think you're unable to fall
But when you do, who you gonna call?

See, what you give is just what you get (What you give is just what you get)
I know it hasn't hit you yet (I know it hasn't hit you yet)
Now, I don't mean to get you upset (Get upset, get upset)
But every cause has an effect, uh-huh

C'mon, baby, light my fire (Yeah)
Everything you drop is so tired (Yeah)
Music is supposed to inspire (Music is supposed to inspire)
So, how come we ain't gettin' no higher? (We ain't no higher, we ain't no higher)

I cross sands in distant lands, made plans with the sheiks
Why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak? Uhh
All I wanted was to sell like five hundred
And be a ghetto superstar since my first album, Blunted
I used to work at Foot Locker, they fired me: I fronted
Or I quitted, now I spit it, however do you want it?
Now you get it!
Writing rhymes, in the Range, with the frames lightly tinted
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemented (Lauryn Hill!)
And if your lines sound like mine I'm taking a percentage (ka-ching!)
Unprecedented, and still respected when it's vintage
I'm serious, I'm takin' over areas in Aquarius
Runnin' red lights with my ten thousand chariots
Just as Christ was a Superstar, you stupid, star!
They'll hail you then nail you, no matter who you are
They'll make you now then take you down, and make you face it
If you slit the bag open, put your pinky in it and taste it

C'mon, baby, light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything you drop, everything you drop)
Music is supposed to inspire (Oh yeah)
How come we ain't gettin no higher? (We ain't getting no higher, getting no higher)
C'mon, baby, light my fire (C'mon baby light my fire)
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything you drop is so tired)
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we ain't gettin no higher? (How come we ain't gettin no higher?)
C'mon, baby, light my fire (Come on baby)
Everything you drop is so tired (Everything you drop is so tired)
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we ain't gettin no higher? (We ain't no higher)

===== Lauryn Hill - Forgive Them Father =====
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us
Although them again we will never, never, never trust
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Them nuh know what them do
Dig out your eye, while I'm sticking like glue
Fling, skin, grin, while them plotting for you, true!

Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do (Me a tell you, dem nuh know)
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do (Fi be real, them nuh have a clue!)

Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you
To you
They say all the right things to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do
Oh

Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do

Why every Indian wanna be the chief?
Feed a man 'til he full and he still want beef
Give me grief, try to tief off my piece
Why for you to increase, I must decrease?
If I treat you kindly, does it mean that I'm weak?
You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized, like Menelik
And other African czars, observing stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you can't list them
How you gon' idolize the missing? To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they coming, gunning, I stand position
L known the mission since conception
Let's free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers, then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle?
March through these streets like Soweto, uhh

Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus
Jesus and Judas, backstabbers do this

Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do

It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves
A friend once said, and I found to be true
That everyday people, they lie to God too
So, what makes you think, that they won't lie to you?

Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do (Forgive them, forgive them)
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do (Forgive them, forgive them)

Gwan like dem love you, while dem rip you to shreds
Trample pon yuh heart, and leff you fi dead
Dem a yuh friend, who you depend pon, from way back when
( to grace)
But if you, gi' dem yuh back, then you must meet yuh end
Dem nuh know what dem do do
(Who's gonna be the one?)
Dem nuh know what dem do do
(Gotta be the one to say)
Dem nuh know, dem nuh know, dem nuh know, dem nuh know
Dem nuh know what dem do do
(Oh, yeah, oh)

(Forgive them, Father, forgive them, Father...)

What do you think?
It's just happenin', like things just become annoying and then like twenty-four-seven thinkin' about the girl and stuff like that and then you like— if you do somethin' wrong, you like, oh, does she hate me, right? You wanna know what they're thinkin'
Yeah, yeah
So, what— what she feels— hold! What she feels is important to you?
Right
Huh? Why?
Because... I want her to still love me, but, you know, but— see, but, I know she still like me 'cause, you know, a little eye contact. 'Cause I don't want her no more, but—
Alright, you talkin' 'bout somebody, you love somebody

===== Lauryn Hill - Final Hour =====
Uh-uh
Uh
And yo
Uhh, uhh (Like fungus among us)
Yo, yo (Haha), uh

Yo, I treat this like my thesis
Well-written topic, broken down into pieces
I introduce then produce, words so profuse
It's abuse how I juice up this beat, like I'm deuce
Two people both equal like I'm Gemini, rather Simeon
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it, you can't stop it
Drop it, your whole crew microscopic
Like particles while I make international articles, and on the cover
Don't discuss the baby mother (Nah)
Business, I been in this third LP you can't tell me
I witness first-handed, I'm candid, you can't stand it
Respect demanded, and get flown around the planet
Rock Hard like granite or steel
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel
And this is real, so I keep makin' the street's ballads
While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad

You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour

I'm about to change the focus from the richest to the brokest
I wrote this opus, to reverse the hypnosis
Whoever's closest to the line's gonna win it
You gonna fall trying to ball while my team win the pennant
I'm about to begin it, for a minute, then run for senate
Make a slum lord be repentant, give his money to kids to spend it
And then amend it, every law that ever prevented
Our survival since our arrival documented in The Bible
Like Moses and Aaron, things gon' change, it's apparent
And all the transparent gonna be seen through
Let God redeem you, keep your deen true, you can get the green too
Watch out what you cling to, observe how a queen do
And I remain calm reading the 73rd Psalm
'Cause with all that’s going on I got the world in my palm

You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour

Now I be breaking bread sipping Manischewitz wine
Pay no mind, party like it's 1999
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind
Now I'ma get the mozzarella like a Rockafeller
Still be in the church of Lalibela, singing hymns a cappella
Whether posed in Mirabella in Couture
Or collecting residuals from off The Score
I'm making sure I'm with the 144
I've been here before this ain't a battle, this is war
Word to Boonie, I make salat like a Sunni
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community
Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hood-chic
But it ain't what you cop, it's about what you keep
And even if there are leaks, you can't capsize this ship
'Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip

You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour

===== Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill =====
My world, it moves so fast today
The past, it seems so far away
And life squeezes so tight that I can't breathe
And every time I've tried to be what someone else has thought of me
So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve

But deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny

I look at my environment
And wonder where the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be
I hear so many cry for help
Searching outside of themselves
Now I know that His strength is within me

And deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny (And deep in my heart)
And deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny

===== Lauryn Hill - Every Ghetto, Every City =====
I was just a little girl
Skinny legs, a press and curl
My mother always thought I'd be a star
But way before the record deals
Streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill
Made sure that I'd never go too far

Every ghetto, every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days, in New Jerusalem

Story starts in Hootaville
Grew up next to Ivy Hill
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun
"Kill the Guy" in Carter Park
Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark
Watching kids show off the stolen ones

Every ghetto, every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days, in the New Jerusalem

You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back.. looking back, looking back, looking back
You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back

Bag of Bontons, twenty cents and a nickel (well that's a quarter)
Springfield Ave. had the best popsicles
Saturday morning cartoons and Kung-Fu (wuh-TAH!)
Main street roots tonic with the dreads
A beef patty and some coco bread
Move the patch from my Lee's to the tongue of my shoes
'Member, Freling-Huysen used to have the bomb leather
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick was together
Looking at the crew, we thought we'd all live forever

You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back
You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back

Drill teams on Munn street
'Member when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef
Moving Records was on Central Ave
I was there at dancing school
South Orange Ave. at Borlin pool
Unaware of what we didn't have
Writing my friends' names on my jeans with a marker
July 4th races outside Parker
Fireworks at Martin Stadium
The Untouchable P.S.P
Where all them crazy niggas be
And car thieves got away through Irvington (skrrrt, lock it up, uh)
Hillside brings beef with the cops
Self Destruction record drops
And everybody's name was Muslim (children playing, women producing)
Sensations and eighty-eight
Attracted kids from out of state
And everybody used to do the wop (wop it out, wop it out, wop it out)
Jack ya, jack ya, jack ya body
Nah, the BizMark used to amp up the party
I wish those days, they didn't stop

Every ghetto, every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days, in New Jerusalem

You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back
You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back
You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back

Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back

Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me, yeah
It's a new dawn, it's a new day

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel

===== Lauryn Hill - Mr. Intentional =====
Let's just warm up a little bit
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, mmm
Yeah
Yeah

See, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions
Can't you tell, the way they have to mention
How they helped you out? You're such a hopeless victim
Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional

All their talk is seasoned to perfection
The road they walk, commanding your affection
They need to be needed, deceived by motivation
An opportunity to further situation
Why they're so important is without explanation
Please don't patronize me, Mr. Intentional
Oh, oh, oh

We give rise to ego by being insecure
The advice that we go desperately searching for
The subconscious effort to support our paramour
To engage in denial, to admit we're immature
Validating lies, Mr. Intentional
Open up your eyes, Mr. Intentional

Stuck in a system that seeks to suck your blood
Held emotionally hostage by what everybody does
Counting all the money that you give them just because
Exploiting ignorance in the name of love
Stop before you drop because that's just the way it was
Please don't justify me, Mr. Intentional
Oh, one-dimensional
Mr. Intentional
Oh, oh, don't you do me any favors
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Wake up, you've been sleeping
Take up your bed and walk
Stop blaming other people
Oh, it's nobody else's fault
Accept the truth about you
You know that life goes on without you
And your expensive misinventions
Disguising your intentions
Don't worship my hurt feelings, Mr. Intentional, oh, oh, oh

See, I know you can't help me, Mr. Intentional
The only help I need to live is unprofessional
The only wealth I have to give is not material
And if you need much more than that, I'm not available
Please don't entertain me, Mr. Intentional
Oh, I don't need your sympathy, Mr. Intentional
Stay away from me, Mr. Intentional

So one-dimensional
Mr. Promotional
Mr. Emotional
Mr. Intentional
Oh, oh
Oh
This is the part of the show where the bracelet comes off
You try to be cute, but—
Uh

===== Lauryn Hill - I Get Out =====
I get out, I'll get out of all your boxes
I get out, you can't hold me in these chains
I'll get out, Father free me from this bondage
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must change

Your stinking resolution is no type of solution
Preventing me from freedom, maintaining your pollution
I won't support your lie no more
I won't even try no more
If I have to die, oh Lord, that's how I choose to live
I won't be compromised no more
I can't be victimized no more
I just don't sympathize no more, ‘cause now I understand
You just wanna use me
You say "love" then abuse me
You never thought you'd lose me
But how quickly we forget that nothin' is for certain
You thought I'd stay here hurtin'
Your guilt trip's just not workin', repressin' me to death
‘Cause now I'm choosin' life, yo
I'll take the sacrifice, yo
If everything must go, then go: that's how I choose to live

Heh… hehehehehe…
Ok, we gettin' there
At least I had a chunk
Aight, okay, it's how I choose to live
Hehehe, awww

No more compromises
I see past your disguises
Blinding me through mind control
Stealing my eternal soul
Appealing through material
To keep me as your slave

But I get out, oh, I get out of all your boxes
I'll get out, oh, you can't hold me in these chains
I get out, oh, I want out of social bondage
Knowin' my condition, oh, is the reason I must change

See, what you see is what you get
Oh, and you ain't seen nothin' yet
Oh, I don't care if you're upset
I could care less if you're upset
See, it don't change the truth
And your hurt feeling's no excuse
To keep me in this box
Psychological locks
Repressin' true expression
Cementin' this repression
Promotin' mass deception
So that no one can be healed
I don't respect your system
I won't protect your system
When you talk I don't listen
Oh, let my Father's will be done

And just get out, oh, just get out of all these bondage
Just get out, oh, you can't hold me in these chains
Just get out, all these traditions killin' freedom
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must change

I've just accepted what you said
Keeping me among the dead
The only way to know
Is to walk to learn and grow
But faith is not your speed
Oh, you’d have everyone believe
That you're the sole authority
Just follow the majority
Afraid to face reality—the system is a joke
Oh, you'd be smart to save your soul
Oh, and escape this mind control
You spent your life in sacrifice to a system for the dead
Oh, are you sure, where is the passion in this living?
Are you sure it's God you serving?
Obligated to a system
Getting less then you're deserving
Who made up these schools, I say
Who made up these rules, I say
Animal conditioning
Oh, just to keep us as a slave

Oh, just get out of this social purgatory
Just get out, all these traditions are a lie
Just get out, superstition killin' freedom
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must die

Just get out, just get out, just get out
Let's get out, let's get out
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must die
Just get out

We hide the parts of ourselves we don't want the world to see
We lock them away
We tell them no
We banish them
But here, we don't
Welcome to MONTERO

===== Lil Nas X - THATS WHAT I WANT =====
One, two, three, four

Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah, we did it before, but we'll do it tonight
That afro, black boy with the gold teeth
He dark skin, lookin' at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, he comin' over to me, yeah

These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

I want someonе to love me
I need someonе who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me and my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want

Look, you know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothin' but love on my mind (My mind)
I need a baby while I'm in my prime
Need an adversary to my "down and weary"
Like, tell me "That's life" when I'm stressin' at night
Be like, "You'll be okay" and, "Everything is alright," uh
Let me in that thing, 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But you're loving your body and a little bit of your brain

These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

I want someone to love me
I need someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me and my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want

I want someone to love me
I need someone who needs me

'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me and my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want

On a mission to get high up, I know that I'ma die
Reachin' for a life that I don't really need at all
Never listened to replies, learned a lesson from the wise

Th-These niggas don't like me, they don't like me
Likely, they wanna fight me
Come on, try it out, try me
They put me down, but I never cried out, "Why me?"
Word from the wise, don't put worth inside a nigga that ain't try

===== Lil Nas X - SUN GOES DOWN =====
I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun

You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh)
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dyin'
Over your past mistakes (Oh)
And people who threw dirt on your name

Since ten, I been feelin' lonely
Had friends, but they was pickin' on me
Always thinkin', "Why my lips so big?
Was I too dark? Can they sense my fears?"
These gay thoughts would always haunt me
I prayed God would take it from me
It's hard for you when you're fightin'
And nobody knows it when you're silent
I'd be by the phone
Stanning Nicki mornin' into dawn
Only place I felt like I belonged
Strangers make you feel so loved, you know?
And I'm happy by the way
That I made that jump, that leap of faith
I'm happy that it all worked out for me
I'ma make my fans so proud of me, oh

I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun

You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh)
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dying
Over your past mistakes (Oh)
And people who threw dirt on your name

And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain

Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers, "Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him"
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher
Motherfucker, I'm ill

A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derrière
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me

He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!

Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch, haha
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

Motherfucker, I'm ill

See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac

Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour, haha
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say "Life ain't shit without me"
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, 'cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me
I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat

===== Lil Wayne - Mirror =====
Uh, with everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going, but
You think that ya on your way
Life lined up on the mirror, don't blow it

Woah, look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the

Mirror on the wall (Woah)
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall (Uh)
You've been my only friend (Yeah)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the

Mirror on the wall
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall (Uh-huh)
You've been my only friend (My only friend)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am (They can't understand)
So why are we here (Misunderstood)
Talking to each other again? (Woah)

Looking at me now, I can see my past
Damn, I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in a broken mirror
I see my mama smile, that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message could've been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the

Mirror on the wall (MJ taught me that)
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall (Uh)
You've been my only friend (Take 'em to Mars, man)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we
Talking to each other again? (Uh)
Mirror on the wall (Woah)
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend (Any questions?)
You told me that they can (I come to you)
Understand the man I am (You always have the answer)
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

Mirror on the wall
Hey B.P, looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time
So why are we
Talking to each other again?

===== Lil Wayne - 6 Foot 7 Foot =====
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

Ahem
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish, ha!

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch (Yeah)
Six-six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch (I'm goin' back in)

Okay
I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money... uh
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag, you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Yeah, word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I-I play the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler, Wayne
These niggas out they mind, I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind, tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love, keep throwin' my sign
In the middle, hit 'em up, piece on my side, ‘cause ain't no peace on my side
Bitch, I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga
Ya heard? Gunna

===== Lil Wayne - She Will =====
(Young Money)
(Yeah, four)
(Ahem)

I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention, but attention paid me
Haters can't see me, nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real"
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel"
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now, she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now, she will, she will, she will, uh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now, she will, she will, she will (Uh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now, she will
(Yeah)

I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for me"
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that whine 'n' dine
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, "Choose wisely," that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split (Aha)

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real"
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel"

And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel" (Feelin' like the sky is opening, and I am entering, yeah)
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal (Uh, feelin' like like the world is falling and I am rising, alright, well alright, well alright, woo)
And she bad, so maybe she won't, uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah (Carter IV, baby, alright, well alright, well alright, uh, Tunechi)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now, she will, yeah (Alright, well alright, well alright)

===== Lil Wayne - How To Love =====
Cut the music up
A little louder, yeah

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, mm
For a second you were here (Hey), now you over there (Hey, hey)
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love (Ayy), never had a love (Ayy)

When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly, it's like a blessin'
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sittin' here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, ah, how to love, mm
For a second you were here (Hey), now you over there (Hey)
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body (Hey)
Like you never had a love (Ayy), uh, had a love (Ayy)

Oh, and you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listenin', but
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartendin' and strippin', baby
So don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You seen a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, oh

See, I just want you to know
That you deserve the best, you're beautiful (Ayy)
You're beautiful (Ayy), yeah
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual (Ayy), far from the usual (Ayy)

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, mm
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, mm
See, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love, yeah
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, mm

Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused

We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in two's
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole

And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train
Yes I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jessie James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig

Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at

===== Lil Wayne - Scared of the Dark =====
I'm not scared of the dark
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
I'm not scared, not at all
Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?
I'm not scared
I'm not scared, neither are the stars
I'm not scared of the dark
Of the dark, mmm

Tunechi
I ain't never scared and I ain't never horrified
I just look down at my Rolex, it said it's the darkest times
I ain't never terrified, I ain't never petrified
You know I see dead people, I just tell 'em get a life
I ain't never scurred, I'm not sure if that's a word, but
I meant every word, feelin' like do not disturb, wait
Let me testify, I have never testified
And I'm married to my pride, I ain't never— the bride
I got eyes like marbles, if I cry, they sparkle
You know I can read your mind like I'm the author
There's a line for tomorrow and that line's gettin' shorter
I'm behind the trigger, what if I am the target?
Deep sigh, a sayōnara, I ain't afraid to die
It's either goodbye or good mornin', and the skies start to fallin'
And I'ma shine in the darkness
I look back down at my Rollie, it says time for the chorus
You know I'm not scared

I'm not scared of the dark
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared, not at all

Why would a star, a star ever be afraid of the dark?

I'm not scared, neither are the stars
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared of the dark

Of the dark, mmm
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yuh
Okay, put my heart to the side
In my feelings, ****, let's ride
Big MAC to the side
If she call, I'm gon' slide
That my baby, boy, you crazy
She might get a new Mercedes
She say she want me, ooh-wee
Okay, lil' shawty, let's do this, uh-huh

If I could count the tears I've cried
So many times, I swear I've died
I'm trying, but it's still not right
The only time I want her is night

I'm not scared of the dark
(I ain't never scared, I ain't never scared)
I'm not running, running, running
No, I'm not afraid of the fall
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm not scared, not at all

===== Lil Wayne - Mona Lisa =====
I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get him," she say, "I got you"
I say, "No, bitch, I said get him" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothing, keep resting,"
She say, "What's missing?"—"How you know something missing?"
He scratched his head, she say, "Get back in bed,"
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, "Ooh"

I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we following
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,"
And if he say yeah, then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share, I

Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told you"
She gave me a salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier!"
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona

Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself

She say, "Ooh, daddy, ooh,"
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, "Ooh," dead emotion (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah

(Weezy, Weezy, Weezy, Weezy
Weezy, Weezy, Weezy, Weezy)
I see, thank you man, thank you
Y'all know his name
Ayo, Mack, let the beat drop
Ladies and gentlemen, C5, Wayne time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Zone, zone, zone, zone, zone
Let me see your shoulders work
I mean, I don't know what y'all came here to do, but, uh
If you ain't got a lighter, what the fuck you smoking for?
We hot! (Haaa)

What the fuck, though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough guy, that's enough jokes
Then the sun die, the night is young though
The diamonds still shine in the rough, ho
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, where the ones go?
It's a shit show, put you front row
Talkin' shit, bro? Let your tongue show
Money over bitches, and above hoes
That is still my favorite love quote
Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore
What the fuck, yo? Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go
If she's iffy, there the drugs go
If she sip lean, double-cup toast
I got a duffle full of hundos
There the love go, where's the uproar?

What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
I come out the scuffle without a scuff, woah
Puff, puff, bro; I don't huff though
Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke
At your front door with a gun stowed
"Knock, knock!" "Who's there?" is how it won't go
This the jungle, so have the utmost
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so
What the fuck, bro? It's where I'm from, bro
We grow up fast, we roll up slow
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow (Woo!)
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald
What the fuck, bro? Where the love go? (Oh!)
Swizzy, he the chef, I like my lunch gross (Goddamn!)
Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go? (Talk to 'em, Weezy!)
Hmm, to the unknown
Only way he comin' back is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?

What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo

===== Lil Wayne - Drop the World =====
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, ma'fucker
‘Cause all this bullshit just made me strong, ma'fucker

So I pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

Uh
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I, I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I could pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Haha, yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
I'm gone

It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream: "Fuck 'em all!"

Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Oops, time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another, I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—

Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
I'm gone

===== Lil Wayne - Rich As Fuck =====
Ugh, AK on my nightstand, right next to that Bible
But I swear, with these fifty shots, I'll shoot it out with Five-O
Pockets gettin' too fat, no Weight Watchers, no lipo
Money talks, bullshit walks on a motherfucking tightrope
And I make that pussy tap out, I knock that pussy out cold
Nigga, you get beat the crap out, but that's just how the dice roll
These hoes want that hose-pipe, so I give all these hoes pipe
She get on that dick and stay on, all night, like porch lights
Let's do it, fuck talking, we out here, we ballin'
And I'm spraying at these rusty niggas like WD-40
We fucked up, we Truk'd up; no if, ands, or butt-fucks
Bitch niggas go behind your back like nunchucks, and that's fucked up
But my hoes down, my cups up, my niggas down for whatever
These bitches think they're too fly, well, tell them hoes I pluck feathers
I'm Tunechi, Young Tunechi, I wear Trukfit, fuck Gucci
She blowing kisses at me with her pussy lips, smooches

Ugh, never talk to the cops, I don't speak Pig Latin

Tell the bitches that be hatin' I ain't got no worries
I just want to hit and run like I ain't got insurance, ho
What's your name? What's your sign? Zodiac Killer
All rats gotta die, even Master Splinter
Yeah, murder, one-eighty-seven
I be killing them bitches, I hope all dogs go to heaven
And I got Xanax, Percocet, promethazine with codeine
Call me Mr. Sandman, I'm sellin' all these hoes dreams
Got a white girl with big titties, flat-ass, TV screen
I keep a bad bitch, call me "The B.B. King"
And you know I got that mouth out her
Then put that bitch out like a house fire
I'm killing these hoes like Michael Myers
I eat that cat just like a lion
And I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
And I see your girl when I want
I got that ho TiVo'd, ugh
Got a red-ass bitch with a red-ass pussy
Nigga try me, that's a dead-ass pussy
Since y'all motherfuckers so blind to the fact
To tell you the truth, I don't care who's lookin'
All I know is I love my bitch
And pussy feel just like Heaven on Earth
Six feet deep, dick shovelin' the dirt
RIP: Rest In Pussy
Light that shit, then pass that shit, we gon' get so smoked out
And then I went, got locked up; every night, I dreamt I broke out
One time for them pussy niggas—that's that shit I don't like
We eatin' over here, nigga—fuck around and have a food fight
And that's 2 Chainz

Look at you (Uh), now look at us (Yeah)
All my niggas look rich as fuck (What?)
All my niggas live rich as fuck (What?)

While I make us a drink, and I don't drink
So when you're not lookin' I pour some out in the sink

And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

Runnin' down the court I'm dunkin' on 'em, Lisa Leslie
It-it-it-it-it's goin' down, basement
Friday the 13th, guess who's playing Jason
Tuck yourself in, you better hold onto your teddy
It's Nightmare on Elm Street and guess who's playin' Freddy

She slides down the pole, like a certified stripper
When we all alone, I might just tip her
She slides down the pole, like a certified stripper, I kinda like that

Tell me whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
Boy, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!

Talkin' about gats, traps, cops and robbers
It's 9-1-1, please call the doctor!
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
Since everybody wanna piece, we gon' split ya wigs
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries
You about to catch a cold, stay the fuck around me!
Ya peeps talkin' 'bout "What kinda shit's he on?"
You disappear like "Poof, bitch be gone!"
You think twelve gon' catch me? Gimme a break!
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plates
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimme some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof, wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, Golden Grain in the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
We go front, back and side to side, what?!

Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
Tell me whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
If you 'bout to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!

Let's take it to the streets 'cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With my pedal to the floor, radar in the grill
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday, so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection
'Cause the women love the paint and they can see they reflection
I'm about to take off, so F what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
And for the fools, we gon' clock one and we'll pop one
'Cause my folk ridin' shotgun with a shotgun

You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them girls up the block still runnin' they mouth
Boy, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
If anyone talk bad about the Dirty South
Tell me what I'm gon' do? Act a fool!

I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the street still smokin'
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
On the off-ramp, doin' about a hundred and fifty
Rollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin' shit
I even got a trailer hitch with a barbeque pit
And now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire, 'cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees in Vs that's fantastic
So girls, hold ya weave while I'm weavin' through traffic
I kick to fifth gear and tear the road apart
You'll be like lil John Q and get a Change of Heart
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens!

The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Man, that ain't sticky, that's sticks and stems!
Boy, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
Catch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed
Ladies, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!
If the bottle's all gone and your eyes are red
Boy, whatchu gon' do? Act a fool!

2 Fast (2 Fast), 2 Furious (2 Furious)
2 Fast, act a fool!
2 Fast (2 Fast), 2 Furious (2 Furious)
2 Fast, act a fool!

===== Ludacris - What's Your Fantasy =====
45 ContributorsWhat’s Your Fantasy Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to me now, give it to me now
Give it to me now

I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah, ah," you make it so good, I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah, ah," you make it so good, I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the 50-yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree
And if you like in the club, we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked, don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots, so they got to wait 'til the show stop
Or how about on the beach with black sand?
Lick up your thigh, then call me "the Pac-Man"
Tabletop or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park, to the Point, to the Flatlands
That man named Ludacris (Woo!) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it, Lova Lova gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I passed 'em
Get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and outlast 'em
And if it ain't good, then I trash 'em
While you stash 'em, I'll let 'em free
And they tell me what's they fantasy
Like up on the roof, roof
Tell your boyfriend not to be mad at me

I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah, ah," you make it so good, I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah, ah," you make it so good, I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

I wanna get you in the bathtub with the candles lit
You give it up 'til they go out
Or we can do it on stage at the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know it got sold out
A red carpet dick, it just roll out
Go ahead and scream, you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain, running the train
When it's hot or when it's cold out
How about in the library on top of books?
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign
Let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name?
The sauna, jacuzzi, in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in the middle of the barn
Rose petals on the silk sheets, uh
Eating fresh fruit, sweep your woman right off her feet

I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah, ah," you make it so good, I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah, ah," you make it so good, I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

I wanna get you in the back seat, windows up
That's the way you like to fuck
Clogged up, fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex, make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown, that's the way that I like it twerked
Legs jerk, overworked
Underpaid, but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team, off the ropes
On the ocean or in the boat
Factories or one hundred spokes
What about up in the candy store?
That chocolate, chocolate, make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs
Smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream "Help," play my game
Dracula, man, I'll get my fangs
Horseback, and I'll get my reins
School teacher, let me get my brains

I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah, ah," you make it so good, I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, "Ah, ah," you make it so good, I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

===== Ludacris - How Low =====
44 ContributorsHow Low Lyrics
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
Hahaha, Luda!

She can go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans
Baby, pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it better than I've ever seen I done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground, but how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined it, not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror, now you doing it on the dance floor
Mad 'cause I can't get with you, chick, just show me how to dance, oh
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up, kinda like a player do
But if you come to the crib, then I might show you girls a thing or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Before you make it big, there's just one thing that I gotta know

How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?

I can go low (Go low), lower than you know
I can go low (Go low), l-l-l-lower than you know
I can go low (Go low), l-l-l-lower than you know
I can go low (Go low), l-l-l-lower than you know

I be like knick, knack, patty, wack, oh, where my kitty cat? Give a dog a bone
How many licks does it take 'til I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home?
I can make this show stop, soon as he hear this fo' pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to yo' block
Put the needle on the record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really get low, then I'ma shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla (French vanilla) and the caramel (And the caramel)
But when it comes to chocolate (when it comes to chocolate), I know that very well
Asian persuasion, no discrimination, I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butter Rican pecan peanut butter cups like Reese's Pieces
'Cause I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Before you make it big, well, there's just one thing that I gotta know

How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?

I can go low (Go low), lower than you know
I can go low (Go low), l-l-l-lower than you know
I can go low (Go low), l-l-l-lower than you know
I can go low (Go low), l-l-l-lower than you know

Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
Don't stop, get it, get it
Put it in reverse just to back it up, let me put some Luda in it
Show me what you working with, I'll show you some of this bankroll
Yeah, you a superstar, there's just one thing I gotta know, so

How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?

I can go low (Go low), lower than you know
I can go low (Go low), l-l-l-lower than you know
I can go low (Go low), l-l-l-lower than you know
I can go low (Go low), l-l-l-lower than you know

But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got J.O. up on my right side pourin' some cups
My whole hood is to my left and they ain't givin a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you were saying today
But don't forget about this feeling that I am making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile-high points you earn when we taking my jet
And how everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet cause you can

Family off the street made my homies put the baggies back
Still stacking plaques, (Yep!) still action packed! (Yep!)
And dough? I keep it flipping like acrobats!
That's why I pack a mac, that'll crack 'em back
'Cause on my waist there's more Heat than the Shaq Attack
But I ain't speaking about ballin, ballin
Just thinking about brawlin' till y'all start bawlin'
We all in together now, birds of a feather now
Just bought a plane so we changing the weather now
So put your brakes on, caps put your capes on
Or knock off your block, get dropped and have your face flown

Sent him on his way 'cause I ain't for that talk!
No trips to the county, I ain't for that walk!

Put a DTP pendant at the end of yo' chain

Rollout, rollout
Rollout, rollout
Rollout, rollout
Rollout, rollout

(Rollout) I got my twin Glock .40's (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that
(Rollout) Twin Glock .40's (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that

Now, where'd you get that platinum chain with them diamonds in it?
Where'd you get that matchin' Benz with them windows tinted?
Who them girls you be with when you be ridin' through?
Man, I ain't got nothin' to prove, I paid my dues, breakin' the rules, I shake fools while I'm takin' a cruise
Tell me who's your weed man, and how do you smoke so good?
You's a superstar, boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that bag? What you got in that bag?
A couple of cans of whoop ass, you did a good-ass job of just eyein' me, spyin' me

(Rollout) I got my twin Glock .40's (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that

(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that

Man, that car don't come out until next year, where in the fuck did you get it?
That's eighty thousand bucks gone, where in the fuck did you spend it?
You must have eyes on your back 'cause you got money to the ceilin'
And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin', the better I'm feelin', the more that I'm chillin', winnin', drillin' and killin' the feelin'
Now, who's that bucked naked cook fixin' three course meals?
Gettin' goosebumps when her body taps the six inch heels
What in the world is in that room, what you got in that room?
A couple of gats, a couple of knives, a couple of rats, a couple of wives, now it's time to choose

(Rollout) I got my twin Glock .40's (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that
(Rollout) Twin Glock .40's (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that

Are you custom made, custom paid, or you just custom fitted?
PlayStation 2 up in the ride, is that Lorenzo-kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin' the hips, touchin' lips to the top of the dick and then, "Whew"
Now, tell me who's your housekeeper, and what you keep in your house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?
What in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate, wait to take place at a similar pace, so shake, shake it

(Rollout) I got my twin Glock .40's (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that
(Rollout) Twin Glock .40's (Rollout) cocked back
(Rollout) Me and my homies (Rollout), so drop that
(Rollout) We rollin' on twenties, (Rollout) with the top back
(Rollout) So much money (Rollout) you can't stop that

Get out my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business, ah
'Cause these niggas all up in my shit
And it's my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business
'Cause it's mine, oh, mine

Or 'til I'm stuck and my body feels weak weak weak weak..
Headed down to the Dungeon, wonderin, if they got some mooooore
And if they don't then I'mma haveta, settle fa, some 'droooooo
But it just ain't cool cause right on after, I'mma have-ta go
And continue on my mission fishin for the yum yum but I'm movin slowwww

Off this weed, and I'm full of that 'gnac 'gnac 'gnac 'gnac..
Get on in that stankin Lincoln, crank it up, and riiide

Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (it's that fire)
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (let's get higher)

===== Ludacris - Good Lovin =====
27 ContributorsGood Lovin Lyrics
I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout "that's supposed to be you, girl"

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need

I need some real good lovin'
'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

===== Ludacris - Rest Of My Life =====
35 ContributorsRest of My Life Lyrics
If you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter, a toast to life

Luda
They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death?
I'm on a journey, yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I got a feeling that I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher about to break some rules

That's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Oh, oh, oh

Na, na ,na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na na, na, hey
For the rest of my life

If I got one life to live, I'ma party 'til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth livin' if it's not on the edge?
Tryna keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say "Women, Weed, and Alcohol"

That's somewhere to go, but the world is movin' slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Oh, oh, oh

Na, na ,na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na, na, na, hey, oh
Na na, na, hey

If you live for somethin', you're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup (fill up your cup)
Lift your lighters, a toast to life

I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time
Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice
So I'm willin' to bet that I'ma be crazy for the rest of...

For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

43 ContributorsPimpin’ All Over the World Lyrics
(Oh yeah) The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

Sing it, hoes (The world, the world, the world)
All over the world, baby
It's only right that I share my experiences with y'all
Cause I've been places you'll never imagine (That's right)
But I'ma start it at home
When I see a girl I like, I walk straight up to them and I'm like

Uh, hey girl, how you doin'?
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
And I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name?
If you jot down ya number, you'll get mine in exchange, hey
See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me
We got people to meet and many places to see, hey
Mm, I'm really diggin' ya lips
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin' a crash
With your traffic jam booty, heads pausin' so fast, hey
I wouldn't trade you for the world, I swear it
I like ya hair and every style that you wear it
And how the colors coordinate with your clothes
From your manicured nails to your pedicured toes (Woo)

(Oh yeah) The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

Yeah, you hear the song so dance
Don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants
Um, cause see me, my pimpin's in 3D
I'm takin' you places you only see on TV
Tryna show ya how you livin' is trife
How many guys you know can bring the Travel Channel to life?
One day we on the Autobahn swervin', drivin'
Next day, we in the sun on the Virgin Islands
If you with me ain't no time to sleep
Especially at Wet Willie's on Miami Beach
But I drop you off and pay you no attention
If make it to Atlanta's Bronner Brothers convention
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Makin' sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard
Hawaii to D.C., it's plenty women to see
So if yo ass don't show up, it's more women for me, hey

(Oh yeah) The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican Day Parade
Then at night, I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the Jazz Fest
In Mardi Gras, all the women tryna show me they chest, ay
I'm in Jamaica spendin' massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin' me to mash it up
I had sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan, hey
I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago
Uh, oh yet and still
You wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil
(But where the best at?) Ain't no need of even askin' brah
The best women all reside in Africa, and that's real (Woo)

(Oh yeah) The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

Sing it, hoes (The world, the world, the world)

Pimpin' pimpin' pimpin'
Ladies and gentlemen as we ride out
Can we have all the real pimps
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air?
Now ladies, look around with me
Let's see if we can weed some of these niggas out
Cause it ain't no way that all these niggas could be pimpin'
Now if you happen to see a nigga
With two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga, "Put your hands down"
If you smell like you been at work all day and Drakkar
Please put your hands down
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
Please say, "Put your hands down"
If your spinnin' rims spin counterclockwise, you are not pimpin'
If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And there is not a woman in sight
Guess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin'
If your vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass, a-put your hands down
Now look down, look down
I need, I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time
Okay, you see the nigga with the white socks? Not pimpin'!
Sorry, unless you part of the Beat It entorauge
If your shoes have a buckle on 'em, you're not pimpin'

===== Ludacris - Growing Pains =====
38 ContributorsGrowing Pains Lyrics
Okay, I remember the days
High rights, low lefts, even stevens and fades
Troops, Lottos, and BKs, those was the days
Hi-tec boots spray painted witcha names
T-shirts airbrushed that read the same
Thick herringbone chain, one gold with yo' initial
Harris Photos, group shots, can you remember?
Barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
Didn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
When she disobeyed, had North Clayton crazed
Just to reiterate dog those was the days
Fo' the invasions of haters, man crews from all around
Used to get down at True Flavas, bumpin Kilo
Rockin Damage, Cross Colour and Paco
While playboys stepped in talent shows
Prom night, tux and Kangol was so cool
Fuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school)

We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids

In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown, Hamwood and Diplomats
Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats
We was lovin' that, before the Starter jacket jacks
For notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through
College Park after dark, Crown Victorias police unmarked cars
Be aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care
Kids was gettin stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin
Double dare ya touch shorty on the ass, that's a bet
Want your Kool-Aid and sugar, smack your hands and say "sweat"
It's mine now place it in my Louis Vuitton pouch
Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
Slouch socks, box Chevy Caprice
Hot Niss, cut da whole Disturbin' Tha Peace
Wit no conscience, broke niggas call 'em non cents
No comments, it's Lil' Fate payin homage to College Park

We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids

I had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back
With two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches
And set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
A child of the corn been wild since I was born
Climbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn
Shoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddies
I brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets
Dreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
And be with the people makin all that got damn noise, man

We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids
We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids

Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back (Like this)

Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she's about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and NEVER come back

Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!

Say shit and they be gettin' naked

It's your world and I'ma touch wherever you want me to touch it
Pop that, pop that and you'll be bustin' them nuts when you want to bust 'em
Don't rush it mama I'ma take my time and do it slow
From the car to the counter to the bed to the couch to the tub to the flo'
Oh! No! Could it be that a G really got you sprung?
I lost my count baby how many times did I make it cum?
Run, run, run from a nigga til you can't no more like Forrest Gump
Then it's more she gets, if it's more she wants
She's spoiled rotten like bad milk
Get her hot cause I make that ass melt
She whipped cause she love gettin' whipped in the whip
And I'ma black belt
I beat the pussy to pieces, never lettin' the cat off the leashes
And I'm goin' so deep they tellin' me all of they deepest and darkest secrets

I need party girls in my party world
Titties plastic, ass fantastic
They just brush my hair and touch me everywhere
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked, naked
Say shit and they be gettin' naked
I don't, I don't say shit and they be gettin' naked

Throw some ones on that
Get you wet as a waterpark I'ma have some fun with that
Make you come back to back you gon' bust like a gun with that
Like pow pow, brrr, pow pow, brrr
My bitch be gettin' down nigga how 'bout yours?
So turnt up when we in the club we don't even need a molly
Doin' so much over in this corner thought we was fuckin' in the party
My lung's filled with Marley
My hands on your body
And I'm goin' so deep I'm just lettin' you know that this me I got your face all in the pillow
You can't speak

I need party girls in my party world
Titties plastic, ass fantastic
They just brush my hair and touch me everywhere

Aw yeah, yeah
I mean there's a lot of women out here that's just, you know
They just deficient in so many things, man
You missing so many key nutrients in your life
I, I just want you to stay healthy in these streets
Oh, no no
Somebody gotta give you some vitamin D, you know what I mean?
Yeah, Luda

She got them handlebars
Gotta keep a tight grip on that donkey
She be givin' out battle scars
'Cause she got a tight grip on that monkey
She told me, all the weight, go straight to that ass
Make a student be late for the class
She make a nigga wanna holla even throw a couple dollars
So I gotta get straight to the cash
I love big cheeks in between them sheets
Jump back, I can't help myself
Got a nigga so weak and I get no sleep
'Cause the girls stay wetter than Michael Phelps
And she get right down to the business
She stimulate the five senses
And she like it when I grab her hair
But I might pull out them extensions
My intentions is good for her
She like that I'm rich and a lil hood for her
I beat it right and leave it good sore
Real niggas is always what I stood for
I'm all in, I don't play with it
I fall in and I lay in it
If I call in, I might stay in it
And if it's all a sin, then I'll pray in it

Yeah, she need her fix tonight (fix tonight)
Whoever she been with, he just ain't hittin' it right (hittin' it right)
So let me have my way with both your lips tonight (lips tonight)
Girl, take this D, I don't want you gettin' sick tonight (sick tonight, sick tonight)
She said go another round for me, another round (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D, yeah, yeah (she said she can take it)
She said go another round for me, another round (go another round for me)
She said she can take this D (she said she can take it)

She got them thunder thighs
I'm just tryna get struck by some lightnin'
Man, her booty is plus her size
And I like my cakes with some icin'
Yeah baby, [ciero a milo
Que a sabora azucca]
Bonita, freaky lil chica
Let's try the whole Kama Sutra, get down
Drip down, let it trickle down, dig her down
Smack it up, flip it and rub it down, love her down
I'ma keep it 100 now, that girl nasty
I'm never lettin' the opportunity pass me
But I love her boots when they thigh high
Guess it's true what they say when you're havin' fun, the time, it really do fly by
Take her legs, put 'em sky high
Climb to the top, I'ma skydive
Off, you feel the pump like it's sawed off
Shot gun, hold tight, don't fall off
Work, I'ma call off
Don't be tryna leave, lil mama, that's too much ass to haul off
You need a U-Haul, if you leave me, woman, I'ma get blue balls
'Cause ain't nobody got sex like you
That can dress like you or impress like you
You make a brother wanna woosa

Yeah, she need her fix tonight (fix tonight)
Whoever she been with, he just ain't hittin' it right (hittin' it right)
So let me have my way with both your lips tonight (lips tonight)
Girl, take this D, I don't want you gettin' sick tonight (sick tonight, sick tonight)

Ooh, she got that snapback
Kinda ass if you blink, that it might hurt you
All up on the Snapchat
Try to get a screenshot and she might curse you
That there be your eyes only
Love when she grind on me
If they said I'm talkin' shit
You know someone was lyin' on me
She ain't for that he say, she say
This shakin' the DJ replay
Is like everyday is her bday
'Cause everyday's her get this D day
And she got to work with a smile on
And her skin is always glowin'
And her JJ ain't all in the streets
'Cause she ain't out her hoein', Luda

===== Ludacris - The Potion =====
24 ContributorsThe Potion Lyrics
Whattup? Hey shawty, what it is?
Whattup? Hey shawty, what it is?
Whattup? Hey shawty, what it is?

Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion

Man I'm like a needle in a haystack, so face that
Go back to the drawing board, connect dots, but can't trace that
Matter fact, erase that, 'cause on this great track
Get your face slapped, and I'm straight so don't take that
Try somethin' different and shit, so listen and shit
Speakin' about what hip-hop is missin and shit
I'm about to fill a void, Ludacris born in Illinois
Raised in Atlanta, tote hammer since I was a little boy
Ain't nobody like me, so they wanna bite me
Fight me, step to me now but it ain't likely
People swear they sight me, just cause he's light-skinned
With braids in his hair don't mean that nigga looks like me
Trick get your mind right, livin' in the limelight
So picture what they'll do for my jimmy and a Klondike
Bar, bar, hardy-har
Tell yo' momma I'm a ghet-to su-per-star

Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion

Only standin' five eight but still a big shot, plus I got a big
Clean everyday, stay fresher than what's in a Ziploc
Tell your man to kick rocks, when I make my pitstops
I'm in, then it's hard to get me out like I'm a slip knot
Born to be a leader and not, no not a follower
Only hang with chicks that got mo' twists than Oliver
Not much of a hollerer, but I'd like to borrow her lips
Bringin out the best in me 'specially if she a swallower
Freaky deaky yellow man, and I'm sayin hello man
To all the lovely ladies that like to jiggle like Jello man
Bigger booty, small waist, put 'em in a small place
And if it ain't no ass where I'm at, then I'm in the wrong place
Bail like a bondsman, but keep 'em dancin'
Got pop potential, stay black like Bob Johnson
Who the hell is that in that fancy car?
Tell yo' momma I'm a ghet-to su-per-star

Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion

And jump down turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Jump down turn around, pick a bale of hay
Oh lordy, pick a bale of cotton
Oh lordy, pick a bale of hay
Jump down turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Jump down turn around, pick a bale of hay
Oh lordy, pick a bale of cotton
Oh lordy, pick a bale of hay

Still working like a slave, learning tricks of the trade
In a ghetto state of mind, say I'm rich and I'm paid
Pickin' records like cotton in the thick of the day
Till I'm spoiled and I'm rotten in a sinister way
Life no different than those on minimum wage
More money but still locked in a similar cage
Either losers of tomorrow or we winners today
Digest that and there's really nothin' missin' to say but

Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two-step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion
Lil' buddy what you want? Some violent shit!
Two step and lay back, still wilin' shit
Whattup? Hey baby, I got the potion
Take a sip of this and put your back in motion

===== Ludacris - Number one spot =====
43 ContributorsNumber One Spot Lyrics
Yeah, baby! Hehe, yeah
(Woo!) Back again! (That's right)
Luda!
Hahahaha (Feel this)
It gets meaner and meaner each time, baby
Feeling real good, too (Holla at 'em, man)
What up, Uncle 'Face? (Yeah!)
Haha, haha
I'm a bull in this industry, man (Tell 'em)
Some would rather run down and get one cow (Nah)
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all—you know what I'm talking 'bout, right? (You know what's up, right?)
Look—

I'm never going nowhere, so don't try me
My music sticks in fans' veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy—oh, they grimy!
Already offers on my sixth album from labels tryna sign me
Respected highly; Hi, Mr. O'Reilly!
Hope all is well—kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now, the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryna surprise me (Surprise!)
It's a celebration, and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (Bow!)
Explorer like Dora—these Swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so mean in my white tee
Nobody light-skinned'ed repping harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!

Whoa! Don't slip up or get got ("Why not, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot (Alright, woo!)
Rappers swearing they on top (Nuh-uh, uh-uh)
But I'm coming for they number-one spot (Alright, man)
Scheme-scheme, plot-plot (Say what?)
I'm coming for that number-one spot! (Woo! Hey)
Keep it going—it won't stop ("What you doing, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot

Yes, indeed! Ludacris: I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steering column on your Impala
If I get caught, bail-out; po'-po'—I tell 'em, "Holla"
In court, I never show up, like Austin Powers' fa-zha
"Father, father," and hey, I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a shmoke and a pancake
Drop albums nonstop, once a year for my fans' sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feeling so randy
I'm double-X-L, so I call 'em my "eye candy"
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar
'Cause I'm worth a million gazillion fafillion dollars

Whoa! Don't slip up or get got ("Why not, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot (Alright, woo!)
Rappers swearing they on top (Nuh-uh, uh-uh)
But I'm coming for they number-one spot (Alright, man)
Scheme-scheme, plot-plot (Say what?)
I'm coming for that number-one spot! (Woo! Hey)
Keep it going—it won't stop ("What you doing, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot

Causing lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Mes, models and Fat Bastards
These women trying to get me out my Pelle Pelles
They strip off my clothes and tell me, "Get in my belly!"
Stay on the track, hit the ground running like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time, and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen, ahh, boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world

Whoa! Don't slip up or get got ("Why not, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot (Alright, woo!)
Rappers swearing they on top (Nuh-uh, uh-uh)
But I'm coming for they number-one spot (Alright, man)
Scheme-scheme, plot-plot (Say what?)
I'm coming for that number-one spot! (Woo! Hey)
Keep it going—it won't stop ("What you doing, man?")
I'm coming for that number-one spot

Dope shit like that, Jerm
Oh, hi
Welcome back to K.I.D.S., um
Follow your dreams
Yeah

Wanna get a mansion, a jacuzzi
A theater to watch my movies
Couple whips and lots of fancy things
The kids they call the Goonies
I see the future, crystal ball
Mirror mirror hangin' on the wall
Who the flyest white boy of them all?
Got your girlfriend screenin' all the calls
She bubblin', we fuckin', then you cuddlin'
Like, baby, where the fuck you been?
Don't wanna tell you she in love with him
So, so we ain't sayin' nothin'
You could probably tell she bluffin'
'Cause she kiss you with the mouth
She gave me head with my concussion
Yeah, she blushin', all red
Wanna rush and go to bed
You interrogate that bitch like you the feds
So she says she in love with a rockstar, rockstar
Wanna smoke my weed, so she asks me where the tops are, tops are

Oh (Top drawer, haha), oh, oh (Yeah)
Honey, I need you 'round (Haha)
I know, I know (Just some motherfuckin' kids)
Oh, oh, oh
Honey, I need you 'round (Make money, fuck bitches)
I know (Yeah), I know (Pittsburgh, hey, Jerm, hey)

These hoes is drunk, wanna come and smoke this blunt
Then let me take 'em home and do anything I want
I said, baby, I can ride you, just let me get inside you
I can take you higher if you hit this vaporizer
I got that dope dick, I'll be your supplier
You grabbin' on my sheets and hittin' notes like you Mariah
Obsessed with me
Undress a freak on ecstasy
I'm out and then she textin' me
Like, "What you doin' next week, next week?" (Yeah)

Hear me now
I'm down on knees and praying
Though my faith is weak
Without you so please, baby, please
Give us a chance
Make amends and I will stand up 'til the end
A million times, a trillion more (Hey)

Oh, oh, oh (Hey, I just wanted to inform y'all)
Honey, I need you 'round (I'm drunk as fuck)
I know, I know (Most Dope, bitch, hey)
Oh, oh, oh (K.I.D.S., what's up?)
Honey, I need you 'round (I'm high as fuck, yeah, yes, sir)
I know, I know (Oh, I graduated, oh yeah, I just graduated high school, haha)

Hey, homie
Don't be mad that your girl loves me (Don't cut anything yet)
It's not my fault (Yeah)
I'm just doin' me (Haha)
If your girl love me, let her love me, you feel me?
So, baby
Smile (Uh-huh)
Baby, don't cry
I will only fly
With you by my side

I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feelin'
When you're high, but you're underneath the ceilin'
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealin', yeah
Get everything I need, then I'm gone, but it ain't stealin'
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always tryin' to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm sayin' it about

Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

When it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm runnin' out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of bein' so tired
Why I gotta build somethin' beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it, yeah
It's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's the problem with a closed door

Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad
Well, it ain't that bad, mm
At least it don't gotta be no more

No more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hey, hey
Mm, hey, mm, mm, mm

===== Mac Miller - Donald Trump =====
105 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisDonald Trump Lyrics
Hey
Ayo, Sap, what's good, bruh?
This man's kinda high out here

Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him 'cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now, I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say, "fuck it"
'Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit? (Hey)
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gon' win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

Uh, uh, uh
And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring her friends
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me, then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gon' win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

You don't wanna grow up, yeah, that shit no fun
So when I get home, I'ma give you some
Make you feel like "woo" when I hit that drum
Yeah, the dick ain't free, I don't give no fucks
Yeah, it's complicated, got you frustrated
Get home late and you don't trust me, baby
Way too drunk, you don't know what I'm sayin'
You can drive my car, don't drive me crazy

But just one more time, let's make love
One more time, it ain't much, fuck 'em all, let's be us
Summer's soft sweetness

===== Mac Miller - Small Worlds =====
122 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsFrançaisSmall Worlds Lyrics
Yeah, yeah

The world is so small 'til it ain't, yeah
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break
She hate it when I call and it's late
I don't wanna keep you waitin'
I hope I never keep you waitin', yeah

I think I know it all but I don't
Why you always at the mall when you're broke? Yeah
And I just wanna ball
Maybe dunk, but I never been tall, yeah
I might trip, I never fall
God knows I came close (Don't try this at home)
I know I probably need to do better
Fuck whoever, keep my shit together
You never told me bein' rich was so lonely
Nobody know me, oh well
Hard to complain from this five-star hotel
I'm always in a rush, I've been thinkin' too much, but
Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us

That's really all it takes
We don't need nothin' but today (Day), today (Day), today (Day), today (Day)

The world is so small 'til it ain't ('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break ('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call and it's late (And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waitin' (I don't wanna keep you waitin')
I hope I never keep you waitin' (I hope I never keep you waitin')

Woo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Woo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yeah, got a bad attitude, playin' 'til I'm out of moves
No need for shame, I get mo' peace at slow speeds
Go beat the game, young control freak
It's cold in my veins, I'm below freezin', snow season (Made me)
They know that I so need my space
Don't wanna grow old so I smoke just in case
She say that I glow below the waist
And the stroke is just so PGA
All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drawin' shapes and lines of a world we made
Tomorrow may be right around the corner
But I swear it's gon' be worth it if I make you wait
There's somewhere above you, keep reachin' up

That's really all it takes (That's really all it takes)
We don't need nothin' but today (Day), today (Day), today (Day), today (Day)

The world is so small 'til it ain't ('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm buildin' up a wall 'til it break ('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call and it's late (And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waitin' (I don't wanna keep you waitin')
I hope I never keep you waitin'
Yeah, nine times out of ten, I get it wrong
That's why I wrote this song, tell myself to hold on
I can feel my fingers slippin', in a motherfuckin' instant, I'll be gone
Do you want it all if it's all mediocre?
Starin' at the wall and the wall full of posters
Lookin' at my dreams, who I wanna be?
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Ooh, I been a fool but it's cool, that's what human beings do
Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes
Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun comin' out now, clouds start to move
Don't tell me nothin' but the truth
I'm tired, I don't got a spare second
Win or lose, win or lose
I don't keep count, nobody checkin'

Oh-oh (Hehehe)
Oh
The Divine Feminine, an album by Mac Miller
Oh-oh (The Divine Feminine, hehehe)
The Divine Feminine
Ooh (Hehehe, hehe)

Am I supposed to? Okay
Love
Love, love, love, love, love (Sex)
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love (Sex)

This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this all I know
I felt the highs and they feel like you
See, a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl, I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl, I'm so in love with you

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah (Baby)
Yeah, yeah
Um, well

Baby, you were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day, knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college?
Hours on the phone we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, goddamn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin', you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said, "All you ever think about is sex"
I'm like, "Oh well, you know me so well
And if this what make you late, I swear I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail"
Well, I'm the jealous type, but I swear that ass is what Heaven's like
And when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
It's my only chance, I better get it right

Take your time, my baby
It's all waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But it's all waitin' right here for you, for you

You would get close, I would run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your loving ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine (So divine)
Heaven probably not the same without you (Not the same)
But now you're in my world (In my world), in my world
Ah, ah, ah, ah

It's a blue world without you
It's a blue world alone

Yeah, well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mm, don't trip
We don't gotta let him in, don't trip
Yeah, yeah
I let it go, but I never go with it, mm

Yeah, okay, cool as fall weather, fuck the bullshit
I'm here to make it all better with a little music for you
I don't do enough for you
Without you, it's the color blue
Ooh, don't trip
I was in the city, they was talkin' that shit
Had the homies with me, all the sudden, they split
We ain't even worried, we just laughin', that's rich
You know how it goes, it ain't broke, don't fix

Hey, one of these days, we'll all get by
Don't be afraid, don't fall

Think I lost my mind, reality's so hard to find
When the devil tryna call your line, but shit, I always shine
Even when the light dim
No, I ain't God, but I'm feelin' just like Him
Ooh, don't trip
See, I was in the whip, ridin', me and my bitch
We was listenin' to us, no one else, that's it
That's a flex, just a bit, let me talk my shit
Say my head got big

Yeah, well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mm, don't trip
We don't gotta let him in, don't trip
Yeah, yeah
I let it go, but I never go with it, mm

Don't trip
Don't trip

Well, if you could see me now
Love me and hold me down
My mind, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes

Well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mm, don't trip
We don't gotta let him in, don't trip

I let it go, but I never go with it, mm

Hey, one of these days, we'll all get by
Don't be afraid, don't fall in line

I don't know why, but the beginning makes me smile

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe
See, me, I got you covered
I'ma be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy
We don't need to worry, we ain't in a hurry rushin' into love

Said, you know I know who you really are, ain't need to lie
Said, the universe couldn't keep us apart, why would it even try? Yeah
Said, don't let them hurt you ever, I know you far too smart
Before things come together, they have to fall apart
It's been a while since I've been sober, this life can be so hard
I'd rather talk about you

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are
And, baby, that's my favorite part (Oh)
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart
It'll be alright, babe
See, me, I got you covered
I'ma be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy
We don't need to worry, we ain't in a hurry rushin' into love, yeah, yeah

If you wanna stay, we're takin' it slow, baby
'Cause you want me, and I got enough on my mind
But I can make some time for somethin' so divine, oh, yeah

Said, you just don't know how beautiful you are (Yeah)
And, baby, that's my favorite part, baby
You walk around so clueless to it all
Like nobody gonna break your heart

See, me, I got you covered
I'ma be your lover, you might be the one
If it's only tonight, ayy
We don't need to worry, we ain't in a hurry rushin' into love

My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out
Of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

In my own way, this feel like livin'
Some alternate reality
And I was drownin', but now I'm swimmin'
Through stressful waters to relief
Yeah, oh, the things I'd do
To spend a little time in Hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself
Don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day?
I wish it was nice out, but it look like rain
Grey skies are driftin', not livin' forever
They told me it only gets better

My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out
Of my head
I'll do anything for a way out

No matter how many miles it take
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light, turn to day
Can't stop, then you won't stop
I know just how that feel
When you're on top, 'til the ball drop
You've never seen it be so real
It feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light, turn to day

Feel it a little, feel it a lot
I'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
Keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
Into some shit, I'm out of the box
This the level I'm on, needin' it all right now or forever is gone
Baby, the weather is strong, whether it's hot or cold
I'm comin', knockin' on yo' door
Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain how I'm stayin' so high
Put the ladder all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
All I, all I, all I wanna do is free yo' mind
We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size, yeah
See the bigger picture when it's beneficial
Lovin' how I fit you, blow the whistle when you run out of time, yeah
Wakin' up, I open up my eyes
Do you mind if I blow yo' mind?
A little closer, baby, don't be shy
Why you worried that it's gon' be fine?
I guess it's that kinda day
It's really all I'm tryna say
We don't have a lot of time to waste
Somehow we gotta find a way

Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light, turn to day

I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got


Yeah, yeah
All the lights flickerin', hittin' the right switches
I'm livin' this life different and missin' the flight bullshittin'
I had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
Little delayed, but I came and you cool wit' it
I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
And I don't know it all, but I do know this
Before you know me, better know self
I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
I turn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like a king for a grand
I don't do nothin', that's a hassle
Besides, even that castle made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all, if it all ain't me
Maybe we inside the maze
Somehow we gotta find a way, okay

Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light, turn to day

I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot yo' shot
We don't need no more, no extras

Let 'em in, let 'em in, let 'em in (Hey)

I feel like a million bucks
But my money don't really feel like I do
And from the ground, I built my own damn buzz
People was amazed I was still in high school
But now I'm out, and money what I'm 'bout
Tryna get so much that I can't keep count
New kicks give me cushion like whoopie
Keep a smile like an Eat'n Park cookie
Everything good, I'm white boy awesome
Up all night, Johnny Carson
I ain't got a Benz, no, just a Honda
But tryna get my money like an Anaconda
Real, real long, cross the country
Smoke joints in the whip, no cop can bust me
Drive into the stage, they applaud and scream
All them pretty little girls come and flock with me
Yeah, I rock the beat

Milli Vanilli but this is really how it goes
Mouth my words, don't say shit
Shh, shut up, bitch, and ride this dick
I'm just playing, let's have a ball
All we need is some weed, hoes and alcohol, hey
Don't forget it when I'm wreckin' the etiquette for the hell of it
Smellin' it when the L is lit, I'm flyer than a pelican
Young fresh, but I'm so damn intelligent
Girls givin' brains 'cause I'm acting like a gentleman
In deeper than the water Michael Phelps was in

Drivin' with my eyes closed, missin' all the signs
Turn the ignition, I'm driven and sittin' pretty (Pretty)
Listenin' to Whitney and whippin' it through the city, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Man on a mission, figure it out
Puttin' way too much on my shoulders, please hold me down (Down, down)

That Mercedes through the P.A. when I pull up (Pull up)
Soundin' like a concert, or a (Or a)

126 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolFrançaisPortuguêsWhat’s the Use? Lyrics
Yeah

You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute wit' it, fuck a little
What's the use?
Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice

Yeah
Okay, we're colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker, hol' up
You don't need to hol' up, yeah
And I can show you how I seem
What it is, what it truly might be, nothin' that you know of
You don't need to hol' up
I'm so a-bove and beyond
You take drugs to make it up way up where we on
Space shuttle, Elon
Time, we don't waste much, fuck when we wake up
Then I have her sing just like Céline Dion
Catch me if you can but, you'll never catch me, damn
Whole lotta, "Yes, I am"
All the way in wit' no exit plan
Already left and the jet don't land
Yeah, the time is tickin', come take a ride, get inside
This is highly different, I'm talkin' fly, got a pilot wit' 'im, uh
Can I mind my business?
Why you trippin'? Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness
Ooh, you're too close
I don't understand why you doin' the most

You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just (I just) want a (Want a) 'nother ('Nother) minute (Minute) wit' it
Fuck a little, what's the use?

You gon' (You gon') know it (Know it) when it (When it) hit you (Hit you)
Get a (Get a) little (Little) senti- (Senti) -mental when I'm off the juice (Turn it up)

Well, I'ma give you what you came for, yeah
Shit, I've worked too hard to have a clue who you are
Set the bar so far above par, we can parlay all day
Crib long range with the yard
I know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me
'Cause I save the day, spend money
When I had nothin', shit, it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name
But it never worry my brain
Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'
Tell the sun, "Get up outta my shade"
If they don't get the picture, cut 'em outta that frame, shit
I'm up thirty thou' miles plus change
It's been a while but I'm down 'til I'm out
And it is what it is 'til it ain't, yeah

Ooh-oh, up above the clouds
Ooh, I just wanna fly
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ha

You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just (I just) want a (Want a) 'nother ('Nother) minute (Minute) wit' it

Blue suede shoes stay crispy like bacon
Nikes on my feet make my cypher complete, uh
I stay shining like the lights on the street in the night
Revis take me shoppin' when I'm up in New York
Hit the shoe store, go and cop a few more
You at the mall getting dinner at the food court
I'm in LA eatin' twenty-two course
Young boss, bitch, paper in my pockets
I got a closet filled with shoeboxes
Mom said my spending habit little bit obnoxious
But a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit
Used to rock hand-me-downs
Now I buy some clothes, wear 'em out
Hit the club, bitches pull they cameras out
Livin' in a dream, they beginnin' to believe
My hotel smell like cigarettes and weed
Shit, with what I'm spittin', they should give me a degree
Good liquor, what I'm sippin' isn't cheap, uh
Finna blow, don't snooze, don't sleep

Pippens on my feet, they the throwbacks, look
My money good, but these hoes bad
So they stay attached to my gonads, uh
Wakin' up to a few L's
Open up my closet to that new shoe smell
I guess I'm doin' well
Smokin' all the weed that I used to sell
But once my album goes in the shelves
It's going Nextel how it's finna sell
For now, we're sellin' tapes out my shoebox
Any spot, just set up my shop
You're mad that your girl always says that I'm hot
She buyin' my t-shirts, but she spendin' your guap, uh
Say, "What up?" if you see me around

Yeah
Eric
Well

I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

Yeah, okay, you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's alright with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'
The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about
And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhm
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yea high and muddy
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me

But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door

Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war
See, me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it, I was diggin' me a hole
Big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
My own, with these arms I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone, and I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm

Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more

Because your fragrance got me faded, you be keepin' me high
Said nothin' better than the first time
I'll be at your service like the check-in at the curbside
You don't have to spend another second on this Earth dry
Wet you like a fresh pool, go a second and a third time
Left you a perverse mind
And when you hungry, I can chef you up a stir fry
Get you some dessert wine, elevate your third eye
First prize, Nobel, get a piece
Your clothes off, turn around, lemme see

'Cause my boy's new girl is your best friend
Act like you don't see me, we'll play pretend
Your eyes already told me what you never said
Now we're in the backseat of the black car, goin' home

We're both drunk on the elevator
When I kiss you for the first time in New York City, uh

I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (Yeah)

First off, I'm not sorry, I won't apologize to nobody
You play like I'm invisible, girl, don't act like you ain't saw me
Last year was a mess and how I acted was beyond me
But the past still revolves me, you text me, I ain't responding
But now shit's done changed
Go our separate ways
But look at this damage you did to me
I still want nothin' to do between you and me
Please don't say nothin', it all sounds untrue to me
We don't got nothin' to say, hey

I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (Yeah)
I swear to God (I swear to God), I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it (I can't get enough of you)
I swear to God (I swear to God), I never fall in love (In love)
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (I can't get enough of it, yeah)

You know my ex, so that makes it all feel complicated, yeah
(It all seems complicated)
I read those texts that you sent to yours, but I'll never say it, yeah
(I'll never say—)

===== mgk - Bad Things =====
188 ContributorsBad Things Lyrics
Am I out of my head? Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say? It's complicated
Don't matter what you say, don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good (So good), that you can't explain it
What can I say? It's complicated (Ayy)

Nothing's that bad if it feels good
So you come back like I knew you would
And we're both wild and the night's young
And you're my drug, breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum, I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tat, eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips while my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life and you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever, even when we're not together (Ayy, ayy)
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like (Ayy, ayy)
I want you forever, even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever, uh (Yeah)

Am I out of my head? Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say? It's complicated
Don't matter what you say, don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say? It's complicated (Damn)

I can't explain it, I love the pain (Ayy, ayy)
And I love the way that your breath numbs me like novocaine
And we are always high (Ooh), keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane, but you the same
Let me paint the picture, uh (Yeah), couch by the kitchen, ayy (Yeah)
Nothin' but your heels on, losin' our religion (Mm)
You're my pretty little vixen and I'm that voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

I want you forever, even when we're not together (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like (Ayy, ayy)
I want you forever, even when we're not together (Oh)
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever, uh (Yeah)

Am I out of my head? Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say? It's complicated
Don't matter what you say, don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say? It's complicated

The way we love is so unique (Ayy, ayy)
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it, just you and me (Right)
'Cause we're just living between the sheets (You said)

I want you forever, even when we're not together (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like
I want you forever, even when we're not together (Ayy, real talk, oh)
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever, yeah (Oh, baby)

Am I out of my head? Am I out of my mind? (Am I? Am I?)
If you only knew the bad things I like (If you only knew)
Don't think that I can explain it (Yeah)
What can I say? It's complicated (Yeah)
Don't matter what you say, don't matter what you do (Do, do)
I only wanna do bad things to you (Yeah)
So good, that you can't explain it (So good; oh, baby)
What can I say? It's complicated

75 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolفارسیРусскийI Think I’m OKAY Lyrics
Watch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week, wasting time with people I don't like
I think something's fucking wrong with me

Drown myself in alcohol, that shit never helps at all
I might say some stupid things tonight when you pick up this call
I've been hearing silence on the other side for way too long
I can taste it on my tongue, I can tell that something's wrong, but
I guess it's just my life and I can take it if I wanna
But I cannot hide in hills of California
Because these hills have eyes, and I got paranoia
I hurt myself sometimes, is that too scary for you?

Watch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week, wasting time with people I don't like
I think that something's fucking wrong with me
Roll me up and smoke me, love
And we can fly into the night
Roll me up and smoke me, love
And we can fly into the night
You take drugs (Take drugs) to let go (To let go)
And figure it all out on your own
Take drugs (Take drugs) on gravestones (On gravestones)
To figure it all out on your own

Watch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week, wasting time with people I don't like
I think that something's fucking wrong with me

Find me alone at midnight
Inside my mind, tryna get things right
(Something's fucking wrong with me)
They want to keep you calling
So you don't wake in the morning
(Something's fucking wrong with me)
Goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, yeah (Goodnight)
Find me alone at midnight (Goodnight)
Inside my mind, tryna get things right (Goodnight)
They want to keep you calling (Goodnight)
So you don't wake in the morning

Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home (Let's go)
Someone take me

Look, I didn't power through the struggle
Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feet, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from tryin' to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm startin' to lose faith

Now tell me, how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm tryna find

Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home (It's been a long time coming)
Someone take me (Oh)

Home, oh, oh, oh
Home, home
Someone take me
Home, oh, oh, oh
Home, home

Look, I've been through so much pain
And it's hard to maintain any smile on my face
'Cause there's madness on my brain
So I gotta make it back, but my home ain't on the map
Gotta follow what I'm feelin' to discover where it's at
I need the (Memory)
In case this fate is forever, just to be sure these last days are better
And if I have any (Enemies)
To give me the strength to look the devil in the face and make it home safe

Now tell me, how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces
Tell me why the world never fights fair
I'm tryna find

Home
A place where I can go
To take this off my shoulders
Someone take me home
Someone take me

I found no cure for the loneliness
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
I found no cure for the loneliness (Oh-oh)
I found no cure for the sickness
Nothing here feels like home
Crowded streets, but I'm all alone
Someone take me
Home, oh, oh, oh
Take me home (Take me home), home
Someone take me
Home (Baby, I need it; somebody, somebody), oh, oh, oh (Ain't no place like home)
Home (Take me home), home

Okay
The simulation just went bad
But you're the best I ever had
Like handprints in wet cement
She touched me, it's permanent

In my head, in my head
I couldn't hear anything you said, but
In my head, in my head
I'm callin' you "girlfriend," what the fuck?

I don't do fake love
But I'll take some from you tonight
I know I've got to go
But I might just miss the flight
I can't stay forever, let's play pretend
And treat this night like it'll happen again
You'll be my bloody valentine tonight

I'm overstimulated and I'm sad
I don't expect you to understand
It's nothing less than true romance
Or am I just makin' a mess?

In my head, in my head
I'm lyin' naked with you, yeah
In my head, in my head
I'm ready to die holding your hand

I don't do fake love
But I'll take some from you tonight (Take some from you tonight)
I know I've got to go
But I might just miss the flight
I can't stay forever, let's play pretend
And treat this night like it'll happen again
You'll be my bloody valentine tonight

I can't hide
How I feel about you inside
I'd give everything up tonight
If I could just have you, be mine
Be mine, baby
I can't hide (I cannot hide these feelings, no)

Let me take my fuckin' bracelet off

You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me, baby
Yeah, I bet you do

Damn
I saw you walk in the room and I tried my best
Not to panic while I'm lookin' for the back door
I smelled the perfume and it's obvious
I'm gonna stay and put my key in the bag more
I can't, I can't, I can't pretend to forget
You're the reason I punched a hole in the wall back home
And then, and then, and then a couple hours later
We're in room 29 at The Chateau

I left before you woke up
I don't feel right (Seeing you sober)

You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me, baby
Yeah, I bet you do
I'm keepin' you waiting
But I won't wait on you
Want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too

I've wasted so much time
Waitin' around for your phone calls every night
My bad dreams are silk-screened
'Cause I taste blood when you bleed
It's eating me alive
We'd both be better off alone
Still think I'd get you on the phone
With one last breath in me
I'd die before I let you leave

You left before I woke up
Why don't I ever see you sober?

You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me, baby
Yeah, I bet you do
I'm keepin' you waiting
But I won't wait on you
You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too

Hey you
Tell me why you do the things that make me
Hate you
It's an emotional kaleidoscope when I
Face you
Permanent calligraphy, I just
Tattooed
Your name on me forever, fuck

You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me, baby
Yeah, I bet you do

(Oh my God, RONNY) Ayy

Somebody grab him some clippers (Zzt), his fuckin' beard is weird
Tough talk from a rapper payin' millions for security a year
"I think my dad's gone—" (Ah), yeah, Hailie, you right
Dad's always mad cooped up in the studio, yellin' at the mic
You sober and bored, huh? (I know) 'Bout to be forty-six years old, dog
Talkin' 'bout "I'ma call up Trick Trick," man, you sound like a bitch, bitch
Man up and handle your shit (Ugh)
Mad about somethin' I said in 2012, took you six years and a surprise album just to come with a diss? (Huh)
Homie, we get it, we know that you're the greatest rapper alive
Fuckin' dweeb, all you do is read the dictionary and stay inside
Fuck "Rap God", I'm the Rap Devil
Comin' bare-faced with a black shovel
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle
His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'

I'm sick of them sweatsuits, and them corny hats, let's talk about it
I'm sick of you bein' rich, and you still mad, let's talk about it
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body and put some white chalk around it (Ayy)

Let's talk about the fact you actually blackballed a rapper that's twice as young as you (Let's talk about it)
Let's call Sway, ask why I can't go up to Shade 45 because of you (Brrt)
Let's ask Interscope how you had Paul Rosenberg tryin' to shelf me (Huh?)
Still can't cover up the fact your last four albums is bad as your selfie
Now tell me, what do you stand for? (What?)
I know you can't stand yourself (True)
Tryna be the old you so bad, you stan yourself (Ha)
Let's leave all the beefin' to 50 (Please), Em, you're pushin' fifty
Why you claimin' that I'ma call Puff when you the one that called Diddy? (Facts)
Then you went and called Jimmy (Facts), they conference-called me in the mornin' (What?)
They told me you mad about a tweet, you wanted me to say sorry (What?)
I swear to God, I ain't believe him (Nah), please say it ain't so (No)
The big bad bully of the rap game can't take a fuckin' joke
Oh, you want some fuckin' smoke (What?)
But not literally, you'll choke
Yeah, I'll acknowledge you're the GOAT
But I'm The Gunner, bitch, I got you in the scope (Brrah)
Don't have a heart attack now (Uh), somebody help your mans up (Help)
Knees weak of old age, the real Slim Shady can't stand up

I'm sick of them sweatsuits, and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich, and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Uh-huh)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body and put some white chalk around it

Hello, Marshall, my name's Colson, you should go back to Recovery (Phew)
I know your ego is hurtin', just knowin' that all of your fans discovered me (Hi)
He like, "Damn, he a younger me, 'cept he dresses better and I'm ugly, always makin' fun of me"
Stop all the thuggery, Marshall, you livin' in luxury (Ayy)
Look what you done to me, dropped an album just because of me, damn, you in love with me
You got money, but I'm hungry, I like the diss, but you won't say them lyrics out in front of me
Shout-out to every rapper that's up under me, know that I'll never do you like this fuckery
Still bitter after everyone loves you, pull that wedgie out your dungarees (Ayy)
I gotta respect the OGs, and I know most of 'em personally (Ayy)
But you're just a bully actin' like a baby, so I gotta read you a nursery (Pussy)
I'm the ghost of the future, and you're just Ebenezer Scrooge (Eh)
I said on Flex, "Anyone could get it", I ain't know it would be you

I'm sick of them sweatsuits, and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich, and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Uh-huh)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body and put some white chalk around it

Ayy, ridin' shotty 'cause I gotta roll this dope
It's a fast road (When your idols become your rivals), yeah
Never hesitate to say it to your face
I'm an asshole (Oh my God, RONNY)
Bitch-ass motherfuck; Kells

We know you get nervous, Rabbit, I see Mama's spaghetti all over your sweater
I wish you would lose yourself on the records that you made a decade ago, they were better
Accordin' to them, you're a national treasure, to me, you're as soft as a feather
The type to be scared to ask Rihanna for her number, just hold her umbrella-ella-ella
"I'm not afr—," okay, Oscar the Grouch, chill on the couch (Fuck)
You got a Oscar, damn, can anyone else get some food in their mouth? (For real)
They made a movie about you, you're in everybody's top ten
You're not getting better with time, it's fine, Eminem, put down the pen
Or write an apology over the simple fact you had to diss to acknowledge me
I am the prodigy, how could I even look up to you? You ain't as tall as me
5'8" and I'm 6'4", seven punches, hold your head still
Last time you saw 8 Mile was at home on a treadmill
You were named after a candy, I was named after a gangster (Brr)
And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you (Thank you)
I just wanna feed my daughter, you tryna stop the money to support her
You the one always talkin' 'bout the action, text me the addy, I'm pullin' up scrappin'
And I'm by my fuckin' self, what's happenin'? EST Captain, salute me or shoot me
That's what he's gonna have to do to me when he realizes that there ain't shit he could do to me
Everybody always hated me, this isn't anything new to me
Yeah, there's a difference between us, I got all of my shit without Dre producin' me (Ayy)
I know you're not used to me, usually one of your disses should ruin me
But, bitch, I'm from Cleveland, everybody quiet this evenin', I'm readin' the eulogy (Shh)
You dropped an album called Kamikaze, so that means he killed him
I already fucked one rapper's girl this week, don't make me call Kim

I'm sick of them sweatsuits, and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich, and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)

Maybe if I had something to say
Butterfly effect from the last three days now
Maybe if I had something to save
I used to have a soul until I threw it away
There's shadows on the wall, wish I would've ran (Yeah)
Gotta get away, I hope you understand (Mm)
I try to hide my face like a wanted man (Yeah)
Maybe I'll be gone before you count to ten

I made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking thе last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm rеady to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last

Maybe if we went another way (Another way)
I wouldn't be regretting the decisions that I made
I, I don't want to spend another day (Another day)
Looking for somebody that I know I can't replace
My tears fall, you don't miss me
Put me out my misery
Think my heart is history
I think I'm broke and nothing can fix me

I made up my mind this evening

Drink while my conscience eats me

We were built to fall apart
But I can't feel you now
And it's too late now, there's no point screaming
Dug your grave, so fuck your feelings
No one's here, so now you're on your own

I made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go

All alone in the glass house
Lie awake 'til the sun's out
Pink sky when you come down
M3 in the driveway
Caffeine for the heartache
Never wanna have it my way

Yeah, I fuck up and lose control
Burned so many bridges, got nowhere to go
Bitches got these motives like Anna Nicole
I'm smoking cigarettes alone until it burn a hole
In my lungs, in my soul, in my denim coat
Same place I'ma keep that knife if I'ma slit my throat
This shit ugly, I was just with Nipsey, now he ghost
They even got my homie Pete out here, like, fuck the jokes
Damn

All alone in the glass house (Just keep it going)
Lie awake 'til the sun's out
Pink sky when you come down
Sometimes I wanna fucking scream or run away, I don't know

Ayy, life's been hard since seventeen
I've been through hell, I think I'm somewhere in-between
Caught in purgatory, I can paint the scene
Everything turned to a nightmare from a dream
Look, wish Lil Peep and me had spoke, but I can't get that back
Just came from Pittsburgh, damn, I miss my homie Mac
Yeah, last time I got off the stage, I looked Chester in the face
But now he gone and ain't no going back, uh

Why don't you throw me in the damn flame?
Bury me in gold chains
Throw me in the damn flame
I'm waiting on the rain to come and wash it all away
Why don't you throw me in the damn flame?
Bury me in gold chains
Throw me in the damn flame

Lately I've been sick of living and nobody knows how I'm really feeling
I always hated to smile, but it keep what is killing me hidden inside
I didn't sign up to be the hero, but I don't want to wind up a villain
I put my daughter to bed, then attempted to kill myself in the kitchen
Yeah, I should've screamed, but nobody listened
So I passed out with the blood dripping
In this glass house, feeling like a prison
Me and death keep tongue-kissing
I just fell out with my lil' bro, the life getting to us
The drink getting to us, the drugs getting to us
It's highway to hell and everybody knew it
The fuck are we doing? I'm feeling like

Why don't you throw me in the damn flame?
Bury me in gold chains
Throw me in the damn flame
I'm waiting on the rain to come and wash it all away
Why don't you throw me in the damn flame?
Bury me in gold chains
Throw me in the damn flame

All alone in the glass house
Lie awake 'til the sun's out
Pink sky when you come down
M3 in the driveway
Caffeine for the heartache
Never wanna have it my way

I swallowed a pill that was in a heart shape
Her hands on my chest, feelin' my heartbeat
She spillin' her drink all on my car seat
She'll get attached and then trap me
Then I gotta act like I'm happy
She posts pics to get at me
Déjà vu, it's like last week

I kept my dealer's number
I'm still young, wasting my youth
I'll grow up next summer

===== mgk - At My Best =====
87 ContributorsAt My Best Lyrics
Turn my vocals up, alright

I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody findin' their-self
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up, I'm feelin' the same
I got issues just like you got issues
I've been hurt, I seen the scar tissue
If I showed you, would you run away?
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay?
Do I, even need you? Should I leave you?
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you?
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you
Through my heart? Quit tearin' mine apart

I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
I gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up
'Cause life is about...
Aight check this out

Life is about makin' mistakes
It's also about trying to be great
Do not let failure scare you away
I know you fed up, you fall, get up
It's all in us, I can speak about it 'cause I did it (true)
Ladies and gentlemen, here's the exhibit
It's my life, look a little closer, you can see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em
Look at all the years I've been waitin' for a moment
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the mornin'
Tell me could you love me? Tell me could you love me?
Tell me could you love me if I told you...

I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

This song's for anybody
Who feels like I did, never the cool kid
This song's for anybody
Who fought their way through, always remained true
This song's for anybody
The one's who trying to get it, the one's who dream it and live it
This song's for anybody
This song, this song, this song, this song, this song, this song

Ohh, I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh
I gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up
'Cause life is about...

Ayy, I still remember what you wore on the first night
Still remember how that black dress had your curves right
Still remember smokin' just to calm my nerves
'Til you had to leave and grabbed your purse, I grabbed first
Uh, it's no words, yeah, it's just her
Body against mine, makeup on my shirt
Lipstick on my neck, whiskey on my breath
Takin' pictures in the moment so we don't forget, yeah

Woah, woah
She said, "You need to let me go"
Woah, woah
She said, "I'd die for you"
"You're like my drug, but I can't get high off you"

Tried to lay me down and so I dodged and ran away
Put a gun up to my face, so I'll fuckin' catch a case (A case)
When I find this mothеrfucker, gonna lay him in his grave

I wanna know if I tell you a secret, will you keep it?
If a pussy wanna say shit, then I'll fuckin' stomp his face in
Nah, not getting better, can't change it, I left blood all on the pavement
I'm on borrowed time, can't shake it, uh, blackout when I'm ragin', uh
Me and all these pills be on a fuckin' first name basis, uh
There's an invisible voice that is talkin' to me and it's always tellin' me to kill
I got a problem with separating what my head is creating from things that are real
I'm in a room, hyperventilating and debating to pop off the cap of these pills
If I get angry, I'm goin' to start up a riot like people on Capitol Hill

Be free like a bird, so today I'ma fly
Bad, bad motherfucker 'til the day I die
Be free like a bird, so today I'ma fly

Take a bath in the champagne, wild motherfucker
Straight from the block, dog, ducking shots walking to the store
Dollar for a Black & Mild, motherfucker
Blew up as a rockstar, so I'm top floor
Throwing drinks on a cop car, foul motherfucker
The only number calling up my phone
Is from my dealer, swear that dude will not leave me alone
'Cause he knows when I pick up, I'ma cop a couple zones
And my girl know I ain't fuckin' 'til she roll me up a cone (Woo)

Gold teeth like the Nolia, keep 'em on, yeah

And they give me pussy three hundred sixty-five days a year, bitch
I'm the type to never go to sleep (What?)
I'm the type to break a couple motherfuckers' teeth (Blah)
I'm the type to drop a hit of acid on the beach
And fly to Baltimore and scream, "Fuck the police" (Ah)
Do not get it twisted, this is not an image
There are legends told about the nights I'm in the buildings (Kells)
It is not a question whether or not I'm the trillest
Every bitch is pressing me to get some cum on they acrylics
1.5 million for my record deal and now I got the feeling

So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty
Having me, then he told the people, "You can call me Your Majesty"
Keep your battery charged, you know it won't stick, yo
And it's not his fault you kick slow
Should've let your trick ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter, peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow ("Your mother—"), don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa, whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try, villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out the square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you, it's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name

And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'
The pot doubles, now they really got troubles
Madman never go *pop* like snot bubbles

Tripping off the beat kinda, dripping off the meat grinder
Heat niner, pimping, stripping, soft sweet minor
China was a neat signer, trouble with the script
Digits double dipped, bubble lipped, subtle lisp midget
Borderline schizo, sort of fine tits though
Pour the wine, whore to grind, quarter to nine, let's go
Ever since ten eleven, glad she made a brethren
Then it's last down seven alligator seven
At the gates of heaven, knockin'—no answer
Slow dancer, hopeless romancer, dopest flow stanzas
Yes, no? Villain, Metal Face to Destro
Guess so, still incredible in escrow
Just say, "Ho!" I'll test the yayo
Wild West style fest, y'all best to lay low
Hey bro, DayGlo, set the bet, pay dough
Before the cheddar get away, best to get Maaco
The worst hated God who perpetrated odd favors
Demonstrated in the perforated Rod Lavers
… In all quad flavors, Lord save us
Still back in the game like Jack LaLanne
Think you know the name, don't rack your brain
On a fast track to half insane
Either in a slow beat or that the speed of "Wrath of Kane"
Laughter, pain
Hackthoo'ing songs lit, in the booth, with the best host
Doing bong hits, on the roof in the west coast
He's at it again, Mad at the pen
Glad that we win, a tad fat, in a bad hat for men
Grind the cinnamon, Manhattan warmongers
You can find the villain in satin … congas
The van screeches, the old man preaches
About the gold sand beaches, the cold hand reaches
For the old tan Ellesses …
… Jesus

===== Madvillain - Fancy Clown =====
147 ContributorsTranslationsРусскийEspañolNederlandsPortuguêsFancy Clown Lyrics
I hear you in the background
Whenever I phone
Tellin' your brother
To say you're gone
("Hello")
Put your sister on the phone
"You've been trippin' around, uptown"
Yo, it's Viktor
"Wooin' some fancy clown"
I knew you was ****ing around
Playing all innocent and ho'ing since the foundation
Don't make me have to pound his tin crown face in
And risk being jammed up like traffic, inbound from space and
There's been a place for you in my heart since we first met
A teenage love that didn't feel no hurt yet
My boys warned me you was poison like BBD first cassette
And still I put my chips on the worse bet
Gave up the skirt, now I gotta hear it from the street
How dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
You could've broke it off, ended it and dipped
And if you spoke us off, we could've still preserved the friendship
Now you apologize, that's what they all say
You wasn't sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway
But have it your way, raw— no foreplay
That's you if you want a dude who wear a mask all day
And just to think, I used to be proud of you
And you had some real good power

"You've been trippin' around, uptown"
No, it wasn't— it wasn't nothing like that
Well, my brother, he didn't tell me you had called
"Wooin' some fancy clown"
I wasn't at home

Probably kissed me later that evening, I should be hurling
Matter fact, gimme back my bracelet and my Shearling
I rather waste it or give it to your girlfriend
She did let me stab it last week while you was workin'
Remember, our vacation out to Maryland?
I duked the maid Carolyn, she made me throw the towel in
Like all foul men, the time I hit your moms off
I told her knock it off, but she had to set the rocket off
Ain't enough room in this ****ing town
When you see tin head, tell him "be ducking down"
I'm not rompin' around, he better be
Ready and prepared to be stomped in the ground

"Well, I thought it was big as my "
"And now, subscriber, we've got to punch you up
So, please stand by"

Living off borrowed time, the clock ticks faster
That'd be the hour they knock the slick blaster
Dick Dastardly and Muttley with sick laughter
A gunfight and they come to cut the mixmaster
I-C-E cold, nice to be old
Y2G stee twice to threefold
He sold scrolls, lo and behold
Know who's the illest ever like the greatest story told
Keep your glory, gold and glitter
For half, half of his niggas'll take him out the picture
The other half is rich and it don't mean shit-ta
Villain: a mixture between both with a twist of liquor
Chase it with more beer, taste it like truth or dare
When he have the mic, it's like the place get like, "Aw, yeah!"
It's like they know what's 'bout to happen
Just keep ya eye out like, "Aye, aye, captain"
Is he still a fly guy clapping if nobody ain't hear it?
And can they testify from in the spirit? (Nah)
In living, the true gods
Giving y'all nothing but the lick like two broads
Got more lyrics than the church got "Ooh, Lords"
And he hold the mic and your attention like two swords
(Either that) Or either one with two blades on it
Hey you, don't touch the mic like it's AIDS on it (Yuck)
It's like the end to the means
Fuck type of message that sends to the fiends?
That's why he bring his own needles
And get more cheese than Doritos, Cheetos or Fritos
Slip like Freudian
Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordion

When he at the mic, you don't go next
Leaving pussy cats like why hoes need Kotex
Exercise index, won't need BowFlex
And won't take the one with no skinny legs like Joe Tex

"Life is—"
To two one-two
How DOOM hold heat and preach non-violence?
Shh, he about to start the speech, c'mon, silence!
On one starry night, I saw the light
Heard a voice that sound like Barry White said, "Sure you're right"
Don't let me find out who tried to bite
They better off goin' to fly a kite in a firefight
During tornado time with no coat than I caught ya
Wrote the book on rhymes, a note from the author
With no headshot, he said it's been a while
Got a breadwinner style to get a inner child a finna smile
And that's no exaggeration
The doctor told a patient, "It's all in your imagination, negro"
Ah, what do he know?
About the buttery flow, he need to cut the ego
Trippin', to date the Metal Fellow, been rippin' flows
Since New York plates was ghetto yellow
With broke blue writing, this is too exciting
Folks leave out the show feelin' truly enlightened
They say, "The Villain been spitting enough lightning
To rock shock the Boogie Down to Brighton". Aight then

Yeah, check, listen up
Uh, yeah, now

How M.E.D. hold heat like Clint East is reborn?
Leave 'em with more holes than a dartboard
Haters watch him, Hennessy double-shot drink
Like the answer to the problem's at the bottle's bottom
Uh, from the bottom, top that homie, pay how you owe me
My niggas take "No" like Kobe
Even with the arms of the Hulk, you couldn't hold me
From gettin' mines, stogies be rolled, smokin' and gettin' by
Thanks rap, I ain't got a dime
Got me sneakin' out of checkout lines with bottles by the waist side
Yeah, smack 'em in the face, let 'em taste pride
Face trial, end up washed up like the shorelines
Do or die ride, how the dead return
Street turns, keep me in this dirt like an earthworm
What he spit hits and grows, will brothers ever learn
Worth a word, chat with a nerd, meeting adjourned

The rest is empty with no brain, but the clever nerd
The best MC with no chain ya ever heard
Take it from the TEC-9 holder
They've bit, but don't know they neck shine from Shinola
Everything that glitter ain't fishscale
Lemme think, don't let her faint get Ishmael
A shot of Jack got her back it's not a act stack
Forgot about the cackalack, holla back; clack-clack, blocka
Villainy, feel him in ya heart chakra, chart-toppa
Start-shit stoppa, be a smart shoppa
Shot-a-Cop day around the way 'bout to stay
But who'd a know there's two mo' that wonder where the shooter go
'Bout to jet, get him, not a bet, dead 'em
Let 'em spit the venom said 'em got a lot of shit with 'em
Let the rhythm hit 'em, it's stronger in the other voice
We makes the joints that make 'em spread 'em butta moist
Man, please, the stage is made of panties
From the age of baby hoochies on to the grannies
Ban me the dough rake, daddy
The flow make her fatty shake, patty cake, patty cake
For fake, if he was Anita Baker's man
He'd take her for her masters, hit it once an' shake her hand
On some ol' thank ya ma'am an' ghost her
She could mind the toaster if she sign the poster
A whole host of roller coaster riders
Not enough tracks (Is it?), hot enough black (For ya)
It's too hot to handle, you got blue sandals
Who shot ya? Ooh, got you new spots to vandal?
Do not stand still, boast yo' skills
Close but no krills, toast for po' nils, post no bills
Coast to coast Joe Shmoe's flows ill, go chill
Not supposed to overdose No-Doz pills
Off pride tykes talk wide through scar meat
Off sides like how Worf rides with Starfleet
Told ya, on some get-rich shit
As he gets older he gets colder than a witch tit
This is it, make no mistakes where my nigga go?
Figaro, Figaro
O's beats and my rhymes attack
A scary act, all black like Ms. Mary Mack
Wait 'til you see 'em live on the piano
DOOM sing soprano, like, "Una, duociano"
My momma told me
Blast 'em and pass her her glass of Ol' E
Not to be troublesome, but I could sure use
A quick shot of double rum, no stick of bubble gum
I like ice cream, we could skip the weddin'
Have a nice dream, she only let him stick the head in

Villain get the money like curls
They just tryin' to get a nut like squirrels in his mad world
Land of milk and honey with the swirls
Where reckless naked girls get necklaces of pearls
Compliments of the town jeweler
Left back now-schooler tryna sound cooler
On the microphone known as the crown ruler
Never lied to ma when we said we found the moolah
Five-hundred somethin' dollars layin' right there in the street
Huh, now let's try and get somethin' to eat
Then he turned four and started flowin' to the poor
That's about when he first started going raw
Kept the 'dro in the drawer
A rhymin' klepto who couldn't go up in the store no more
His life is like a folklore legend
Why you so stiff, you need to smoke more, bredren
Instead of trying to riff with the broke war veteran
Spliff made him swore he saw heaven he was seven
Yup, you know it, growin' up too fast
Showin' up to class with Moet in a flask
He ask the teacher if he leave will he pass
His girl is home alone, he tryin' to get the...
If you want a sip get a paper water fountain glass
How I'm 'posed to know where your mouth been last?
Hands so fast he can out-spin Flash
Known to smoke a whole mountain of hash to the ash
Boom-bash, leave the room with the stash
Assume it's in a smash, DOOM get the cash

"Great stuff"
"Yeah, this is— this is good"
"Great stuff"
"Ahh, Oh yeah"
*Applause*
Hold the cold one like he hold a old gun
Like he hold the microphone and stole the show for fun
Or a foe for ransom, flows is handsome
O's in tandem, anthem, random tantrum
Phantom of the Grand Ole Opry, ask the dumb hottie
Masked, pump-shotty—somebody stop me
Hardly come sloppy on a retarded hard copy
After rockin' parties, he departed in a jalopy
Watch the droptop papi
Known as the grimy limey, slimy—try me blimey
Simply smashing in a fashion that's timely
Madvillain dashing in a beat-rhyme crime spree
We rock the house like rock 'n' roll
Got more soul than a sock with a hole
Set the stage with a goal
To have the game locked in a cage getting shocked with a pole
Overthrow it like throwing Rover a biscuit
A lot of bitches think he's overly chauvinistic
Let go his dick if that's the case
Rats, what a waste, there's more cats to chase
Dogs. He got it like new powers
Woke up, wrote and spit the shit in a few hours
Sheesh! Been unleashed since the glee club
Had your fam saying, "Please make me a dub"
Well, since you ask kindly
Where he been behind the mask, who can't find me?
You're blind, in the wine zone, leave your mind blown
When he shine with the 9, he's a rhinestone…
Cowboy


No, no, no, no, enough
Goony goo-goo, loony cuckoo
Like Gary Gnu off "New Zoo Revue", but who knew
The mask had a loose screw? Hell, could hardly tell
Had to tighten it up like the Drells and Archie Bell
It speaks well of the hyper base
Wasn't even tweaked and it leaked into cyberspace
Couldn't wait for the snipes to place
At least a tracklist in bold print typeface
Stopped for a year
Come back with thumbtacks, pop full of beer
We're hip hop sharecroppers
Used to wear flip flops, now rare gear coppers
He's in it for the quiche
You might as well not ask him for no free shit, capiche?
Oh, my aching hands
From raking in grands and breaking in mic stands
Villain—his smile stuns ya chick
While he put himself in your shoes run ya kicks
You heard it on the radio, tape it
Play it in your stereo, your crew'll go apeshit
Raw lyrics—he smells 'em like a hunch
The same intuition that tells him "spike the punch"
Curses, he's truly the worsest
With enough rhymes to spread throughout the boundless universes
Let the beat blast, she told him wear the mask
He said you bet your sweet ass
It's made of fine chrome alloy
Find him on the grind, he's the rhinestone cowboy



Sometimes they were comedic— or relentlessly horrifying
They were the foes of society, whether fighting the local sheriff, or a secret agent
Frequently they mirrored our times: the gangster villains which rival real newspaper headlines of the present day
Collectively, they are the components which have fueled nightmares for decades to come

===== Madvillain - Great Day =====

It never really mattered too much to me
That I was just too damn old to emcee
All that really matters is if your rhymes was ill
Girl, that's all that really mattered to me, oh baby
Looks like it's gonna be a great day today
To get some fresh air like a stray on a straightaway
Hey you, got a light? Nah, a Bud Light
Early in the morning, face crud from like a mud fight
Looky here, it's just the way the cookie tear
Prepare to get hurt and mangled like Kurt Angle rookie year
The rocket scientist, with the pocket wine list
Some even say he might need some pus-sychiatrist
DOOM, are you pondering what I'm pondering?
Yes, but why would the darn thing be wandering?
She's like a foundling, barely worth fondling
My posse's on Broadway like Mama, I Want to Sing!
Mad plays the bass like the race card
Villain on the case to break shards and leave her face scarred
Groovy, dude! Not to prove to be rude
But this stuff is like what you might put on movie food
Uh, what is jalapeños?
Get it like a whoopin' when you holla at your seniors
Dolla he can overhear the hashish fienda
He just came from over there, the grass is greener
Last wish: I wish I had two more wishes
And I wish they fixed the door to the Matrix, there's mad glitches
Spit so many verses sometimes my jaw twitches
One thing this party could use is more—ahem...
Booze,put yourself in your own shoes
And stay away from all those pairs of busted Timbs you don't use
He only keep 'em to decorate
If you wanna peep 'em, select a date and bring a deep check, like checkmate
I kid you not, on the dotted line signed
Ever since a minor, kids considered him some kind of Einstein
On a diamond mine grind, she was dumb fine
But not quite the type that you might want to wine and dine
Couldn't find a pen, had to think of a new trick
This one he wrote in cold blood with a toothpick
On second thought it's too thick
His assistant said, "DOOM, you sick," he said, "True" through acoustics
Psycho, his flow is drowned in Lawry's seasoning
With micro power he's sound and right reasoning
It's easy as pi, 3.14
One more one false move and they're done for—

They stay...
Strange ways..."
Wreak havoc, beep beep it's mad traffic
Sleek and lavish people speak and leak it to the maverick
He see it as just another felony drug arrest
Any day could be the one he pick the wrong thug to test
Slug through the vest, shot in the street
For pulling heat on a father whose baby's gotta eat
And when they get hungry, it ain't shit funny
Paid to interfere with how a brother get his money
Now, who's the real thugs, killers and gangsters?
Set the revolution, let the things bust and thank us
When the smoke clear, you can see the sky again
There will be the chopped off heads of Leviathan

My friend, they call 'em strangers
Anybody talk to him end up in some danger
"They'll never change...
They stay...
Strange ways..."
Can't reform 'em

They pray four times a day, they pray five
Who ways is strange when it's time to survive
Some will go of they own free will to die
Others take them with you when they blow sky high
What's the difference? All you get is lost children
While the bosses sit up behind the desks, it cost billions
To blast humans in half, into calves and arms
Only one side is allowed to have bombs
It's like making a soldier drop his weapon
Shooting him, and telling him to get to stepping
Obviously, they came to portion up his fortune
Sounds to me like that old robbery/extortion

"They'll never change...
They stay..."
Same Game
"Strange ways..."
Ya can't reform 'em
...that Mary was goin' around with an old flame
That burned me up, because I know he was just feeding her a line!
But the guy really spent his money like water
I think he was connected, so I left
Outside it was raining cats and dogs
I was feelin' mighty blue... and everything looked black
But I carried on!

===== Madvillain - Money Folder =====

The villain took on many forms...

Let he who is without sin cast the first stone
After you, who's last? It's DOOM, he's the worst known
That'll have your boom blown or either thirst bone
Rock it to a worse clone, just don't curse the throne
Own his own microphone, bring it everywhere he go
So he can bring it to you live in stere-ere-o
Pan it, can't understand it, ban it
The underhanded ranted, planned it and left 'em stranded
The best, any who profess will be remanded
Yes sir, request permission to be candid? Granted
I don't think we can handle a style so rancid
He flipped it like Madlib, did a old jazz standard

Don't mind me, I wrote this rhyme lightly
Off of two or three Heines, and boy was they fine, G
One black, one Spanish, one Chinee'
It keeps the woody shiny year-round like a pine tree
Don't sign me, I'm about to get a mil' without 'em
Crowd him off the shelf, he's the villain, and what about him?
So, and he's a jerk and you don't know him
Mad how he expand work but won't show 'em
Poor guys, what a sight for old, sore four-eyes
Now hook me with two apple pies and a small fries
All rise, so far odd as a ruple
So raw, break it down and make quadruple
It's crucial, you could see it in his pupil
And this time when he get it he'll waste it on somethin' useful
Like getting juiced off a deuce-deuce of Coqui
Keep it low key, known to pull a okey-dokey
Silly Goose, DOOM is too jokey
Damn he could really use a room or a ho key
Egads, he got enough styles to start three fads
True dat, she bad, I wonder do she come with kneepads
What a call, what a real butterball
Either I get a strike or strike out, gutterball
Rock it like gear for the fall
With nice inside pockets, prepare for the brawl
Yeah y'all you could say its an earful
Beware, do not touch mic, be careful
And just like he said, I could'a told ya
MF, the holder of a boulder; money folder
It ain't funny, nigga
Money folder

The muscle-bound karate expert concealed a razor edge
Which could lop the head off of a marble statue once propelled
With notorious world takeover schemes and the most magnificent gadgets imaginable
Villains rapidly grew healthy cash flow
It is explained by a more comedic villain, the bald headed DOOM
This villain rose to incredible new heights of money-making, revenge and extortion
Such was the magnitude of the typical villain
This is no answer!
Very well then...
A duel to the death

65 ContributorsTranslationsРусскийRomânăEspañolPortuguêsThe Illest Villains Lyrics
"As luck would have it, one of America's two most powerful villains of the next decade— has turned loose to strike terror into the hearts of men"
*Grunting*
"...To shock women into uncontrolled hysteria"
*Woman shrieking*
"Don't touch that!"
"The villains themselves were ultimately responsible for much of the popularity, audiences loved to hate
The importance of the villain was not overlooked, of course one of the worst of all was Madvillain
They had no code of ethics"
"What's the matter? I was only tryin' to have fun—"
"Get to work on these boys, anybody bring a gun for me?"
"Yeah, here's one"
"Not one, but two!"— typical villain releases included...
—"I know they wanna kiss me, but don't let anyone see me like that, please doctor help me!"—
"And a sequel"

"Master of all—"
*Woman screaming*
"Both the villains were to meet in—"
"Your mother was the lightning!"
"Two historical figures, outlaws and desperadoes if that, the villainous pair of really nice boys who just happened to be on the wrong side of the law, three hundred and sixty degrees. In similar sequences, could not be defeated. Villains who possess supernatural abilities— villains who were the personification of carnage"
"Madvillain, more accurately, the dark side of our beings"
"Perhaps it is due to this seminal connection that audiences can relate their experience in life with the villains and their dastardly doings"

Because once upon a time there was a yesterday
Yesterday belongs to the dead
Because the dead belongs to the past
The past is yesterday
Today is the preview of tomorrow but for me
Only from a better and happier point of view
My point of view is the thought of a better or try
Reality, is today is eternity
The eternity of yesterday is dead
Yesterday is as one
The eternity of one is the eternity of the past
The past is once upon a time
Once upon a time is past
The past is yesterday- day
The past is yesterday- day
While we're searching for tomorrow

The music is different here, the vibrations are different
Not like planet Earth
Planet Earth sound of guns, anger, and frustration
There was no one to talk to on planet Earth
Who would understand
And set up, a colony here
The light of the past is the light which was
The wisdom of the past is the light of the past
The light of the future is the light which is to be
The wisdom of the future is the light of the future see
Yesterday belongs to the dead
Tomorrow belongs to the living
The past is certified as a finished product
Anything which has ended is finished
That which is perfect is finished
The perfect man is no exception to the rule
The perfect man of the past is made according to the rule of the past
The rule of the past is a law of injustice and hypocrisy
The revelation of the meaning of the law is revealed through the law itself
The wisdom of the past is the light of the past
The light which is to be the wisdom of the future
The light of the future casts the shadows of tomorrow

Effect their vibrations, for the better of course
Sun Ra
Sun Ra
Lord Quas
Madlib
Another place in the universe, up under different stars
That would be where the alter destiny would come in
Equation wise, the first thing to do is to consider time as officially ended
We'll wake on the other side of time

===== Madvillain - Operation Lifesaver aka Mint Test =====
61 ContributorsTranslationsРусскийRomânăEspañolOperation Lifesaver AKA Mint Test Lyrics
"The world is under attack at this very moment
By the most powerful forces man has ever seen!
Fate from the depths of the earth
'Operation: Lifesaver' is in effect, as of right now!"

Wow, it caught me off guard
I went to breathe out, but then she made me cough hard
Contact the God and let him know to slip two in
Fine, how are you doing?
Can I get you a drink? This one's a shoo-in
Awkward situation that I'm on a mission to ruin
Her big butt and smile was like camo
Hit up the men's room, we need more ammo ("Reload")
Watch your 3 o'clock, a new recruit
That's her gin and Juicy Juice, use a stick of Juicy Fruit
("Fire in the hole!") She just knew she was cute
It's in her own best interest
It's less stress, hit her with the "Do you need a mint?" test
It don't matter if she's slim or dressed to impress
I won't rest, fellas don't fess
Some of 'em just need to eat the whole thing of Crest
("In effect!") It's been a long day
It's just how the song say:
"'Operation: Lifesaver' is in effect, as of right now!"
I hope she don't take this the wrong way

"Are you ready? (Yeah)
Are you with it? (Yeah!)
Okay, let's go, you know what to do
The whole world's watching and counting on you
(You need a mint test)
(No! The beat stopped!)
And all you people listening out there
Everybody, everywhere
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!"
"The official adventures of—"
"The Magnificent— The Magnificent—"

Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Post me a pic, finna make me a profit
When the liquor hit, then a bitch get toxic
(Why the fuck you in the club when niggas wildin’?)
I've been lit since brunch, thot shit
Order '42 for the table, let’s pop shit
Missionary or doggystyle, I'ma top shit
Pussy-ass niggas hatin' on me from the closet, ah
Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
I don't give a fuck who talk behind my back
'Cause the bitch knew better than to let me hear her (Ah)

Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)
Hands on my knees, shakin’ ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, ha-hands on my knees
Hands on my knees, shakin’ ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)
Hands on my knees, shakin’ ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, hands on my knees

Hoes said they wish a bitch would, and I'm a genie
Bitch so hot, gotta stay in bikinis
He got a girl, but he keep beggin' to see me
I love it when a nigga got a mouth full of VVs
No, I'm not a patient, but I let him treat me
I gotta be a doctor how I’m orderin' CCs
Go to your place, no face, no case
Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it and still tryna drag me
Actin' like you winnin', if you think about it, actually
Are they supportin' you or really just attackin' me?
I don't give a fuck 'bout a blog tryna bash me
I'm the shit per the Recording Academy (Ah)
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, ha-hands on my knees
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, hands on my knees

Drinkin' out the motherfuckin' bottle on my thot shit
Everything I eat go straight to my pockets
2021, finna graduate college
Goth girl shit, I'm a real hot topic
Fuckin' on a nigga, make him sing, on some pop shit
I need a real headbanger, on some rock shit
Pussy like crack, wanna hit it like dope
Got a real hot box, but a bitch don't smoke (Ah)
Hot girl, but I'm still the coldest, hey
I'm the big homie, but I ain't the oldest, hmm
Bitch dry hatin', tryna get noticed
Man, ain't nobody come to see you, Otis, look
How many bitches lyin' if they say they bars is better?
They really puppets, so I really gotta go and Geppetto
I'm really talkin', but it really can apply to whoever
My pen a freak, it'll go after a bitch or a nigga (Huh)
Big bank take lil' bank, bitch, add it up
Hoes takin' shots, but they ain't in my caliber
Booked, but I squeeze a lil' head in my calendar
Lookin' in the mirror like, "Damn, I don't brag enough"
LVs, double C's, Birkins, I'm workin'
My chain ain't hittin' if a bitch ain't hurtin'
Look, I ain't even finna argue with a bitch
One thing I know, two things for certain
None of these hoes sayin' shit to my face
And none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
And I'ma keep talkin' all the shit that I want
And I dare one of these hoes come tell me I can't
We ain't even speakin' if the nigga ain't spendin'
He could never say that I was one of his women
I don't even let niggas know where I stay
I'll be damned if he thinkin' he poppin' up on this pimpin' (Ah)

Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit (Thot shit)
Hands on my knees, shakin' ass, on my thot shit

That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby
Her friends and mom hate me (Go)
Lay down on the bed, do the crybaby (Mmm)
She ain't gave me none of that pussy in a while
She had the boy waitin', I don't mind waitin' (Come here)
Oh, you ain't gon' respond to my texts? (Oh, yeah?)
Want me keep on my diamonds, we sex? (What's your name?)

Keisha? (Kei), Jasmine? (Jas), Kiera? Megan? (Go)
Lisa? Ashley? (Ashley), Sierra? Sarah?
She got her hands on her knees with her ass in the air, ooh, that lil' bitch a player
If her friends ain't around to record it, she bend over, shake that lil' ass in the mirror
Like goddamn, what a nigga gotta do for your number?
Shawty came through with that head so good, I said fuck it, I ain't usin' no rubber
Way she make that ass bounce, think I love her
Got that ass and that mouth from her mother
Type to make your bae mad, you in trouble
NBA playoffs that ass, it's a bubble
Uh-uh, uh-uh, come here, come here, uh-uh
Throw that ass back, come here, come here

That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby
Her friends and mom hate me (Go)
Lay down on the bed, do the crybaby (Go)

Choke me, spank me, look at me, thank me (Thank me)
If I give it to another nigga, he'll hate me (He'll hate me)
Spit, slurp, give him that work
Fell too fast for me, now the nigga hurt
Deeper, deeper, I need a reaper
Thought I was in trouble how he tearin' them cheeks up
Keep me a freak, who the flavor of the week?
If I make up the rules, then I don't think it's cheatin'
Jordan, Tommy, Timothy, Daniel (Which one?)
Might let Jonathan bring in Sarah (Come here, Sarah)
Bitch tryna brag about taking my man (Huh?)
Hah, I needed me a nigga off my hands (Hahahaha)
Uh-uh, don't fuck me like that, fuck me like this, yeah, ayy

And if the beat live, you know Lil Ju made it

Big-ass chain 'round my neck so these niggas know I'm rich and I don't need shit but the dick
Big-ass stack in this purse so these niggas know I'm workin', I'm holdin' this Glock in my Birkin
Niggas gotta hold that L tryna come for my pen, I'm really finna make another M
Now, tell me how the fuck I'm in the wrong if I don't want the nigga and he still ain't fuckin' with the bitch?

I be workin', I make moves in silence
Hoes might never like me and I'm fine with it
Nasty, I'm a real nigga fantasy
I'll drop dead 'fore a broke nigga handle me
D'USSÉ, this rich bitch energy
Y'all lil' hoеs still drinkin' that Hennessy
Messy, and I'm sick of y'all tryin' it
Bitch got rеceipts, but ain't never finna buy shit (Ah)

Sorry, hoes hate me 'cause I'm the it girl
I ain't never asked to be the shit, girl
Don't call me "sis", 'cause I'm not your sister
You really need to come and get your mister
Seein' all my opps linked up in a picture
Everybody look busted, injured
Stalkin' my page, bitch probably wanna scissor
All in her mouth like I kissed her

I be workin', I make moves in silence
Hoes might never like me and I'm fine with it
Nasty, I'm a real nigga fantasy
I'll drop dead 'fore a broke nigga handle me
D'USSÉ, this rich bitch energy
Y'all lil' hoes still drinkin' that Hennessy
Messy, and I'm sick of y'all tryin' it
Bitch got receipts, but ain't never finna buy shit

Bad bitches run in my pack, gang shit
Cartier frames, spot a bitch on some lame shit
Broke niggas all in my way, clear 'em
Chains ain't makin' no noise? They ain't big enough
Wildin', on a boat on an island
When I throw it back, bet I make him throw the towel in
I got a nigga, but I don't need one
He fuck up, I'ma have my fun
Teacup, I can fit a bitch in my purse
Which one of y'all wanna go first?
Spicy, ain't a bitch out built like me
I run shit, probably how I got a deal with Nike
Beefin'? You just mad we ain't speakin'
And I'm the one that put the roof where you sleepin'
Phoney, I don't need no new homies
I'm the reason all of my opps ain't homeless (Ah)

All them hoes wanna look like me (Look like me)
Bitch most likely, only fuckin' you just to spite me (Ayy, ayy, just to spite me)
But please don't get it twisted, I ain't trippin'
I never put my faith in a nigga, bitch, I'ma die independent
If you was wonderin', yeah, boy, I'm still that bitch (Still that bitch)
I had to block you, but you still gotta watch this shit
'Cause who the fuck rock it like me? No bra, tight tee (Hey)

Damn, I can't believe I used to let you fuck me (Let you fuck me)
I'd rather be in jail before a broke nigga cuff me (Ayy, ayy)

Ladies, love yourself, 'cause this shit could get ugly (Shit could get ugly)
That's why it's, "Fuck niggas, get money" (Fuck niggas, get money)
And I don't give a fuck if that nigga leave tonight
Because, nigga, that dick don't run me (Ayy, that dick don't run me)
You better get on your knees and eat this pussy right
Before I have another nigga do it for me
Because dick don't run me, I run dick
Nigga, yeah, you's a bitch (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Mugler suit in my meetin' (Yeah), Wagyu steak when I'm eatin' (Ah)
Makin' so much money, this nigga dumb if he's cheatin' (Dumb if he's cheatin')
Bitches watchin' and hatin' (Yeah), put that shit in they faces (Shit in they faces)
I'll buy the whole buildin' and keep them hoes in they places (Hey, hey, woah)
He submerged in it (Yeah), like a baptism (Like a baptism)
He hit this water, then he comin' back a real nigga (Ah, ah)
How you want a bitch (Yeah), but don't wanna work? (But don't wanna work)
How you want a bitch that you don't deserve?
I should have listened to my first mind
And told your ass "No" the first time (Told your ass "No" the first time)
Tried to spare this nigga feelings, now he think he hurtin' mine (Ayy)
You're cheap and I be at work while you sleep (While you sleep)
My pussy is the most expensive meal you'll ever eat (You'll ever eat)
Fuck you, still can't believe I used to trust you (Used to trust you)
The only accolade you ever made is that I fucked you
You a bitch, if you get the chance, I bet you snitch
You'll never get a chance to tell me come and pack my shit (Ah)

Ladies, love yourself, 'cause this shit could get ugly (Shit could get ugly)
That's why it's, "Fuck niggas, get money" (Fuck niggas, get money)

You better get on your knees and eat this pussy right

===== Megan Thee Stallion - Her =====
50 ContributorsTranslationsPolskiHer Lyrics
I don't care if these bitches don't like me
'Cause, like, I'm pretty as fuck

Just the other day, I heard a ho say
Matter of fact, what could a ho say?
With a face like this and a bitch this paid
Shit, what could a ho say?
The bag so expensive, my pussy came with it
Body so nice, they be sayin', "Who did it?"
But everything natural, actual, factual
Prissy in the streets, but I fuck like an animal
All you hoes know who the fuck I am
From your boyfriend down to my Instagram
To all them busted-ass hoes that you kiki with
I bet your jaw drop if you ever see me, bitch

I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her (Ah)

Bitch, you do you and whatever that is, I'ma do it better
Hoes must've just seen me and they playin' catch-up
Bitches lookin' like lil' Megans playin' dress-up
Would I ever spin the block on a nigga? Never
I don't even wear an outfit twice, dead 'em
Any bitch got a problem? Probably never met 'em
Tell a hater kiss both cheeks, ciao, bella
But I'm used to the chatter 'cause

I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her (Ah)

All this hate givin' me a pretty face
I eat hate, that's why I ain't got a waist
The more hoes hatin', more money I'ma make
And the more niggas talk, more niggas want a taste
'Cause I'm the most sickenin', hoes so fuckin' sick of me
No matter what they do or say, it ain't no gettin' rid of me
I come in every room and draw attention like a centerpiece
Steppin' for a long time, movin' like a centipede
I ain't scared of shit, man or a bitch
To everybody hatin', y'all can suck this clit
'Cause the hate campaign ain't workin' at all
I ain't Jack or Jill, bitch, I ain't gon' fall

I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her (Ah)

It ain't always about what you like, sometimes it's about what's right
Helluva made this beat, baby
Huh

I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)

Why you wanna play with me? You know I'm undefeated
A real hot girl know how to keep a nigga heated
You say you want respect, well, treat me how you wanna be treated
You told me keep it real, but you don't practice what you preachin'
You want me to blow your phone up and come a-lookin' for you 'til I find ya
You really want me to whoop the ho that you fuckin' with if I find her
Bitch, you ain't that busy, I don't give a fuck what you ain't got time for
You look me in my eyes and know you lying, man, that's fraud, bruh
Man, you knew I was a player 'fore you met me, need to relax
You know that you gon' hate me if I get to playin' get-back
I ain't turn into no bad bitch when you met me, boy, I been that
You tryna make me somethin' that I ain't, and I ain't with that (Nah)

I got my mind on gettin' paid, we ain't spoke in some days
He probably thinkin' I'm in pain, but I'm really on game
Ain't no nigga finna stop me, independent, I got me
All the shit that I be needin', can't depend on a "probably"
And that's fucked up, 'cause you know that I don't fuck with nobody
I be quiet, but you out here tellin' stories, one-sided
I ain't perfect and I try to fix the shit that ain't workin'
But it's 2020, I ain't finna argue 'bout twerkin'
Since you wanna test them waters, might as well jump in with both feet
If you leave me and you see me, better act like you don't know me
If you think this shit get better with another bitch, go get her (Go and get her)
When you realize she ain't got you like I got you, I can't help ya
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)

Listen up, everyone
We have been just informed that there's an unknown virus that's attacking all clubs
Symptoms have been said to be
Heavy breathing, wild dancing, coughing
So when you hear the sound "hootie hoo"
Run for cover, motherfucker

Mm (Woo)
Oh, daddy
Oh (Ooh)
Oh (Ah, woo)
Pass that Dutch (Ah), pass that Dutch (Ooh)
Pass that Dutch (Ah), pass that Dutch (Ah)
Pass that Dutch (Ah), pass that Dutch (Ah)
Pass that Dutch (Woo), pass that Dutch

Misdemeanor on the floor, pretty boy, here I come
Pumps and a bump make you wanna hurt somethin'
I can take your man, I don't have to sex 'em
Hang 'em out the window, call me Michael Jackson (Hee)
I'm a pain in your rectum
I am that bitch y'all slept on
Heavy hitter, rhyme spitter, call me Rerun
Hey, hey, hey, I'm what's happenin'
Hpnotiq in my drink (That's right)
Shake ya ass 'til it stink (That's right)
Mr. Mos' on the beat (That's right)
Put it down for the streets (That's right)

(Hootie hoo) Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch (Come on, pass the Dutch, baby)
Shake, shake, shake ya stuff, ladies
(Hootie hoo) Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pop that, pop that, jiggle that fat
Don't stop, get it 'til ya clothes get wet

Number one, drums go bump, bump, bump
This beat here will make your pum pum jump
If you's a fat one, put your clothes back on
Before you start putting pot holes in my lawn
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
I'm under attack like my name was Saddam
I am the bomb from New York to Milan
And I can write a song sicker than Jeffrey Dahm'
(Whoop-whoop) Who touched my car alarm?
Break in my car, you will hear "Viper armed"
I've been a superstar since Daddy Kane was raw
I'm live on stage, c'mon and give me some applause

Thank you
Oh, thank you, you all are so wonderful

(Hootie hoo) Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch (Come on, pass the Dutch, baby)
Shake, shake, shake ya stuff, ladies

Listen up, motherfuckers
You have five seconds to catch your breath
Five, four, three, two, one

Pop that, pop that, make that money
Just keep it going like the Energizer Bunny
Shake that, shake that, move it all around
Spank that, yank that, Dutch back now
Freak him, freak her, whatever your choice
Didn't come to judge, I came to get ya moist
Scream "hootie hoo" now my voice is lost
Can I get a ride on the white horse?

(Hootie hoo) Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch
Pass that Dutch, pass that Dutch (Come on, pass the Dutch, baby)
Shake, shake, shake ya stuff, ladies

(Shorty what?)
The dance that you doing is dumb
How they do it where you from? (Ayy!, Triflin'!)
Stickin' out your tongue
Girl, but you know you're too young
A bunch of girls do it and the shit look fun
That's how they do it where we from (Ayy!)
You know it don't start till one
That's how they do it where they from

I'm so faded, no exaggeration (What?)
Backs breakin' like a percolation (What?)
Boys to the yard for some hip spankin'
Where you make it drop down like you in the matrix (Yeah!)
Can't take it, them chicks been fakin' (What?)
Y'all still sleep, better stay awakened (What?)
Hot new dance for the hood to make it
Make the donk move fast, make them think you drinkin' (Yeah!)
Head to the floor don't collect that though (What?)
You better huddle up cause the beat's so cold (Huh?)
Pop that, pop that, cock and reload (Huh?)
This another hit, I got an ace in the hole (What?)
Boys on my back, playa, did you peep that?
You got a small stack, playa, you can keep that (Huh?)
I'm a Big Mac make you wanna eat that
Like m-m-m-m-m, yak it to the yak (Yeah?)
Junk in the trunk make you pumps in the bump
Girls wanna have fun make you stickin' out your tongue (What?)

Shorty what?
The dance that you doing is dumb
How they do it where you from?
Stickin' out your tongue girl
But you know you're too young
A bunch of girls do it and the shit look fun
That's how they do it where we from
You know it don't start till one
That's how they do it where they from

I come into this bitch like liquid
Drip, drip, then the business
Click, click, get your picture
Hermés Trismegistus
Witness and get lifted
Basic, nigga I was born in the basement
Shape shift, nigga, I think like a spaceship
False, oh-nah-nah-nah
I am so different than y'all, so far apart
The way that I balance the bars
I never fall, and if I do I just call
The almighty yellow star, God
Lyrically I'm Optimus Prime
The car I drive; La FER-RAR-I
When I go by, smoke in your eyes
So open your eyes, the joke's on you guys
And you ain't gotta be a mason to see through
Some of this shit on occasion

Shorty what?
The dance that you doing is dumb
How they do it where you from?
Stickin' out your tongue, girl
But you know you're too young
A bunch of girls do it and the shit look fun
That's how they do it where we from
You know it don't start till one
That's how they do it where they from

I'm like kak-a-rak-a-rak-rak-a-rak-a-rak
Make a new track, make 'em fall on they crack
Give 'em a slap, appetizer and smack
I'm so fat in the back, make the boys all collapse
Yeah, when I rap they be all on my jack
Boys wanna jump on this pussy cat (Prrrr)
Got a new idea, let me switch it
Man, I'm so futuristic
Big lips and big, big, big hips
Body be thick like a biscuit
Different, rippin' shit, microphone grippin' it
Gettin' these Benjamins, new car, whippin' it
Uh, I'm so far ahead of ya'll, man I'm on top of the stars
I don't care none of you are, blah-blah-blah-blah
You best to go rewrite your bars

Shawty what?
How they do it where you from? (Triflin'!)
How they do it where you from?
That's how they do it where we from
That's how they do it where they from
Shawty what?
How they do it where you from? (Hey!)
How they do it where you from?
That's how they do it where we from
That's how they do it where they from

We so tight, that you get our styles tangled
Sway or do-si-do like you loco (Uh-huh)
"Can we get kinky tonight?" Like Coko, so-so

Yo, yo yo move out of the wayWe got Missy Elliott coming through
Girl, that is Missy Elliott she lost a lot of weight
I heard she eat one cracker a day
Girl, well I heard the bitch was married to Tim' and started fuckin' with Trina
I heard the bitch got hit by three zebras and a monkey
I can't stand the bitch no way

When I walk up in the piece
I ain't gotta even speak
I'm a bad mamajama
Goddammit, motherfucker, you ain't gotta like me
How you stuntin' these hoes?
Need to talk, what you know
And stop talkin' 'bout who I'm stickin' and lickin'
Just mad it ain't yours
I know y'all poor, y'all broke
Y'all job just hangin' up clothes
Step to me, get burnt like toast
Motherfuckers, adios, amigos
Hop, hop, pose, pose

Chickenheads on the prowl

Better calm down 'fore I smack your ass down

Just wanna see who I am ****, boy sniffing some coke
I know by the time I finish this line, I'ma hear this on the radio

Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind, no one gave a shit
Knowin' he could rap, no one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
Fifty thousand sold, seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone, three years later
Stepped out the swamp in ten-and-a-half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smellin' like Burberry cologne
Still ridin' chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen, never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect, you'll give me
Ludacris, I live loud like Timmay (Uh)
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache, and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head tucked tight
Sprayed, so I never let the bedbugs bite
Hard to the core, core to the rotten
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton

A hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last

It's all in your mind, punk, so keep your head tight
Enough with tips and advice and thangs

They go to sleep, start snorin', countin' sheep and shit
They so wet that they body start to leak and shit

I was looking for affection, so I decided to go
Swing that dick in my direction, I'll be out of control
Let's take it to perfection, just you and me
Let's see if you can bring, bring, bring the nasty out of me, n-n-n-now sock it

Ooh ahh, sock it to me like you want to, ooh (Oh)
I can take it like a pro, you know (Know)
Do it long throw with the back stroke (Hey)
My hormones jumping like a disco (Hey)
I be popping mess like some Crisco
All you gotta say is "Missy, go"
And when you say go, I won't move slow (Slow)

I'm at your house around midnight (Midnight), don't fall asleep
It'll just be me-me-me on a late night creep

Jump in this B-E-D, and won't you sock it to me? S-S-S-Sock it to me

Ooh ahh, sock it to me like you want to, ooh (Sock it to me)

Why Missy be socking it to niggas like Ree-Ree?
The baddest industry bitches of the century
Hit hard like penitentiary dick
Finally admitted that we the shit, combination is lethal
Popping Patrón with Missy in the 600 with no see-through
Suffer the repercussion fucking with shit like this
We parlay puffing
Constantly making niggas suffer the consequence
Gotta get these ends, bitch
House in the Chi with a Caddy, crib in Atlanta with a Benz
Niggas been huffing and puffing but ain't try shit
Got plenty motherfuckers that'll ride quick
Besides, kid wanna bust?
Trigger finger itch when you fucking with me
Jealous because I live more plush
Me and Missy leave a nigga with a head rush
Bring the ruckus, plus
I'm telling 'em, push and pickin' up profits
For what I'm selling, never gon' stop it
Socking it to niggas and rocking it
Dropping 'em on the spot
Heat up any block or record shop
Knocking you off of your socks
Guaranteed Platinum, watch two of the coldest bitches get hot
I be the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
We some bad bitches who be fucking it up
I'm the B-R-A-T, her be Missy
And we some bad bitches who be fucking it up

I'm your nigga for life, baby, haha
Let's continue to drive all these motherfuckers crazy
You know what I'm saying? Yeah
Timbaland, I see you, baby
I feel you, uh, sock it to 'em, goddammit
It's '97, this the motherfuckin' bitch era
What y'all niggas wanna do?
The Brat-tat-tat on that ass once more, uh
I'm out the door, motherfucker, yeah, uh

Boy, I'ma make you love me, make you want me
And I'ma give you some attention tonight (Shut up)
Now follow my intuitions, what you're wishin'
See I'ma keep you up all night (All night), for a long time, so start countin' away

Get your oil changed, I check fluids and transmission
You one minute fools, you wonder why y'all missin'
On the back of milk cartons and there's no reward
No regards, close, but it's no cigar
A hard head make a soft ass, but a hard dick make the sex last
I jump in pools and make a big splash
Water overflowin', so get your head right
It's all in your mind, punk, so keep your head tight
Enough with tips and advice and thangs
I'm big dog, havin' women seein' stripes and thangs
They go to sleep, start snorin', countin' sheep and shit
They so wet that they body start to leak and shit
Just 'cause I'm a all-nighter, shoot all fire
Ludacris, balance and rotate all tires

Ooh, I don't want, I don't need, I can't stand no minute man
I don't want no minute man
Ooh, here's your chance, be a man take my hand, understand
I don't want no minute man

Up in the club with speakers
Hi hats, some base and tweeters

Sweat 'til I catch a fever
Call me the illest diva
Yo, I'm on fire
People, go 'head and drink up
Get in the club, get fucked up
See me, you got get lucked up
Someone to touch and rub up
Show me some love, strip off your clothes
And take off your socks

The party's jumpin', I see something fine
Boy, I wanna kiss you, but I'm just too shy
Let me dance with you, let me wear you out
Here's a glass of orange juice, let's go X it out
The music's bangin' way down in my soul
When you dance behind me, I lose all control
Make me grind my hips, make me move my waist
Yo, when the music come on, you take my breath away

This is for my people, my party people
And this is for my people, my mother— people

Take me on the dance floor to feel some ecstasy

Cocky with his mouthpiece like he got a fan
Can't stand when a bitch all on my side

Givin' me the side eye like she wanna fight
Philly known for boxing, bitch, better get it right
Can't stand when a DJ fuckin' up the song

Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
Yeah, it's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm, I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a .9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers "Back up!" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, "Yo, my shit is stuck!"
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stock, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

===== Nas - If I Ruled the World (Imagine That) =====
162 ContributorsTranslationsРусскийIf I Ruled the World (Imagine That) Lyrics

Life
I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know
Imagine smokin' weed in the street without cops harassin'
Imagine goin' to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruisin' blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feelin' like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Troopin' outta state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin' fashion
Designer clothes, lacin' your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holdin' dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time, watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine"

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

The way to be: Paradise life, relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon, Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew — how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seein' things like I was controllin', clique rollin'
Trickin' six-digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, and reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa, Africa

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

And then we'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand (hand)
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land (land)
We'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand (hand)
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land (land)

You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin' from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Tryin' to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the Gat with the cocked hammer
Makin' moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
'Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga havin' shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it
Sky's the limit, I'd push a Q45 Infinit'
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies, or B Felony
Strictly livin' longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?!

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world (Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled
I'd free all my sons (Diamonds) (I love 'em, love 'em, baby)
Black diamonds and pearls
If I ruled, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
(I love 'em, love 'em, baby)

===== Nas - The Message =====
228 ContributorsTranslationsРусскийThe Message Lyrics

Fake thug, no love, you get the slug
CB4 Gusto, your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out
Montana way, the Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes, 32 shotguns
Regulate with my thuns, 17 rocks gleam from one ring
Then let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on Millenniums
20G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets—the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique with the semi TEC, who want it?
Diamonds I flaunt it, chickenheads flock, I lace 'em
Fried, broiled with basil, taste 'em
Crack they legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon? Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC, it won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep, sunk in the seat, tinted, with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street, you was wildin', talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga gravy mine, clanked him
What was he thinkin' on my corner when it's pay-me time?
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin, somethin' told me "Plug him!"
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped, son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came, askin' me my name, what the fuck?
I got stitched up, it went through, left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop, so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin', all he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The 'Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme, it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' L's, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war, niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together Uptown, coppin' the raw
But, uh—a thug changes, and love changes
And best friends become strangers (Word up)

Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
There ain't an army that could strike back

Thug niggas
Yo, to them thug niggas gettin' it on in the world, you know?
To them niggas that's locked down
Doin' they thing, survivin', ya know'm sayin'?
To my thorough niggas, New York and worldwide
Yo, to the Queensbridge Militia
'96 shit, The Firm clique
Illmatic, nigga, It Was Written though
It's been a long time comin'
Y'all fake niggas, tryin' to copy
Better come with the real though, fake-ass niggas, yo
(They throw us slugs, we throwin' them back, what)
Bring the shit, man! Live, man!
(Fuck that, son, word up) '96 shit

186 ContributorsNas Is Like Lyrics

(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like; Nas is like; Nas is like)
Umm, Premo, Nas
Yeah, yeah, yo
(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like)
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time a man is murdered — the beginnin' and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin' for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin' large, takin' it light
Pushin' big toys, gettin' nice, enjoyin' your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course, N-A-S are the letters that spell... (Nas, Nas, Nas)

Nas is like... life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like... half-man, half-amazin' (Uh)
No doubt!
Nas is like... life or death; I'm a rebel (Uh, uh)
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like... half-man, half-amazin' (Uh)
No doubt! (Uh)

(Nas is like...) Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
(Nas is like...) Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, After the Death, the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blastin' TEC's on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, ownin' acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes givin' fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise — thug or die
Makin' choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wonderin' why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is

Nas is like... life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like... half-man, half-amazin' (C'mon)
No doubt!
Nas is like... life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like... half-man, half-amazin'
No doubt! (Uh)

(Nas is like...) Sex to a nympho, but nothin' sweet
I'm like beef, bustin' heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learnin' somethin' deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies
I'm like all races combined in one man, like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like bein' locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feelin' of a millionaire spendin' a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down, and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in ya system every night, now

Nas is like... life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like... half-man, half-amazin'
No doubt!

Represent, represent

Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers
We all stare at the out-of-towners
(Ayo, yo, who that?) They better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure

Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up bless
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, buddha-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, god, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom, then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Barkim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love

Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
One time for your mothafuckin' mind
This goes out to everybody in New York
That's living the real fucking life in every projects, all over
To my man Big Will, he's still here
The 40 side of Vernon, my man Big L.E.S
Big Cee-Lo from the Dime, Shawn Penn, the 40 busters
My crew the shorty busters, the 41st side of Vernon posse
The Goodfellas, my man Cormega, Lakey the Kid
Can't forget Drawz, the Hillbillies
My man Slate, Wallethead, Black Jay, Big Oogie
Crazy barrio spot, (Big Dove), we rock shit a lot, PHD
And my man Preemo from Gang Starr

Fuck y'all crab-ass niggas though!

Bitch ass niggas! Bitch ass niggas!

Come to Queensbridge, motherfucker!
Yeah, yeah, let's bring it back

===== Nas - Hate Me Now =====
122 ContributorsHate Me Now Lyrics

Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am...
Feel me? Let's go

You can hate me now (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now (Uh)
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down

Do it now
Weak, jealous motherfuckers!
Do it now, do it now!

Don't hate me, hate the money I see (Yeah), clothes that I buy (Uh-huh)
Ice that I wear, flows that I try (C'mon)
Close your eyes (That's right), picture me rollin' sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that's swollen, the riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed, Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater (You the best, that's right)
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters (Haha)
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper (Watch this)
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence, for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gate dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens (Hah, picture that)
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate? Be my guest, I suggest –

Money is power, motherfucker
I got millions of thugs on salary!
Do it now!

You can hate me now (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now (Now) (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (Do it now) (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (C'mon) (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (C'mon)
You can hate me now (Do it now) (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now

Do it now! (I told you, do it now!)
Let's go

You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': "Nas a clever nigga, nothin' to play with"
Hate on me, I blew, but I'm the same OG
People warned me: "When you on top, there's envy"
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood, but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the street, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, hoe?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?

You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too! (Do it now!)

You can hate me now (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (Now) (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now (Do it now) (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (C'mon) (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (Uh) (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (Uh, uh)
You can hate me now (Do it now) (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now (Do it now)

I like this, I like the way this feels (Let's go)

It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows (Yeah)
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one (Right)
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board, until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause, my driver, niggas shot up my doors (That's right)
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks (You tried?)
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' 'em up (That's what you get)
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just the Theory Of Man
Became a monster, atop of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin' – c'mon!

(Yeah) (It won't stop)
You will never seen a nigga like me (It won't stop) ever in your life (You can hate me) (Never!)
And that's what you can't understand!

You can hate me now (C'mon) (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now (Do it now, do it now) (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (Do it now, do it now, niggas) (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (C'mon) (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (Hate me now)
You can hate me now (You can hate me now) (Hate me now)
You can hate me now (C'mon, niggas!) (You can hate me now)

You can hate me now (C'mon, niggas!) (You can hate me now)
But I won't stop now (Do it now! Get this shit over with!)
(But I won't stop now)
It ain't gon' never stop, niggas! (I can't stop... I can't stop...)

===== Nas - Get Down =====
101 ContributorsGet Down Lyrics
Get, get, get down!

Uh.. uh.. uh

New York streets, where killers'll walk, like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide, on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died; one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
"What you up to? The cops gon' bust you"
I was a teen, drunk off brew
Stumbled, I wondered if God sent him 'cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah, man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin' their little cooch
Gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, "Nobody leavin'
Everybody—"

Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous, so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's, double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch 'em
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool, but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A
See a dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, "Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play"
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered, and I knew the ho responsible
The nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight, they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him "I ain't fuckin' with you"
He responded, "Cool," but told me "Out here, this how motherfuckers—"

Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you really look at it
My folk against your folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody got to make a change

===== Nas - I Can =====
138 ContributorsI Can Lyrics
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be – b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun, 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be – b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV, like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful – some men be
Rapists – so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so?
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know?
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men, and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be – be–fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from Black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asians, Arabs, and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money, it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander The Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with Black faces
Shot up they nose, to impose, what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive, until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king!
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, "She's my Queeeeeen!"

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all

Save the music

===== Nas - Halftime =====
240 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsРусскийHalftime Lyrics

(Right... Right...)
Check me out, y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'ma ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'm a performer, strange, show the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime

(Right...) It's halftime
(Right...) A-yo, it's halftime
(Right...) It's halftime
(Right...) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react, never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise 'cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch "CHiPs", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap
I'm a professional, and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle, I see trial niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime

(Right...) It's halftime
(Right...) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right...) It's halftime
(Right...) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
But chill, pass to Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out

(Right...) It's still halftime
(Right...) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right...) '92, it's halftime
(Right...) Yo, police, police man, yo, let's get ghost
Halftime...

(Check that shit)
Aight, fuck that shit, word, word
Fuck that other shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
We gon' do a lil' somethin' like this, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Stay up on that shit)
Keep it on and on and on and on and
Know what I'm sayin'? Big Nas
Grand Wizard, God, what is it? (It's like)
Haha, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, go ahead, rip that shit, dunn

I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights and blight crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strapped
With my peeps that's into drug money market into rap
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' match, from craps to cee-lo
With side bets, so roll a deuce, nothin' below
(Peace, God) Peace, God, now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that, y'all

Now, let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queensbridge
Now, let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queensbridge
Now, let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queensbridge
Now, let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queensbridge

One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God
Check the prognosis — is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis; my razor embraces many faces
Your telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic, automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin' — some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say "Peace"
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real, watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

Now, let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queensbridge
Now, let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queensbridge
Now, let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queensbridge
Now, let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' outta Queensbridge

Comin' outta-a-a-outta-a-a-outta Queensbridge
The most dangerous MC is
Comin' outta-a-a-outta-a-a-outta Queensbridge
The most dangerous MC is
Comin' outta-a-a-a-a-outta Queensbridge
The most dangerous MC is
Comin' outta-a-a-a-a-a-outta Queensbridge
The most dangerous MC is
Me number one, and you know where me from

===== Nas - Street Dreams =====
133 ContributorsTranslationsРусскийStreet Dreams Lyrics

Uh, what, what, uh

Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothin' on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real, G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God's sake, what a nigga gotta do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings? (What, uh)

Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from bein' alcoholic
Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou' from bein' rich
But now, I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel, Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smokin' on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while I'm hoppin' in the drop-top BM'
Word is bond (Uh), son (What), I had that bitch down on my shit  (What, uh) like this (Word)

Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin' a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'ing, heard about them old timers OD'ing
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase, I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel, stressing to pull out of the heat, no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending, never holding out
(Uh, what, what, uh)

Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

Fuck Jay-Z
What's up, niggas?
Ayo, I know you ain't talkin' about me, dawg (You? What?)
Fuck Jay-Z
You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Fuck Jay-Z
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already (Uh)

Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like a AIDS test, what's the results?
Not positive, who's the best, Pac, Nas and B.I.G.?
Ain't no best, east, west, north, south, flossed out
Greetings, I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest, face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage (Uh)
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne
I got this locked since '91 (Uh), I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music, check it

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly (Haha)
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already (Uh)

Ayo, pass me the weed (Tsk, there you go)
Put my ashes out on these niggas, man (Ain't no doubt)
Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel and kiss the motherfuckin' ring
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (Uh)
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishin' (Bitch niggas), friendly-actin', envy-hidin' snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef (What?)
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel (Haha) and his soldiers I can handle
This for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made a album called Blueprint (Dick)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G., dick-suckin' lips (Ha)
Why don't you let the late, great veteran live?

I will
Not lose (God's son across the belly, I'll prove you lost already), uh
The king is back
Where my crown at? (Ill Will)
Ill Will, rest in peace, let's do it, niggas

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I'll still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn, though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow (Burn slow)
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy (Ill)
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all tryna take my spot, fellas?
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now 'cause of your looks? (Girls, girls, girls, haha)
Negro, please, ha, you no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans, you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane, to Irv, to B.I.G
And Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons, ha
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn, you on Jaz dick
So little Shawny's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips? (Nigga)
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss

===== Nas - Affirmative Action =====
176 ContributorsAffirmative Action Lyrics
This is what.. this what they want, huh?
This is what it's all about, word
Time to take affirmative action, son
They just don't understand, you know what I mean?
Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
You know what I mean?
Niggas don't understand the four devils:
Lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact, sip your Cognac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler!
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break, undress 'em, tie 'em with tape
No escape, the Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
Aristocrats politickin' daily wit' diplomats
See, me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on a ki of heroin
They found his head on the couch wit' his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out!
Yo! The smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up
Bring your heater, all your C.R.E.A.M. go between us
Real shit! My Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill wit' niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
'Mega — the pretty boy with Mafia connections
It's The Firm, nigga, set it!

Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just' wake
It's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate
And now the projects is talkin' that "Somebody gotta die" shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so Hellfire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars, meetin' Foxy at Demars, movin' cars
Your top papi Señor Escobar

In the black Camaro, Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabees be the apparel through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In a Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E-Moneybags got Moët Chandon, bundle of 62
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a phat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera; be The Firm, baby!
From BK to the 'Bridge, my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Cristy
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uh!
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods — they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on, my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke, nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla, we gotta flee to Panama
But wait — it's half-and-half, ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16, double it, times 3
We got 48, which mean a whole lot of C.R.E.A.M
Divide the profit by 4, subtract it by 8, we back to 16
Now add the other 2 that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki, then that's more for me
Mad coke and mad leak plus a 500, cut in half is 250
Now triple that — times 3, we got three quarters of another ki

The Firm, baby, Vol. 1, uh!

===== Nas - Purple =====
103 ContributorsPurple Lyrics
Light it, uhh
Light it up, uhh

The whole city is mine, prettiest Don
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers
Why it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it
It's just an intro, hate it or love it, like it, bump it, or dump it
Write it across the stomach, spell "God's Son"
Life is like a jungle, black, it's like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggas packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, MAC strong, couple of shots
Made the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' their place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible?
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you, layin' low with a bottle
I'm blowin' circles, my state of mind purple

Light it, light it, uhh
Yeah... light it up
Light it up, uh

Y'all just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggas who've got things, y'all ready to kill his mama
Everything you into is underworld related
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin' soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind their shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground, but you
Still standin', still roamin' through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you, even now, that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you, but behind your back, they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love, it's hate – think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead, they tell 'em how to reach through the bars–holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tier in jail, makin' weapons to kill ya
Weed smoke, three tokes, nigga, pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood, blowin' smoke, state of mind is purple

Light it up, light it up, light it up, uhh
Light it up… light it up, light it up, uhh
Uhh… uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh

These hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble
Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor, and diamonds, niggas rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward to blow up, so what's the science?
People shoutin', police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in?
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
It's usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide-and-fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
And Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness
Too much of anything'll hurt you, so my state of mind's all purple

(Uh, uh, uh)

Now, let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment – a song y'all can step with
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldiers, survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly, and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe, so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless – say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem – put your hand up that you shoot with
Count your loot with, push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid
King of the town? Yeah, I been that
You know I click-clack where you and your mens at
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop, like we bringin' '88 back

They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

This ain't rappin', this is Street Hop
Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot
My live niggas – lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers, and killers can move swift
Girls, get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

Bravehearts, Bravehearts…
Bravehearts, Bravehearts

I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight ya punk asses
Like Pun said, "You ain’t even en mi clase"
Maybach Benz, back seat, TV, plasma
Ladies lookin' for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is
Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest

And I like a little sassiness, a lot of class
Mami, reach in your bag – pass the fifth
I'm a leader at last – this a don you with
My 9's will spit, niggas lose consciousness

===== Nas - As We Enter =====
96 ContributorsAs We Enter Lyrics

As we enter
Come now, we take you on the biggest adventure
Must be dementia, that you ever thought you could touch our credentials
What's the initials? Q.B., Jamrock — the lyrical officials
Send out the order, laws and the rituals
Burn candles, say prayers, paint murals
It is truth, we big news, we hood heroes
Break past the anchor, we come to conquer
Man a badman, we no play Willy Wonka
And I got the guns, I got the ganja
And we could blaze it up on your block if you wanna
Or haze it up, stash-box in a Hummer
Or you could run up, and get done up
Or get somethin' that you want none of
Unlimited amount you collect from us, direct from us, street intellectuals
And I'm shrewd about decimals
And my man'll speak Patois, and I can speak rap star
Y'all feel me, even if it's in Swahili
Habari Gani, Mzuri Sana
Switch up the language, I move through Ghana
Salute and honor real revolution rhymers
Rhythm piranhas like two Obamas
Unfold the drama!

Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong here to turn it out
Body the verses 'til they scream "Murder!" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain when dude comin'
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on, or move on it

Queens to Kingston
Gunshot we use and govern the kingdom
Rise of the Winston
I can see the fear up in your eyes, realize you can die any instant
And I can hear the sound of your voice
When you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen
Snitchin', I can see him pissin' on hisself
And he's wettin' up his thighs and he tryin' to resist it
Switchin', I can smell him diggin' up shit like a fly
Come around and be persistent
That's how you end up in a hit list
In a badman business
No evidence, crime scene fingerprint-less
Flow effortless, casual like the weekends
No pressure when we're comfy and decent
We set this off beastin', huntin' season
And, frankly speakin'

Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong came to turn it out
Body the verses 'til they scream "Murder!" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain when dude comin'
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on, or move on it
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong came to turn it out
Body the verses 'til they scream "Murder!" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain when dude comin'
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on, or move on!

Ain't no back and forth, ain’t no left or right (21, 21)
I got King's Disease but I move like a knight (21, 21)
Rappers bandwagon tryna get some likes (21, 21)
I do it for the fam', never for the hype (21, 21)
When you turn to legend, no such thing as relevance (21, 21)
They must’ve forgot that I'm a new rapper that got integrity (21, 21)
All in the media and blogs, that's just a place I don't care to be (21, 21)
Most of these niggas wouldn't say shit if they was ahead of me (Hit-Boy)

No back and forth, I did it back then, I do it right now (Woo)
I opened a lane for my era, I'm GOAT-ed, they gavе me the crown
GOAT with all the succеss, the negative press, I'm watchin' it pile (Uh)
They sayin’ that Black music dyin’, I'm sayin’ they wipin' us out
But look at me now, damn, y'all, look at me now
Whatever I do is N.Y., I'm keepin’ it Queens 'cause that's my side (What up?)
I shook up the town, I shook up the city, I shook up the state
I'm with 21 on my second run, this shit come with age

It's a conversation (Woo), it's determination (Yeah)
Your interpretation, I just shocked the nation (Oh)
Did my tour with The Wu, I came back and I set the pace (Woah)
They just ran in one of my cribs and took what? I replaced it (Haha)
Two Caucasians, saw part of they faces
Most of y'all assumed that they was Black, it's exploitation (Black Caesar)
They ain't know that I see everything, invested in Ring
It's cool to be mainstream, I'd rather be timeless
That's if we keepin' it P, 21 (21, 21)

I'm on that same trajectory
Bullet wounds and jail cells couldn't stop me, this my destiny
Never controversial, I'm mad the fans expected less from me
Nigga sneeze around me, wipe his nose, won't get no bless from me
Fuck the jewelry, I rather buy land and invest successfully
I got all type of stocks and bonds, Kehinde Wiley on my wall
And I'ma pass it to my son
If Savage like the capo that mean Escobar the don, one mic, one gun
My net worth like eight figures, I'm workin' on gettin' me nine
You know that I'm one of them niggas, I ain't doin' no cappin' or lyin'
You rappers be chasin' the hype, I do it and I don't be tryin'
I ain't goin' against no legend, nigga, I'm tryna be next in line
They actin' like I just popped, I was Platinum before I signed
I went Platinum without no features, I put platinum on your mind
This Glock I got two-tone, and this bitch don't bust no rhyme
They wanna see me fucked so they could deport me like I'm Shyne

No back and forth, I did it back then, I do it right now (Woo)
They tellin' me that I'm the G-O-A-T, I been here for a while
GOAT, love me today, hate me tomorrow, no switchin' my style
21, Yak, y'all get together, be big for the South (The globe)
But look at me now, damn, y'all, look at me now (Uh)
Whatever I do is New York, you hear that shit all in my vowels (Grrt)

But when that's over, then I'm first in line

We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sittin' down on that big butt
But I was still starin' at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston, Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you

Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it

So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns

Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothin' but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Young Mula, baby!
Nothin' but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

312 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisPolskiPortuguêsTürkçeAnaconda Lyrics
My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keepin' me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had 'em pushin' daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way, what he say? (Hey, hey)
He can tell I ain't missing no meals (Hey)
Come through and fuck him in my automobile (Hey)
Let him eat it with his grills, he keep tellin' me to chill
He keep tellin' me it's real, that he love my sex appeal (Hey)
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab (Hey)
So I pulled up in the Jag and I hit him with the jab like (Hey)
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun (Hey, hey)

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt (Oh-oh-oh)
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Look at her butt, look at, look at, look at
Look at her butt

This dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talkin' 'bout Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he callin' me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way, what he say? (Hey, hey)
He can tell I ain't missing no meals (Hey)
Come through and fuck him in my automobile (Hey)
Let him eat it with his grills, he keep tellin' me to chill
He keep tellin' me it's real, that he love my sex appeal (Hey)
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab (Hey)
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like (Hey)
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun (Hey, hey)

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh-oh-oh, oh my gosh, look at her butt
Look at her butt, look at, look at, look at
Look at her butt

Little in the middle, but she got much back
Little in the middle, but she got much back
Little in the middle, but she got much back
Oh my God, look at her butt

Ayo, look like I'm goin' for a swim
Dunked on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court fully drenched
Here go some haterade, get ya thirst quenched
Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench (Brrr)
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot
Oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc (By the rock)
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he buy the rock

Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed
He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song
I-I-I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ayo, I been north, Lara been Croft
Plates say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off

Oh, I get it, huh, they paintin' me out to be the bad guy
Well it's the last time you gonna see a bad guy do the rap game like me

I went and copped the chopsticks, put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit, box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip
How many of them coulda did it with finesse?
Now everybody like, "She really is the best"
You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong
Bitch, it's King Kong, this is King Kong
Chinese ink on, Siamese links on
Call me 2 Chainz, name go ding dong
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, I'm King Kong
This is King Kong? Yes, Miss King Kong
In my kingdom wit' my Timbs on
How many championships? What? Six rings on

They need rappers like me
They need rappers like me
So they can get on their fucking keyboards
And make me the bad guy, Chun-Li

Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on

He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song

Ayo, tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we 'bout to get lifted
Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes, though

I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time

The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly)
The night is still young (And watch the world pass us by?)
The night is still young (How dare we sit quietly?)
So are we

Ayo, drinks on you, or the drinks is on me?
We ain't goin' nowhere like tanks is on E
We still gettin' money, what bank it's gon' be?
If he's sexy, he plankin' on me
So where them big boys with all of that? (Ayy)
Tell the bartender, say my order back (Ayy)
It's bottle service, he ordered that (Ayy)
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leavin' 'til we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day (Day)
So drop the pop and get low
And we could drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is "Don't lose," kyuh (Oh)

I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time

I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about it are talkin' blunt and stayin' blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some stepsisters fuck each other
Woo, talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man, she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What? Tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

You know, yeah

Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper for the record
Man, this the sixty-five millionth single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, what's up? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now? Uh
Do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss every day, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach I invented
And I ain't takin' that back 'cause I meant it (Yeah)

Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the mornin'
'Cause she gon' say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl
This my new dance move, I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancin' with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie, you know

I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slay Goliath with a sling
This very moment, I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens, and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of (Yeah)
Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of

I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

What I tell them hoes? Bow, bow, bow to me, drop down to your knees
Young Money the mafia, that's word to Lil' Cease
I'm in the Dominican, Big Papi Ortiz
Doing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout out to the CEO, 500 Degreez
Shout out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year? We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll
These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top, and that nigga ain't even home yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And all you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies, but not everybody lives, ah

I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

This is my moment
I waited all my
Life, I can tell it's time
Drifting away, I'm
One with the sunsets
I have become alive

I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

Uh, who wanna play with Nicki?
Got the power, I could tell my niggas, "Spray like 50"
Distribute about a million dollars worth of brickies
Told 'em to keep fifty, my cut nine-fifty, bitchy

Mm, give me my tens
Give me, give me my tens

Then take away two, I ate, I win
Mm, give me my tens
Give me, give me my tens
Give me my tens
Then take away two, I ate it up again

===== Nicki Minaj - High School =====
148 ContributorsHigh School Lyrics
He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Alright)
Baby, it's your world, ain't it? (Uh)

She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me, "Make me a wife"
I tell her, "Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?"
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, "What about them niggas?" She say, "What about them niggas?"
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lyin'
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself
Lil Tune

They holler at me, but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Put it wherever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?
Baby, it's your world, ain't it?

I know you want it, boy
I see you tryin'
Just keep on pushin'
I'ma let you slide in
Just close your eyes and
This horizon
It's ready, come get you some
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh, mmm, kyuh
R.I.P. to B.I.G. 
Classic shit

I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
"I used to pray for times like this" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said "Go to hell"
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit, uh

I remember when I used to have a crush on Special Ed
Shoutout Desiigner 'cause he made it out of special ed
You wanna fuck me, you gotta give some special head
'Cause this pussy have these niggas on some special meds
Like Mike Tyson, he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, "Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit?"
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake
I been a five-star bitch, man, word to Gotti
I'ma do that nigga Future dirty, word to Scottie
Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', "Gang! Gang!"
This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang
Tekashi want a ménage, I said "tre-way"
Curved him and went the Kim and Kanye way
Em, cop the Barbie Dreamhouse, then you can play the part
I-I ain't tryna bust it open in a trailer park

And if he act like he know, I let him fuck it again
I got them bars, I'm indicted
I'm poppin', I'm uninvited
I said, "Just lick on the clitoris, nigga, don't fuckin' bite it"
I ride his **** in a circle
I turn Stefan into Urkel
I go arounds and arounds and I'ma go down in slow motion
The-then I pick it up, look at it
I said, "Daddy, come get at it," uh
Yellow brick road, he said that I am a wiz at it
Yeah, they want it, want it
You know I flaunt it, flaunt it

Gorillas is in my unit, vacationin' where it's humid
And I shine, shine, shine, got diamonds all in my cubans

Sagittarius, so you know I'm an optimist
Man, keep it all real, I'm a prophetess (Okay)
So at least you took an L off your bucket list (Bucket list)
It's time to make hits and it's time to diss
How you still dissin', still can't find some hits? (Okay)
Was it worth it, dummy? I ain't mind a bit
Still on that show gettin' no chips, time to dip

I, I, I, I-I, I-I, I (Okay)
I'm still fly, just bagged a white guy (Okay)
Ritchie like Guy and I still eat Thai
Want the Nicki cheat code? Come on, bitch, nice try

Let's be real, all you bitches wanna look like me
Wanna be in demand, get booked like me
Wanna run up in the lab and cook like me
But ain't nan you hoes pussy good like me
Pussy so good his ex wanna still fight me
Face so pretty bitches wish they could slice me
She just mad 'cause he never bought her ice like me
I cut all my niggas off, but they would still wife me (Still wife me)

Rap bitches tell they team, "Make 'em like Barbie"
Had to come off IG so they can't stalk me
All they do is copy looks, steal music too
Want to see what bitches do when they lose the blue-print
I mean the pinkprint, ho, let it sink in
I spoke to Jay the other day, he's still the kingpin
He's still the only nigga that I woulda signed to
If I ain't sign to Wayne's perfectly designed crew
'Cause we the big three, don't need a big speech
We made the biggest impact, check the spreadsheet
That's Lil Weezy, the Barbie and Drizzy Drake
Niggas gettin' more cheese, kissy face
I'm a bad bitch, fuck the bitch (Uh)
Bitch get slick, I'ma cut the bitch
I'm a bad bitch, suck some dick (Okay)
If that bitch get slick, I'll cut the bitch
I'll cut up the bitch, I'll gut the bitch (Okay)
Had to fuck up the bitch, man, fuck the bitch
Won't shoot her but I will gun-butt the bitch
When we say "Fuck the bitch," dick up the bitch
She was stuck-up so my niggas stuck up the bitch
Still draggin' her so don't pick up the bitch
Get the combination to the safe, drug the bitch
Know the whole operation been bugged the bitch

I, I, I, I-I, I-I, I (Okay)
I'm still fly, just bagged a white guy (Okay)

When it come to stealin' flows, these birds is fluent
But they stutter when get asked 'bout the queen's influence

===== Nicki Minaj - Bed of lies =====
102 ContributorsBed of Lies Lyrics
Oh, yeah

Do you ever think of me when you lie (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine (Ooh-ooh)
And, oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?

You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't ever pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, "This nigga buggin'"
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'
No more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

Do you ever think of me when you lie (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine (Ooh-ooh)
And, oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy

They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song
So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Just another girl)
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)

Do you ever think of me when you lie (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine (Ooh-ooh)
And, oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?

Oh, why do I live this-a-way? (Hey, must be the money)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this-a-way? (Hey, must be the money)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, tryna spot something real nice
Looking for a little shawty I noticed
So that I can take her home (I can take her home)
She can be eighteen, eighteen with an attitude
Or nineteen, kinda snotty, acting real rude
Boo, as long as you a thicky, thicky, thick girl
You know that it's on (you know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow (Ayy)
Saying she be peepin' and "I dig the last video"
"Somewhere, Nelly, can we go?" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34 (Nelly)
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you groovin' way over there

Without no vouchers on her boots, she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shoppin' with plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that four dot six Range
Watch the candy paint change every time I switch lanes

Making a living off my brain instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my mama
Put the whip in my own name now
Damn, shit done changed now
Runnin' credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (C'mon), I can't complain now (No more)
Shit, I'm the mayne now in and out my own town

Waitin' for the right time to flash them keys
Then, uh, I'm leavin', please believe in (Oh)
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check it, got it locked at the top of the Four Seasons
Penthouse, rooftop, birds I'm feedin'
No deceivin', nothin' up my sleeve and
No teasin', I need you to
Get up, up on the dance floor
Give that man what he askin' for (Oh)
'Cause I feel like bustin' loose
And I feel like touchin' you, uh, uh
And can't nobody stop the juice
So baby, tell me, what's the use? I said

Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin' the bottles? (C'mon)
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models?
I see you drivin' sports cars, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I'll be down to do a hundred, top down and goggles
Got off the freeway, exit 106, and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Went Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cause, baby, I can't talk it
Warm (Uh), sweatin' (Uh), it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tank top on at this point
You're wit' a winner so, baby, you can't lose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun
So take it off like you're home alone
You know, dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend
Like, "Girl, I think my butt gettin' big!" (Oh)

It's gettin' hot in here (So hot)
So take off all your clothes (Ayy)

73 ContributorsJust a Dream Lyrics
Uh, uh, uh (Hey)
I was thinking 'bout her (Uh), thinking 'bout me (Hey)
Thinking 'bout us (Us), what we gon' be? (Hey)
Open my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream (Hey)
So I traveled back (Uh), down that road (Hey)
Will she come back? (Back) No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream

I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby, I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My lover, my life
My shawty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right

Uh, uh, uh (Hey)
I was thinking 'bout her (Uh), thinking 'bout me (Hey)
Thinking 'bout us (Us), what we gon' be? (Hey)
Open my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream (Hey)
So I travel back (Uh), down that road (Hey)
Will she come back? (Back) No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream

When I be ridin', man, I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryna get my Usher on but I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinkin' all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm goin' through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong

Uh, uh, uh (Hey)
I was thinking 'bout her (Uh), thinking 'bout me (Hey)
Thinking 'bout us (Us), what we gon' be? (Hey)
Open my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream (Hey)
So I travel back (Uh), down that road (Hey)
Will she come back? (Back) No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream (Uh, uh, hey)

If you ever loved somebody, put your hands up (Hands up)
If you ever loved somebody, put your hands up
And now they gone and you wishing you could give them everything (Everything, hey)
Said if you ever loved somebody, put your hands up (Hands up)
If you ever loved somebody, put your hands up (Hands up)
Now they gone and you wishing you could give them everything

Uh, uh, uh (Hey)

Hot shit

Mmmm, I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
(Come on)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
(Hot shit)
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Mmmm, you can find me in St. Louis rollin' on dubs
Smokin' on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like Cocoa Puffs
Sippin' Bud', gettin' perved and gettin' dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, accumulated enough scratch just to
Navigate it, wood decorated on chrome and it's
Candy painted, fans faintin' while I'm entertainin'
Wild, ain't it? How me and money get acquainted
Plus I hang with Hannibal Lecter (Hot shit)
So feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud (What?), I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause, I'm righteous, above the law
Player my style's raw, I'm Born to Mack, like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamour, give me D's with a rubber hammer
My grammar be's Ebonics, gin, tonic and chronic
Fuck Bionic, it's ironic, slammin' niggas like Onyx
Lunatics 'til the day I die
And I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
(Come on)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
(Hot shit)
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Who say pretty boys can't be
Wild niggas, loud niggas, O.K. Corral niggas
Foul niggas, run in the club and bust in the crowd, nigga
"How nigga?"
Ask me again and it's goin' down, nigga
Now nigga, come to the circus and watch me clown, nigga
Pound niggas, what you be givin' when I'm around, nigga
Frown niggas, talkin' that shit when I leave the town, nigga
Say now, can you hoes come out to play now?
Hey, I'm ready to cut you up any day now
Play by my rules, boo, and you gon' stay high
May I answer your Third Question like A.I
Say, "Hi", to my niggas left in the slamma
From St. Louis to Memphis, from Texas back up to Indiana
Chi-Town, K.C., Motown to Alabama
L.A., New York Yankee niggas, to Hotlanta
Louisiana, all my niggas with country grammar
Smokin' blunts in Savannah, blow thirty mil', like I'm Hammer

I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
(Come on)
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now
I'm going down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Let's show these cats to make these
Millions so you niggas quit actin' silly, mon
Kid quicker than Billy, mon, talkin' really and I need it mon
Flows, I kick 'em freely mon, especially off Remi, mon
Keys to my Beemer, mon, holler at Beenie Man
See me, mon, chiefin', rollin' deeper than any mon
Through Jennings mon, through U-City back up to Kingsland
With nice niggas, sheist niggas who snatch your life, niggas
Trife niggas who produce and sell the same beat twice, nigga (Hot shit)
Ice, niggas, all over, close to never sober
From broke to havin' brokers, my price-range is Rover
Now I'm knockin' like Jehovah; let me in now, let me in now
Bill Gates, Donald Trump, let me in now
Spend now, I got money to lend my friends now
We in now, candy Benz, Kenwood and 10's now
I win now (Woo), fuckin' lesbian twins now
Seein' now, through the pen I make my ends now

I'm goin' down, down, baby, your street in a Range Rover

Street sweeper baby, cocked, ready to let it go

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what, listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Except how I'm gettin home tomorrow
Cease will drop you off when he see his P.O (Hey)
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Griffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, "You know what you do to me"
She starts off, "Well I don't usually" (*Let's go*)
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South (Ow)

Add the whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold
Yo
We 'bout to start an epidemic with this one
Y'all know what this is, So So Def (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty more at the top (Uh-huh)
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white rose, traditional gold
I'm changin' grills every day, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (Oh), in my white tee (Oh)
Or on South Beach (Oh), in my wife beat
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see, my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
'Cause when I
Open up your mouth, your grill gleamin' (Say what?)
Eyes stay low from the chiefin' (Chiefin')
I got a grill I call penny candy, you know what that mean?
It look like Now and Laters, gumdrops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave you for nothing, only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in your city, somewhere out in your hood, just say

Smile for me, daddy (Woo)

What it do, baby? It's the iceman, Paul Wall (Yeah)
I got my mouth lookin' something like a disco ball (Yeah)
I got the diamonds and the ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath (Already)
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling, showing off my diamonds, sippin' on some potent oil (Baby)
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats, thirty stacks, let 'em know I'm so for real (For real)
My motivation is them thirty pointers, VVS
The frontage in my mouthpiece simply symbolize success (That's right)
I got the wristwear and neckwear that's captivating (What?)
But it's my smile that got these onlookers spectating (Hah)
My mouthpiece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad (Come on)
My teeth are mind-blowin', givin' everybody chills
Call me George Foreman, 'cause I'm sellin' everybody grills

Smile for me, daddy (Woo)

Gipp got them yellows, got them purples, got them reds (Hey)
Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head (Hey)
You can catch me in my Too $hort drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box
It's what it do, in the Lou', ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks and the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em, you can spot 'em on the top and the bottom
Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
Ain't dissin' nobody, but let's bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white (That's right)
These ho's can't focus 'cause they eyesight blurry
Tippin' on some 4's, you can see my mouth jewelry
I got four different sets, it's a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same, got my name in the mold
Add a whole top diamond and the bottom rose gold (Come on)

Smile for me, daddy (Woo)

I think she know she makin' me hard
Got every man in the building like, "Oh my God"
She slicker than lodi-dodi, she work her body, body
When you done hurr at the party, meet me down there in the lobby
And I'll be waitin' on ya, ain't no debatin' on ya
I got a seat for ya, we can let the top back and go
We don't have to stop, girl, no
I got a lil' somethin' I wanna show
Believe me, you're strong
Lil' mama, please don't make me wait too long (Yea-yay)

The way that you're walkin', the way that you're talkin' (Talkin')
You're the one I wanna spend this night with
Tryna get in them drawers and bang it out 'til the mornin' (The mornin')
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) I can already tell you want it
'Cause you're shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Rubbin' that body on me
Keep on shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Rubbin' that body on me

Now I see you're lookin' at my body, babe
And now you wanna come and put it on me
If I gave it to you, could you promise me
That you could make it feel like it never did?
'Cause I see you (I see you) and you see me (You see me)
Now if I please you (I please you) could you please me?
(You please me)
Now I ain't the one in no relationship
And I ain't tryna be the other chick
I know you want it

The way that you're walkin', the way that you're talkin' (Talkin')
You're the one I wanna spend this night with
Tryna get in them drawers and bang it out 'til the mornin' (The mornin')
(Ah-ah-ah-ah) I can already tell you want it
'Cause you're shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Rubbin' that body on me
Keep on shakin' it all for me, givin' it all to me
Rubbin that body on me

22 ContributorsOver and Over Lyrics
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh

'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin' you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, yeah, I can't shake it no

I can't wait to see you
Wanna see if you still got that look in your eye
That one you had for me
Before, we, said our goodbyes
And it's a shame that we
Gotta spend our time bein' mad about the same things
Over and over again about the same thing
Over and over again
Ho, but I think, she's leavin'
Aw, man, she's leavin'
And, I don't know what else to do
I can't go on not lovin' you

'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin' you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
Yeah, and I can't take it, yeah, I can't shake it no

I remember the day you left
I remember the last breath you took right in front of me
When you said that you would leave
I was too damn stubborn to try to stop you or say anything
But I see clearly now
And this choice I made keeps playin' in my head
Over and over again play in my head
Over and over again
Ho, I think, she's leavin'
Aw, man, she's leavin'
And, I don't know what else to do
I can't go on not lovin' you

'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin' you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, and I can't shake it no

Now, that I've realized
That I'm goin' down
From all this pain you've put me through
Everytime I close my eyes (Woo)
I lock it down, ohh-hooo
I can't go on not lovin' you

'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
And I can't keep picturin' you with him
And it hurts so bad, yeah
'Cause it's all in my head
I think about it over and over again
I replay it over and over again
And I can't take it, no I can't shake it no

Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh

Uh, over and over again, over and over again
'Cause it's all in my head

===== 50 Cent - In Da Club =====
Go, go, go, go go, go, go shawty , it's your birthday
We goin party like it's yo birthday
We goin sip bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday!

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll 20 deep, It's 20 knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Drew, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck
But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I dont walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying, 50 you hot
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas l tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed

My flow, my show brought me the doe
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look nigga I got K-Mart and I ain't change

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad?
I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumpin in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let em hate
Watch the money pile up
Or we go upside there wit a bottle of bub
You know where we fucking be

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed

Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither, nigga
We in the club all the time, nigga, so pop, pop off, nigga

Turn my headphone down a little bit, yeah
For so many reasons
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I do), yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, ah, ah, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah

How much money you got? (Straight up)

How many times did you lie? (A lot)
How many times did she leave? (A lot)
How many times did she cry? (A lot)
How many chances she done gave you?
Fuck around with these thots (A lot)

Every day that I'm alive, I’ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 forev’, ain't no way I'ma switch

Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)

Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six hour drive, six and a half
Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don’t want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I’m batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it ’cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest who did it
Before it all ends, nigga

How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)
How many pray that you flop? (A lot)
How many lawyers you got? (A lot)
How many times you got shot? (A lot)
How many niggas you shot? (A lot)
How many times did you ride? (A lot)
How many niggas done died? (A lot)
How many times did you cheat? (A lot)
How many times did you lie? (A lot)
How many times did she leave? (A lot)
How many times did she cry? (A lot)
How many chances she done gave you?
Fuck around with these thots (A lot)

===== Doja Cat - Ain't Shit =====
Man
This happened one, two, three times too much
These dumb-ass niggas
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
You can say that again
Niggas is square like Madison
I can't even really get mad at them
They fall, then I gotta facepalm
Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassing
Ten-page text, should've wrote a book, could've made a bag
But he broke and he still waiting 'til I can chill
And he really think I'ma get back to him
Doing too much, relax a bit
Acting like that 'cause your dad's a bitch
Must be the way that the planets is
Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick
I'm a freak, not a masochist
Should've known you had the baddest bitch
Left on read and can't give head
Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Said that's not cheating if I wasn't with your ass, yo
You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so (your cousin)
Logical thinking is just something that you lack, so
What you even mad for? Looking like a stick up in your asshole
I'm not your mommy, nigga, find a new hobby, nigga
Return, yo, 'fore I get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga
I'm not gon' key your car, I'll call your fucking mom
You should have paid my rent, go get a fucking job
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did, listen to your friends
When they say, niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent

Baby, I like your style
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe, but I never run away

My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)
"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted"
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"

Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?

Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady

===== Eminem - Sing For The Moment =====
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problemed child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad, so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, durags, and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

(Come on) Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Uh-huh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great (Ugh)
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So, I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, b'
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you (Bitch)

(Come on) Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one 'cause they think this shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Haha)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can—

Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Sing with me (Sing), sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

===== Dr. Dre - Still D.R.E. =====
Yeah, nigga
I'm still fucking with you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 nigga
Guess who's back?
Still, doing that shit Andre?
(Oh for sho', check me out)
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed
They wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name
I'm ahead of my game
Still puffing my leafs
Still fuck with the beats, still not loving police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
Since the last time you heard from me, I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali' weed, I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the a.m., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I give you (Still) D-R-E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on the corner with your fly bitch (Biatch)
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back
So if you ain't up on thangs
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E
Right back up in your motherfuckin' ass
Nine-five plus four pennies, add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some wit' your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky-icky-icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!
Well, you's a fool, D-R, ha-ha

===== Dr. Dre - Nuthin' But A "G" Thang =====
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
(Cause you know we're about to rip shit up)
Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothing but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'mma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earning her man
And learning her man (and at the same time burning her man)
Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom
Well I'm peeping and I'm creeping and I'm creep-in
But I damn near got caught, cause my beeper kept beeping
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those
So just chill till the next episode
You've got the feeling
To rock the other side
You've got the feeling
(Yeah, yeah)
Falling back on that ass, with a hellafied gangsta lean
Getting funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N double-O P
D O double G Y, D O double G, ya see
Showing much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimping hoes and clocking a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some mothafuckin' G shit
(Hell yeah) so Dre (What's up Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off something (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumping, (City of Compton)
Is where it takes place so, when asked, your attention
Mobbing like a motherfucker but I ain't lynching
Dropping the funky shit that's making the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie: they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, cause if I slip then I'm slipping
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight tripping
And I'mma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Putting the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better
Like this, that and this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill till the next episode
You've got the feeling
To rock the other side
You've got the feeling
(Yeah, yeah)
You've got the feeling
To rock the other side
You've got the feeling
(Yeah, yeah)
You've got the feeling
To rock the other side
You've got the feeling
(Yeah, yeah)

===== JAY-Z - 99 Problems =====
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a b- ain't one
I've got the Rap Patrol on the - patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say, "He's Money, Cash -"
I'm from the hood, stupid, what type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your Zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, "- critics, you can kiss my whole -
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast-forward"
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a sh-, so
Rap mags try and use my black -
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to riches, -, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a b- ain't one, hit me!
99 problems, but a b- ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a b- ain't one, hit me!
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the mother- law
Got two choices, y'all, pull over the car or (mm)
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?"
"'Cause I'm young, and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest, or should I guess some more?"
"Well, you was doing 55 in a 54 (uh-uh)
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are"
"I ain't steppin' out of sh-, all my paper's legit"
"Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"
"Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that"
"Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?"
"I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my sh-"
"We'll see how smart you are when the K9 come"
I got 99 problems, but a b- ain't one, hit me!
99 problems, but a b- ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a b- ain't one, hit me (ah, ah)
99 problems, but a b- ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a b- ain't one, hit me!
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A n- like myself had to strong-arm a h-
This is not a h- in the sense of havin' a p-
But a p- havin' no god- sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gon' be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' 'em
D.A. try to give a n- shaft again
Half a mil' for bail 'cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my g-
I got 99 problems, bein' a b- ain't one, hit me!
99 problems, but a b- ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a b- ain't one, hit me!
99 problems, but a b- ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a b- ain't one, hit me! (Whoo! Whoo!)
Havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, and a b- ain't one
You crazy for this one, Rick
It's your boy

===== JAY-Z - Renegade =====
Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling-bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked, "No, he's not around"
Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Haha)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
'Cause here we go, he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a

Never been afraid to holler about anything

I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me
I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan, my pops left me
And often my mama wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' "Dixie"
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?), I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a motherfuckin'

While y'all pump Willie, I run up and stunt silly (uh-huh)
Scared, so you sent your little mans to come kill me (uh)

Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathin' soft on him
"What's ya name?"
Who shot ya? Mob ties like Sinatra (uh)
Peruvians tried to do me in, I ain't paid them yet
Tryin' to push 700s, they ain't made them yet

Keep your hands high, shit gets steeper (uh)
Here comes the Grim Reaper, Frank White
Leave the keys to your InnKeeper (that's right)
Chill, homie, the bitch in the Shoney's told me
You're holdin' more drugs than a pharmacy

===== Ice Cube - It Was a Good Day =====
Yeah (you are)
Yeah (you are)
(You are)
Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', "Will I live another 24?"
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can do it all night
Called up the homies, and I'm askin' y'all
"Which park are y'all playin' basketball?"
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, messed around and got a triple-double
Freakin' brothers every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a brother's direction as I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of homies and watch me break 'em with the seven
7-11, 7-11, seven, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin', "Domino"
Plus, nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.
Today was a good day
Left my homie's house paid (word)
Picked up a girl been tryna dig since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
Felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my jimmy runs deep, so deep
So deep put her butt to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her butt off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for the murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read "Ice Cube's a Pimp"
Drunk as hell but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say it was a good day
Hold up, Pooh, stop this, man
I don't know what I'm thinkin' about

===== Kendrick Lamar - HUMBLE. =====
Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (yeah, yeah)
Ay, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse on 'em with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives in fact, I'm downin' this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' waist the world with my paystub
I know that it's good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Eat up your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know
Tell 'em, be humble (hol' up), sit down (hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil')
Be humble (hol' up), sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil')
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up), sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil')
Be humble (hol' up), sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up), sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil')
Be humble (hol' up), sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil')
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up), sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil')
Be humble (hol' up), sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Who that, uh, thinkin' that he frontin' on Man-Man? (Man-Man)
Get the, uh, off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the, uh, off my (ay), that ain't right (hol' up)
I make a play blowin' up your whole life
I'm so-so sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural, I wanna feel some stretch marks
Still I take you down right on your mama couch in Polo sock
Ay, this is way too crazy, ay, you do not amaze me, ay
I blew cool from AC, ay, Obama just paged me, ay
I don't fabricate it, ay, most of y'all be fakin', ay
I stay modest 'bout it, ay, she elaborate it, ay
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ay
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ay
If I kill a, um, it won't be the alcohol, ay
I'm the realest, um, after all
Tell 'em, be humble (hol' up), sit down (hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil')
Be humble (hol' up), sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil')
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up), tell 'em sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil')
Be humble (hol' up), sit down (hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Be humble (hol' up, hol' up), sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil', hol' up, lil')
Be humble (hol' up), sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil')

===== Kendrick Lamar - m.A.A.d city =====
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
"Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!"
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where - hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the .9
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's, "Ayy y'all, duck"
That's what momma said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies
IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
"Yawk! Yawk! Yawk"
Wake your punk ass up
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang, G-yeah
Real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin' nigga), hood (sup cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang, G-yeah, how we do
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin' in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking, the next weekend, we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick, a.k.a. Compton's Human Sacrifice
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the 80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt nakeds, dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit, block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the hood, loc, G-yeah, that's cool (G-yeah)
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But G-yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep' colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately (G-yeah)
Couple of IVs with the fucking spray-can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip (G-yeah)
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap 'cause G-yeah, it's so real (G-yeah)
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grands where a motherfucker stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen
Would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons
Would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive
Hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?
M.A.A.d city
Compton
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holding it for?
Niggas always acting unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up! Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip, just lay back and drink that

I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi 'til I'm charged
Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin' time like
Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timb's on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether crusing in a Sikh's cab, or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches
Aiming guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-getting style, rolling foul
The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child
Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days, for broke days we sell it, smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesus, soaking their sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
How you living? Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You're flipping coke or playing spit, spades and strip poker?
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
Yo, the world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(It's yours)
Break it down
(It's yours)
(It's yours)
(It's yours)
(It's yours)
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, a thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
'Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbing women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin', Big Willie-style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burning dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks with a bop, checking dames, plus the games
People play, bust the problems of the world today
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this? (Yeah)
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(It's yours)
Break it down
Yeah, aight
To everybody in Queens, the foundation (it's yours)
The world is yours
To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours (it's yours)
The world is yours
To everybody in Brooklyn
Y'all know the world is yours (it's yours)
The world is yours
Everybody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours (it's yours)
Long Island, yo, the world is yours (it's yours)
Staten Island, yeah, the world is yours (it's yours)
South Bronx, the world is yours (it's yours)
Aight

===== Nas - It Ain't Hard to Tell =====
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin a sniper's death
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shinin', sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin
Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin
Cause in my physical, I can express throuh song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Nas, stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el
Inhale from the L, school a fool well, you feel it like braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick the skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm Ill
plus Matic, I freak beats slam it like Iron Shiek
Jam like a tech with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin while you're plannin ways to sabatoge me
I leave em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell

This rhythmatic explosion, is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggaz is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep well let me try again
Wisdom be leakin out my grapefruit troop
I dominate break loops, givin mics men-e-straul cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groovy but smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stallone in Cobra
Packin like a rasta in the weed spot
Vocals'll squeeze glocks, MC's eavesdropT
Though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas's raps should be locked in a cell
It ain't hard to tell

===== Nas - Life's a Bitch =====
Ayo, what's up? What's up? Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? (Yeah, yeah)
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'? 'Cause we spendin' these Jacksons (yeah, yeah)
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
'Cause, yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, 'cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
I woke up early on my born day, I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated 'cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, 'cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this, I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', "Fuck tomorrow!"
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die

I apologize a trillion times
My baby's drama mama, don't like me
She be doing things like having them boys come from her neighborhood
To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real

I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real

Me and yo' daughter, got's this thing going on
(We got a special kind of thing going on)
You say it's puppy love
We say it's full grown
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin' fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
Uh, uh, yeah
"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass home girls
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about? Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Took a shower kinda sour cause my favorite group ain't comin' wit' it
But I'm wit' ya you 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway
But anyhow when in doubt, went on out and bought it
'Cause I thought it would be jammin', but examine all the flawsky-wasky
Awfully sad and its costly but that's all she wrote
And I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up - creek "It's weak" is the last quote
That I wanna hear when i'm goin' down when all's said and done
And we got a new Joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down

===== Public Enemy - Bring the Noise =====
Bass! How low can you go?
Death row, what a brother knows
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal
The uncannable D, Public Enemy Number One
Five-O said, "Freeze!" and I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I never really had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell cause my records, they sell
Cause a brother like me said, "Well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you wanna do is follow for now"
Power of the people, say
"Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical"
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again
Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Never badder than bad cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
Cause the beats and the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside
Music that the critics are blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters
Mow, cause the country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait
Till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this
Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My deejay is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Making a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, but we ride limos, too
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run-DMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on its feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B. and LL as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it
Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Turn it up! Bring the noise!
From coast to coast, so you can stop being like a comatose
"Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast toast"
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last. Why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
We got to plead the Fifth, we can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight
Hey, posse's in effect, got the Flavor, Terminator
X to sign checks, play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue
A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you
Yeah, I'm telling you

===== Salt-N-Pepa - Shake Your Thang (It's Your Thing) =====
We was on a dance floor shakin' our thing
To a funky beat with a go-go swing
Everyone was watching, they stared in shock
Amazed at how Salt and Pepa was rockin the place
With a smile on my face
Some got upset and then tried to base
They called us nasty, said we danced dirty
Claimed we were freaks, cheap, even flirty
Pepa got pissed and pulled out a pump
I was all set not to jet but to jump
Spin broke it up and asked not to break
Said, "They don't understand the way you"
Shake your thang, owww
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you how to catch a groove
It's your thang (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I won't tell you who to sock it to
Shake that thing, c'mon, y'all, shake it
We could get loose, but we can't get naked
It's not a crime, it's legal, we answered
Look again - see? We're just dancin'
Relax a bit, now ain't that better?
I think it's time for you to get a
Partner, doe-see, gather in closely
I wanna see the ones that mostly
Front on a cutie, hope you're not fruity
Do your duty and
Shake your thang, owww
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you how to catch a groove
It's your thang (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I won't tell you who to sock it to
Come on, y'all, shake that thing
You got to just show no shame
I want you to shake that thing
Come on, y'all, show no shame
Shake your thang, yeah yeah
Oh, you're lookin' sweet, baby
Owww, I won't tell you how to catch a groove
It's my thing, and I'll swing it the way that I feel
With a little seduction and some sex appeal
It's Friday night, and I just got paid
I'm checking out the fella with the high-top fade
Moving in closely, ready for the kill
Steppin' on a dance floor, think you're ill
But if I guy touch my body I just put him in check
I said, "We just met", "We can't do that yet"
I'm not a pick-up (no), this ain't a stick up (boy)
I'm not stuck up (yeah), and turn to kick up
And just rock, baby-pop, don't stop
Stick out your butt, and shake what you got
Shake your thang, owww
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you how to catch a groove
It's your thang (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I won't tell you who to sock it to
Oooo, I like hip-hop mixin' with go-go, baby
It's my thing, and I shake it crazy
Don't try and tell me how to party
It's my dance, yup, and it's my body
The shirt I wear may be low cut
My jeans fit nice, it shows off my butt
Designer down from head to toe
Oooo, my hair, neck, and fingers is crazy-glow
Now please stop blushin', we're just dancing, dummy
C'mon, we both know I don't want you for your money
Cuz we like to rap so we always rhyme
I like to dance, oooo, and I like to grind
I like this song, I like this beat
I'll see you later, where shall we
Shake your thang, owww
Do what you wanna do
I can't tell you how to catch a groove
It's your thang (It's your thing)
Do what you wanna do
I won't tell you who to sock it to

ha-ha-ha, I'm serious, nigga
One of y'all niggas got some bad motherfuckin' breath
(Uh, ayy, shit) ayy baby, ayy baby
Ayy baby, get some bubblegum in this muhfucker or somethin'
Ayy, nigga, get somethin' to eat, dog
Study long, study wrong, nigga
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kinda hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky ass shit like every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's (yeah)
And make a few ends as I breeze through (yeah)
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin' 'cause my mama ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' 'til six in the mornin' (six in the mornin')
So what you wanna do? Shit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what?) We don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this
Gs up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this types of shit happens all the time
You gotta get yours, but fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listenin' to the D-O-G
I got the cultivatin' music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (oh, that bitch?)
Eighty degrees when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, 'cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
Beyotch, I'm just
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)
Later on that day
My homie Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin' up off the cot
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door
And I'll be
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back (with my mind on my money and my money on my mind)
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice

===== Soulja Boy - B.O.R. (Birth of Rap) =====
Just for now, just for now, just for now
Just for now, just for now, just for now
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while
Lil B, Based God
King of rap, I can bet my money on that
Can't face the facts that a young guy killin' shit
Give me another shot and I'mma come with my mask on
Seen a lot of growth since I came with the Vans song
Now it's '09 and I'm runnin' with the Based God
Fire in my eyes, mix my soul with the napalm
Mix and master, all I need is dro and one mic
One pad, one pen, iPod, dim lights
Feelin' like a plane when it's up and it's in flight
Dressing everyday like I'm dead with the pinstripe
This a few things that show that I'm the rawest
Spend the cash everyday so I'm ballin like Spalding
Want beef, like six I'll have you baldin' like Baldwin
Your favorite rapper out, I'mma lay 'em in a coffin
No talkin' when I'm talkin', cause it's legend, pay attention
Only time I sat in class was when I'm serving a detention
I fuck with Soulja Boy, get money nigga
Everytime I see rappers, all I'm thinking, "I'ma get him"
In the booth or in the streets, I been known to tear and rip 'em
Fifteen and sixteen, eyes breaking down the system
Nobody can tell me nothing, I was living off my system
Head fucked up, I thought it would be cool to go to prison
Watching Hot Boyz on BET getting all these women
So I got my gold grill because I'm thugged out with 'em
B-Town, Waterfront, and I put on for my city
We done did it for six years, just reached twenty
A lot of dudes I grew up with didn't see twenty
Everytime I have a birthday, I'm thinking, "God love me"
Everytime I hit the beat, man, I do it for my Mom
Workin' hard every day, I'mma make it where it's mine
I'mma hustle all the time, like Lil Wayne do
If you up against me, you get ate like grapefruit
My first reaction was like, just chill and stay cool
The rap game is slow, and it just ain't cool
Always jocking on my style and it just ain't you
Only time I feel you is if a based boy do
Because I'm a rap god and a based boy, too
I can listen to the hate and put the volume on mute
So the only thing I hear is the horses in the coupe
And when the roof go down, it reminds me of my chick
Getting money off the floor because I'm trapping like a bitch—
Like Gucci Mane said, but it's rich nigga clique
And my name is Lil B, you can call me "king of rap"
I done did a few things and I'm never goin back
Mirror mirror on the wall, shit, I'm askin who the man is
Lil B for "Lil Boss, " I'm prayin to my canvas
I deserve the crown because I'm speakin for the masses
And I'm into weed, I'm gettin chiefy like Kansas
Word to the wise, you should fear the competition
Because I'm the only vet that's a Based God spittin
And you ain't in the game until you make a thousand songs
And you dyin' for this rap, 'cause it's the only thing you love
Birth of Rap
Birth of Rap

Plans to leave, throw the keys to lil' cease

A T bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few 'cause in a few, we gon' do

Damn, why she wanna stick me for my paper?

Hello? Aw shit, nigga
What the fuck time is it, man?
Oh goddamn, nigga
Do you know what time it is?
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on? You aight?
Nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you?
When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies
God'll prob'ly have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice (you talkin' some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (get a hold of yourself, nigga)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder, if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? (Nah, nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit (nigga, what the fuck?)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red (it's too late for this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't, I can't believe (yo, I'm on my way over there, man)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand (nigga, talk to me please, man)
You see it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (yo, I'ma call you when I get in the car)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street?
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone (yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak (ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (ayo, c'mon, nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'
(Ayo, Big, ayo, Big)
Please hang up, and try your call again
Please hang up, this is a recording

The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong

Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke — gunsmoke, gunsmoke!
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer, the hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers!
"Hail Mary, full of grace..." — smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag and her North Face off her back
Jab her if she act
Funny with the money? Oh, you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, capiche-ah? I'm out like "The Vapors"
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho? The head honcho
Swift fists like Camacho, I got so
Much style, I should be down with the Stylistics
"Make Up To Break Up," niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor and me hittin' the clits! (Yeah)
Suckin' on the tits (Uh), had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was "Humpin' Around" and "Jumpin' Around"
Jacked her, then I asked her "Who's the man?" She said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-E

(Yo, Big, you're dead wrong)

When I get dusted, I like to spread the blunt like mustard
Trust it! My hardcore rain leaves ya rusted
Move over, Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, uh!
Leave you toothless, you'll kibitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G's
Disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies — no ifs, ands, or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis after she sucked the dick
I stabbed her brother with the ice pick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Found your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feeling it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab you 'til you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin' (Woo!)
Because you know I love it young, fresh, and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?

The weak or the strong, who got it going on?
You're dead wrong (Yo, Big, you're dead wrong)

You're dead wrong (Ladies and gentlemen...)

There's several different levels to Devil worshippin'
Horses' heads, human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals – havin' sex with 'em, camels, mammals, and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit
I just beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin' meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket — I'm lyin', I got a .9 in my pocket
And, baby, I'm just dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My Uzi's heavy as yours, yeah, you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I'll lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wed on the third, then she's dead on the fourth!
I'm dead wrong!

The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong (Yo, Big, you're dead wrong)
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?

1970 somethin'
Nigga I don't sweat the date, my moms is late
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins
In this world, the fly girl (Yeah)
Tanqueray or Hennessy until I called Earl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck (Hey yeah)
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
While, Juvenile rippin' mics and shit (Ooh)
New York, New York ready for the likes of this
Uh, then came the worst date, May, 21st
2:19 is when my mama water burst
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical chord's wrapped around my neck (Ooh)
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy (Ooooh ooh ooh)
The doctor looked and said "He's gonna be a Bad Boy."

I remember back in time
(1970 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(19, 70 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Let me take you back in time
Before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin' somewhere yeah

Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God, to reverse it, I'll give my Left Eye
With the right I'll visualize the king of Bed-Stuy (Ooh)
Checkin' his daughter, Tyanna into junior high (Yeah)
If I was in Brooklyn and B.I. was still alive
In 2006, it might sound like this
NY, 7-1-8's, 2-1-2's
With Sue's rendezvous, it's like Moulin Rouge (Ohh ohh)
High fashion, uptown Air Force Ones and Vasquez
Puerto Ricans with fat asses (Ooh ooh)
Blazed dutch masters, we dump ashes
On models in S classes for you bastards (Ohh ohh)
Catch a cab to Manhattan, with that Broadway actin'
You hype, that Belly shit'll get you capped and wrapped in plastic
Tell the captain to ask Rog' What's Happenin'?
I hear, nor speak no evil inside the magnum (Ooooh ooh ooh)

Before all the dollars and nines
I knew that I was goin' somewhere
(19, 70 somethin', 1970 somethin')
Let me take you back in time

Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team (Yeah-ah)
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream (Ooh oh)
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school, I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up (Ohh)
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself (No-oo)
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself (Oooh)
Put the drugs on the shelf, nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, king of New York, I wanna be it (Oh yeah)
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
C-74, Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind a great steel gate (Oh no)
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail

I remember back in time
(1970 somethin')
Before all the homies died
Before all the dollars and nines

And I knew that I was going somewhere yeah

===== 2Pac - Ambitionz Az A Ridah =====
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public (Hahaha)
My attitude was "fuck it," 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
(And, uh) And my ambitions as a ridah (Excuse me, baby)
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her (Got ya)
Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, ho!"
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke (Hahaha)
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay us
I got no time for these bitches (Hell no), 'cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me blitzed on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so (Haha)
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row (Yeah)
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and trick us (Haha)
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart are strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous, 'cause deep in they hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah (Haha), and now you got me right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, I catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me (My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)

It was my only wish to rise above these jealous
Coward motherfuckers I despise, when it's time to ride
I was the first to hop inside (Let's go, nigga, let's go), give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life (Yeah, nigga!)
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So I open fire until you kill me, witness my steel (That's all you niggas got? Hahaha)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama (Dear Mama), come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then, nigga, die for it
Let them other bustas try, at least you tried for it (Hahaha)
When it's time to die, then be a man and pick the way you leave (Yeah, nigga)
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me (My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Stay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years (I'm back, baby)
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck) Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish
My powers, so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace (Them niggas cowards)
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas (Bitch-ass niggas) on my team so indeed they wet me up (Punk niggas)
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it (Hahaha)
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it (Yeah, right)
Witness the realest, a who-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cries from all your people when they find her, must remind ya
(Thug life) My history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggas that played me and all the cowards that was down wit' it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, got you payin' attention to my ambitions
As a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me

But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talkin' 'bout you gettin' money but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy why you fuckin' with me?
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin' outta prison, pistols in the air
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm 'bout to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I hit 'em up
I'm from N-E-W Jers'
Where plenty murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario
Little Ceas', I'll bring you fake G's to your knees
Coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper clique smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my clique lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
And all your fake ass East Coast props
Brainstormed and locked
You's a beat biter
A Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alizé with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
Thug Life, niggas better be known
We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'
No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off
Nigga, I hit 'em up

===== 2Pac - Hail Mary =====
Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body
The blow is like a 12-Gauge shotty
Uh, feel me
(Come with me; Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see)
And God said he should send his one begotten son
(What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?)
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! (La, la-da-la-la-la-la-la)
Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!

Come with me
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, la-da-la-la-la-la-la

I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me through my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

Come with me
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da
Come with me
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da

Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
Much too hardened for a smile, way too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Bail 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary, nigga

Come with me
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da
Come with me
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da

They got a A-P-B out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai Chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that motherfucker, nasty new street Slugger, my heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond
When I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up

If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

Come with me
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Come with me
Hail Mary, Hail Mary (Hail Mary)
We won't worry, everything will curry
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, hail Mary
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, la-da-la-la-la-la-la-la-da

Westside, Outlawz

===== 2Pac - Runnin’ (Dying to Live) =====
Between you and Biggie it was like, who's gon’—who’s gon’— who rules the nigga kingdom and shit, basically, you know what I'm saying? I was like, this is like a fucking
It is like that
Election. It’s an election and shit
It is that
You know what I am saying?
Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that. Me and Biggie’s situation is like…

You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know?)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't faze me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die? (t's on me)

But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed "Thug Life" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

They wanted a new regime
And my regime includes East Coast, includes West Coast
I was more shocked than anything
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him—
Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong
So when they was like "he got shot"
I was just more like, "Again?" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always gettin' shot, or shot at
He goin' to pull through this one, again
Make a few records about it, and it's goin' to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But when he— when he died, I was just like
"Woah," you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by
I mean, even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody
You know what I'm sayin'?
Because there ain't no comin' back from that

===== Tyler, The Creator - GONE, GONE / THANK YOU =====
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer
To my December
Was it my August?
Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone (two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone (oh), gone, gone
Kept me going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (keep)
Kept me going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (keep)
You keep me going (gone, gone, gone)
The Band-Aid is falling off now (going)
And now I'm scarred for life
My love is gone (gone), my love is gone (gone)
My love is gone (it's gone), my love is gone
Ayo, there's poison in that gumbo (my love is gone)
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock (my love is gone)
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't raining (love is gone)
My stupid ass brought an umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's ninety degrees and all the tricks up my sleeve (love is gone)
Is drenched in sweat and illusion because I jet to conclusion
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that (love is)
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
She opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started building a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my building got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
Need me to do it over?
(Where? Everything)
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul
Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
I said go, go
Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy
But I don't ever want to fall in love again (again)
Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever want to fall in love again
Again, again
Again, again, again, again, again, again
(Got my eye)

What that nigga want, God?
Word up, look out for the cops though (Wu-Tang five finger shit, fam)
Cash rules-
Word up, two for fives over here, baby
Word up, two for fives, niggas got garbage down the way
Word up, know what I'm sayin'?
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. get-
Yeah, check this old fly shit out, word up
(Cash rules everything around me) Take you on a natural joint
(C.R.E.A.M. get the money)
(Dollar, dollar bill, y'all) Here we, here we go, check this shit, yo

I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had second hands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin' woolies at 16
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question, I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question, I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from 'cross seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's
Yo, nigga, respect mine, or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-pow! Move from the gate now

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar, dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar, dollar bill, y'all

It's been twenty-two long, hard years, I'm still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much
Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not—
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turned, I learned life is hell
Livin' in the world no different from a cell
Every day I 'scape from Jakes givin' chase
Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask: What's it worth?
Ready to give up, so I seek the old Earth
Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks and stray shots
All on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer
And ain't tryna hear what I'm kickin' in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar, dollar bill, y'all
Cash rules everything around me (My niggas gots to do what they gotta do)
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar, dollar bill, y'all (To get through, know what I'm sayin'?)
Cash rules everything around me (Because you can't just get by no more)
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar, dollar bill, y'all (Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down)
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M., get the money
Dollar, dollar bill, y'all

Yeah, yeah
Cash rules everything around me

56 ContributorsAir Force Ones Lyrics
Big boy

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' about 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I damn near shot 'em

Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; may niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

Me? I like the limited edition in khaki and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

Don't get me wrong, man
Now Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin' there as if I'm shootin' free throws
I said, "Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes"
She said, "I love you Murph, especially in the white 'n blue"
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice"
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), "Thanks for the advice"

I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers, the Broncos, the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops, which the clear sole
But it's Timb's and fat laces when it's cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit' them lil' dots in the toe
Ain't nothin' stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho'
On dem Nike Air Force, "NE" behind the "O"

O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces and put wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin' in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin' dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, they know I'm buyin' dem

Now don't nothing get the hype on first sight like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin' them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em, I gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose, ya heard me, kinda like my Daytons

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

I wore spurs at first now there's tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (you wildin') fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

Now sometimes I get em free and some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and the platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

Now in the box is where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine (peep mine)
Rock em once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love Pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl

(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

Can you hear me out there?
Lunatics.. is y'all ready?
Let me hear ya
Uh-ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

I'm a sucker for corn rows and manicured toes (hey)
Fendi capri pants and Parasuco's (alright)
The rise of Diddy and City, with one or two throws
I'm draftin' 'em outta high school straight into the pros
Who knows? I know and I love it when you make your knees
Touch your elbows and break it down low to the Flo'
And there you go now throw it on me slow
And everytime I bust a rhyme, baby, "Gimme Some Mo'"
You say you like that, when I hit it from behind and I'll be
Right back, yeah that's my very next line, I use it
Time after time, when I'm speakin' my mind
It's no matter if I'm shootin' game to a pigeon or dime
I ask her, "Who that is, talkin' that shit about the 'tics?"
Somebody probably jealous 'cause they bitch got hit
But ain't nobody else droppin' shit like this
Should we apologize? Nah fuck 'em, just leave 'em pissed, hey

Nasty, don't be scared boo, go 'head and ask me

See the joint blaz-on, somethin' smells amaz-on
I got a chick rollin' up, half black and Asi-an
Another one page-in, tellin' me to come home
Her husband on vacation and left her home alone
I used the V-12, powers; weight loss, powers
From Phat Farm to Iceberg Slim in one shower
Get a room in Trump Towers just to hit for 3 hours
Kicked the bitch up out the room 'cause she used the word ours, hey

Wash my hands under a gold spout, when feelin' icky. Let
Go off in a ho's mouth, I ain't picky
Start frontin' when the shows out, whatchu mean?!
Twenty inches when they roll ouuuuuuut, come and get me
Big faces when they fold ouuuuuuut, is you wit me?

I keep it closer when the dough ouuuuuuut, then I
Slide up in the Escalade, me and E gettin' solid like the Ice Capades And me and Heezy, Frosty, Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy

22 ContributorsMy Place Lyrics
I used to pride myself on being the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand that anything I'm offering
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguing
From the time I picked you up, until the time I dropped you off again
Even if flipped out on me at the mall again
"It's all his fault again," that's what you're telling all your friends
I ain't pointing fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how your day going I know they stressing on you
I know them times get hard that's why I'm checking on you
It's yours truly ma, I got a little message for you
Anything he can do, girl I can do better for you, 'cause

When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me)
Oh girl, come on over to my place (my place, my place)
Won't you sit yourself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl, we gon' do it our way (our way)

I heard your friend tell a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinking that we should do it one more time
If this ain't the truth then hopefully it's not a lie
'Cause I ain't got no issue with hitting that another time
We never had a problem with getting it done
Disagreed upon a lot ma, but the sex wasn't one
Now check it I know you get excited (still) when I come around and bite it
(Girl) quit frowning up and quit acting like you don't like it
(I like it) I know you like, (I like it)
You really like it, (I really, really like it)
(I want it), I know you want it, (adore it)
Adore it, (so come let me enjoy it)

When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me)
Oh girl, come on over to my place (my place, my place)
Won't you sit yourself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl, we gon' do it our way (our way)

Shorty, where you been?
Feels like a long time
Long, long time since I seen you
Yes it has, girl
And I know I said some fucked-up things to you before
But girl you know I didn't mean it
(I'm sorry)
I never meant one single word
If I could take back every word I would and more for sure
If I thought that you would believe it
(Would you believe it?)
Hey, girl, 'cause you make my life so convenient for me

When we laugh or we cry, it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon' still be as one, it's forever
It's forever, it's forever

Won't you come on and go with me (let's go, let's go)
Oh girl, come on over to my place (get back home to my place)
Won't you sit yourself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl, we gon' do it our way (shorty)

===== Nelly - Batter Up =====
33 ContributorsBatter Up Lyrics
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
This is Mark, oh-who-gives-a-fuck from '93 TV
This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
(Hey hey guys) Yeah, yeah, yeah
We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game
And now.. please rise for the singing of our national anthem!

Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (That's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god livin; like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sittin' strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand, baby, where the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today?
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fuckin' with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed
Now you stays on yo knees cause we's be in the big league
'Cause we's be in the big league

Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (That's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

Well you should see me now, I'm eatin' Wheaties now
I'm stealin' second and third, lookin' home, gettin' greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for runnin' the quickest miles
Hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (Yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thang
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (That's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

Well uhh this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school (Yeah, I heard that)
(It's a great day though)
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows
Mur-uhh, Murphey Lee or somethin)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'm a sixteen-year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you somethin' now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rappin'
Money, money, money, money what's happenin'
I'm comin' up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with, you know how we do
We do, we do, we do, we do, we do

Mmm, I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (That's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we livin', it's Lunatics playa
It ain't nothin' wrong with that, huh, batter up

Pull up outside, shawty hop up in the ride

Got some buds on ice and the bud rolled tight
Just got off the nine to five

Pull up outside, shawty hop up in thе ride

Got a twelve gauge shotty, in my stance, sittin' on my land
That's just how a country boy do
Got a styrofoam cup in my hand, that's just who I am
And that's just how a country boy do

My pimp cup stood up mad bitches
My Levi got that rare stitchin', yeah

Uh, uh, uh
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh uh uh uh uh
Uh, uh, uh uh uh uh huh uh uh (Woo!)
Uh uh, uh

Ayo ma, how you doin'? It's your son now
And I picked up the mic and put the drugs down
Now I'm tryin' to do some things that'll make you proud
Instead of every time I call it's to bail me out
Oh why didn't I listen to things you used to tell me?
Knowin' that everything that you said would never fail me
Like they got plans for ya, ain't nothin' I can do
When them laws get they hands on you, but I ain't listenin'
Even payin' attention, I'm just tryna get mine
Takin' advantage, you workin' two jobs at the same time
Ungrateful, complainin' about Nike and Polo signs
But you always come through, and what do I do
I wreck both your cars, stole money from your drawers
Sold dope out your yard, stayed into with them laws
Tryin' to pay you back for all the stress that I caused
And always be there to give you whatever you want

(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said you don't have to work no more
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, 'cause ya son will be there for you
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh

Now verse two, yeah that's for you boo
I send you props 'cause you the only one that stuck through
When I'm upset and stressed you give me back rubs
When I'm depressed you give me head off in the bathtub (E-I!)
On your P's and Q's, on your Q's and P's
You hear my beeper goin' off and you just throw me my keys
Ain't even askin' me yo is it coochie or G's
And for that reason girl you can ask me for anything
Not a for real smoker but you choke with me
Not too hot about the drinkin' but you toast with me
Livin' at your granny house you kept the dope for me
And wouldn't hesitate to go to court for me
Need money? My boo'll go and work the avenue
My boo'll fuck you up if I ask her to
That's why I do the things I do
And I will always be there to give you whatever you want

(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said I don't wanna lose you, no
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, 'cause you're my boo and my only one
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh

I'm doin' this one here for Shaun Haynes, Lashando and J.D
D Quick, Boo Gees and Fatty
My nigga Lil' Erv, Gino and Poochie
And everybody over on Euclid and Labade
Young Big Touch, Pooh and Big Baby
Rio, J.T. and Big Money
Herky Jerk, Wezz and Pea and Cody
J.E., K-Ug and Odie
Toe-Fa, M.J., and Colby
And all my soldiers down at Fair Ground on Monday
My Lunatic fam, Kyjuan, Murphy Lee
City Spud, T-Love and Big 'Li
Yellow Mack, Slow Down, Courtney B
The rest of my niggas up in the N.Y.C
And without Trail, Cooter and Coach it just wouldn't be
And I will always be there to give you whatever you want

(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, I said whatever you need
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, 'cause y'all my niggas for life you know
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, you can always smoke with me
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
Uh, uh, uh, uh

(If you feel it, pop it and lock it)
Just like that, you know
Anybody else I forgot, in the city
(If you feel it, pop it and lock it)
North side (If you feel me, pop it and lock it)
South side, all the shorties, you know who you are
All the BC's, you know who you are
(Don't stop ever lovin' me)
I ain't got to give shouts out to everybody, y'all know

===== Nelly - Heart Of A Champion =====
29 ContributorsHeart of a Champion Lyrics{*Nelly exercising and breathing hard*}

I guess he's back 'urr derrty, STL derby
I'm like Magic to Kareem, mayne you tell me I ain't Worthy
I ain't speakin 'bout a jersey, I'm speakin 'bout income
DID YOU HEAR THAT ELIZABETH? HERE COME THE BIG ONE!
I put mo' money in the community than you got in yo' budget
I wipe my ass with yo' advance to the toilet then flush it
My last stance be a stance of a General Custer
I hot dog cause I can, I got the cheese and mustard
I got the stats of a hall of famer - in just two records
That's why I'm back up at the Super Bowl with Julius Peppers
I got that can't stop, won't stop, in my veins
That's why they can't stop, won't stop, screamin the name
NELLY! NELLY! Go tell a friend to tell a friend
I'mma keep the same grin whether I, lose or win
Up, or down ten, I'mma fight to the end
{*breathing hard*} Let's go

Ain't no way they can stop me now Nelly
Cause I'm on my way, I can feel my ring comin'
It's the blood of a champion, pumpin'
Deep inside my veins, too much pride to be runnin'
I'mma get what I can and more, even if
My blood, my sweat, and my tears don't mean nothin'
It's the heart of a champion (it's the heart of me)
(It's the heart of a..) in me

I'm the first pick, the first round, signing bonus profound
Playin for his hometown, reppin' for the home ground
And gettin' bucks like Michael Redd, tell 'em again
I gets bucks like Michael Redd, heard what I said?
The MVP of the game, intensity still the same
I'm shootin' out from my reign, with Peyton Manning-type aim
Can't stop me from scorin' so they resort to just hackin'
So there's, three of us now - me, A.I. and Shaq'n
From the look to the as I say
Hover man with more heart than Hallmark on Valentine's Day
I'm the one that you've been ravin' about, like Ray Lewis
I think it hard to go and change your route
Cause you don't know if I'm blitzin' or if I'm sittin' and readin'
Waitin for you to go and trip, drop back and throw up a pick, man
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW

Ain't no way they can stop me now Nelly
Cause I'm on my way, I can feel my ring comin'
It's the blood of a champion, pumpin'
Deep inside my veins, too much pride to be runnin'
I'mma get what I can and more, even if
My blood, my sweat, and my tears don't mean nothin'
It's the heart of a champion (it's the heart of me)
(It's the heart of a..) in me

It's like a big time decision made on how I can twurk it
If hard work pays off then easy work is worthless
My work habit ain't no habit man, I do it on purpose
I push myself to the limit so my talent'll surface
So now it's, curtains and drapes, on anybody who hates
Dislikin what I'm recitin, bitin what I've been writin
I've been dogfightin, scratchin and clawin on every hike
Tryin to make you remember me like you Remember the Titans
Cause I'm a WARR-IOR, my daddy was a soldier
A Vietnam vet, lil' derrty I thought I told ya
I'm supposed ta, whip up your town in Testarossas
Heatin like Folgers mayne, I'm young, black, and rich
As good as it gets, and givin your point guard fits
He think he done seen pressure mayne, but he ain't seen shhhh...
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW
AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW, AIN'T NO WAY THEY CAN - BLOW
 - repeat 2X

===== Nelly - #1 =====
27 Contributors#1 Lyrics
Uh uh uh
I just gotta bring it to they attention, dirty, that's all...

You better watch who you talkin' bout
Runnin' your mouth – like you know me
You gon' fuck around and show why the "Show Me" get called the "Show Me"
Why one-on-one you can't hold me, if your last name was Hanes
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on your pants
No resident of France; but you swear I'm from Paris
Hundred-six karats – total? Naw, that's per wrist
Trying to compurr this – my chain to yo' chain
I'm like Sprint or Motorola – no service, out of your range
You out of your brains, thinkin' I'ma shout out your name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to catch your fame
All that pressure you applyin', it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blindside, takin' your sleeves off
As much as we's floss, still hard to please, boss
Don't be lyin', bitchin', and cryin' – suck it up as a loss
'Cause your, acts is wack, your whole label is wack
And matter fact, eh eh-eh, eh a-hold that

I... am...  #1 – no matter if you like it
Here, take it, sit down, and write it
I... am... number one
Hey hey hey hey hey hey – now let me ask you, man
What does it take to be #1?
2 is not a winner and 3 nobody remembers (Hey)
What does it take to be #1?
Hey hey hey hey...

Do you like it when I shake it for ya, daddy? Move it all around? (Whoo!)
Let you get a peep before it touches the ground?
Hell yeah, ma – I love a girl that's willin' to learn
Willin' to get in the driver's seat and willin' to turn
And not concerned about that "he say," "she say," "did he say
What I think he said?" Squash that, he probably got that off eBay
Or some, internet access, some... website chat line
Mad 'cause I got mine, don't wind up on the flat line
Ohh, if my uncle could see me now
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulatin' my style, right to the "down down"
Can't leave out the store now, better wait 'til they calm down
I got hella shorties, comin' askin', "Yo, where the party?"
Ohh lordy – will I continue to act naughty?
Mixing Cris' and Bacardi, got me thinkin' fo' sho'
I'm not a man of many words, but there's one thing I know – Pimp

I... am...  #1 – no matter if you like it
Here, take it, sit down, and write it
Hey – I... am... number one
Hey hey hey hey hey hey – tell me now, dirty
What does it take to be #1?
2 is not a winner and 3 nobody remembers (Tell me)
What does it take to be #1?
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

Check it, uhh, check, yo
Aiyyo, I'm tired of people judgin' what's "real Hip-Hop"
Half the time you be them niggas who fuckin' album flop
YOU KNOW! Boat done sank and it ain't left the dock
C'MON! Mad 'cause I'm hot; HE JUST – mad 'cause he not
You ain't gotta gimme my props, just gimme the yachts
Gimme my rocks, and keep my fans comin' in flocks
'Til you top the Super Bowl, keep your mouth on lock
Shhhhh... {*crickets*} I'm awake, ha ha ha!
I'm cocky on the mic, but I'm humble in real life
Taking nothin' for granted, blessin' e'rrything, on my life
Trying to see a new light at the top of the roof
Baby, name not Sigel but I speak "The Truth"
I heat the booth – Nelly actin' so uncouth
Top down, shirt off in the coupe, spreadin' the loot
With my family and friends, and my closest of kin
And I'll do it again, if it means I'ma win

Hey –
Dirty, I... am...  #1 – no matter if you like it
Here, take it, sit down, and write it
I... I... I am... number one
2 is not a winner and 3 nobody remembers
Number 1
'Cause 2 is not a winner and 3 nobody remembers

One, two, three, uh!

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

Hey ya! Hey ya!

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But "got it" just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all (Ah!)
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is, "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance

Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)

All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)

Now, don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now, I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (Okay), shake it, sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

Now, all the Beyoncés and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor (Get on the floor)
You know what to do, oh, you know what to do
You know what to do

But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time
And the other half either got you
Cussed out or comin' up short
Yeah, now dig this, now even though (even though)
You'd need a golden calculator to divide (to divide)

Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said, "Shorty, would you call me?"
She said, "Pardon me, are you balling?"
I said "Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing"
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't wanna get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you
(Not support you, not support you)

I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank, but

Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

Sir Lucious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlos
And El Dorados
So I'm waking up out of my slumber, feeling like Rollo
So follow – it's Showtime at the Apollo, minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print? Ah
Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson sipping a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm, in the dorm room at the AU
We blew hay too, athletes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make 'cause–
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

Canary yellow seven-nine Seville is on display
My nigga Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the Honeycomb Hideout
I'ma show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be Bambino on your snipper
YKK on your zipper, lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzered
Or sober, six million ways to fold ya
Like Noah's, I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'
But I'll call yo' ass 'round eight-ish, I know you'll be there for me, girl
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

Those huge baby eyes
Get to runnin' off at they mouth and tellin' me everything that's on your nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned, in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, love who you ain't — you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for 'bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips, 'til hips jerk, in double-time
The boy next door's a freak, ha-ha!

Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

And we are... The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
And my, my... The sky is fallin', ain't no need to panic
But ooh, ooh... I got a stick and want yo' automatic
Ooh, ooh, ooh... Compatible, created in the attic
And we are... The coolest motherfunkers on the planet

Not clashing, not at all
But, see, my nigga went to do a little acting
Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one, pass 'em
Drip-drip-drop—there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks (Thanks!)
So "click it or ticket," let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat 'rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S, bass?

I love the way you move
I love the way you move, woo-ooh-ooh
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well, I was looking at them, there, there, on the dance floor
Now, they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
'Specially the big girl
Big girls need love, too—no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
And let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out "Timber!" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male-friend boyfriend was boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail – on the low, ho
I like the way you move
I like the way you move, woo-ooh-ooh
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way you move, woo-ooh-ooh
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way

Hey, baby, girl, don't you stop me
Come on, lady, dance all around me
You (Look so fine) You look so fine (Look so fine)
You driving me (Out of my) out of my mind
(Out my mind) Ooh, baby, if I could
I would just leave with you, baby
Oooh, 'cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me, baby, ooh!
I like the way you move (I like the way you move)
I like the way you move (Ooh, you're so sexy, baby), woo-ooh-ooh
I love the way you move
I love the way (Oh, oh), I love the way (Ooh)
I love the way you move (I love the way you move)
I love the way you move (Ooh, you're so sexy, baby), woo-ooh-ooh
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way
I like the way you move
I like the way you move, woo-ooh-ooh
I love the way you move
I love the way, I love the way...

===== Outkast - ATLiens =====
147 ContributorsATLiens Lyrics
Yeah, uh, East Point, smokes some dank
College Park in the house
Decatur
Uh, Old National got the skanks
Everybody, uh, know what I'm sayin'
Check it

Check it
Well it's the M-I-crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
"Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit"
Bend corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I
Is that same motherfucker that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving a shoutout to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

Now, my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender, ain't nothing better
Let me know when it's wet enough to enter
If not I'll wait, because the future of the world depends on
If or if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of its skin tone?
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?
They alienate us 'cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain't no lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?
Now everybody say

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at The Dungeon shooting pool
Like E-S to the P-N, cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone)
Honey, I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife be making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me

Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody gots to play their part
God works in mysterious ways, so when He starts
The job of speaking through us, we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away, I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition, so I'm ready for war, okay

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

One, two
One, two, three, yeah!

Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (Woo!)
Like a million elephants or silverback orangutans
You can't stop the train
Who want some? Don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Better be a household name
Weatherman tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
The 1-9-9-9 Anno Domini, anything goes
Be what you wanna be as long as you know
Consequences are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell—hot!
Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm & Hammer
Soul-gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let yo' brain breathe
Believe there's always mo', ow!

Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah! (Yeah, ha, ha, yeah)
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah! (Yeah, oh-ah)
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah! (Ha, ha, ha, yeah)
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah!

Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there, boy, and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend dyin' to geek
OutKast bumpin' up and down the street
Slant back Cadillac, 'bout five niggas deep
75 MC's freestylin' to the beat
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club
Shoulda bought an ounce, but you copped a dub
Shoulda held back, but you throwed a punch
'Posed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl, four-year—Jordan
Never turned my back on my kids, for them
Should've hit it, quit it, rag-top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, "Control"
Like Janet, Planet, Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida
Lock all your windows, then block the corridors
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece fish 'fore I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pitty-pat rappers tryna get to five
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL, boy, you better not hide
'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, ha-ha!

Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah! (Ah, yeah)
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah! (Ah, yeah)
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah! (Y'all over, yeah)
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something

Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James

Dickie shorts, Lincoln's clean
Leanin', checking out the scene
Gangsta boys, Bigga's lit
Ridin' out, talkin' shit
Nigga, where you wanna go?
You know the club don't close 'til four
Let's party 'til we can't no more
Watch out, here come the folk—"Damn"
Oh, Lord


As the plot thickens, it gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles
A lil' discotheque, nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia
A lil' spot where young men and young women
Go to experience they first little taste of the night life
Me? Well, I've never been there
Well, perhaps, once, but I was...
So engulfed in the Ol' E', I never made it to the door
You speak of "hardcore"
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine, bow-legged girl –
Fine as all outdoors, lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with "Set It Off" in the right
But it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it
"Hey, hey—look, baby, they playin' our song!"
And the crowd goes wild, as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But, in actuality, it's only about 3 a.m.,
And three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance – sliced up
Two niggas done started busting—"Wham! Wham!"
And one nigga done took his shirt off, talking 'bout:
"Now, who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?"
It's just my interpretation–of the situation

Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Damn, damn, damn, James
Yes! When I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a brown stallion horse with skates on, you know?
Smooth, like a hot comb on nappy-ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece, just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes, you dig?
One moment, you frequent the booty clubs
And the next four years, you and somebody's daughter raisin' y'all own young'n
Now, that's a beautiful thang – that's if–
You're on top of your game, and man enough to handle real-life situations, that is
Can't gamble feeding a baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient
But the United Parcel Service and the people at the post office didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now, you back in the trap
Just that – trapped!
Go'n' and marinate on that for a minute

Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja

122 ContributorsElevators (Me & You) Lyrics
One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hookup
Now, every day, we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh)
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling off instrumentals
Had my pencil, and plus, my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole-in-the-wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like, "Freeze!" We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's, and that's a no-no

Yeah, uh
Check it, a-one-two, a-one
"Two dope niggas in the Cadillac," they call us
Went from "Player's Ball" to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say, "Motherfuck that playin'," they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
"OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise"
Over a million sold to this day; niggas, they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all player-haters can bite me
I'm out this bitch

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Uh
Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rallys, bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them white girls before them blunts got crunk
Chunky asses, passes getting throwed like Hail Marys
And they looking like Halle Berrys
So, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother, James, things changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, "Momma, I want to sing
But, momma, I want to trick (Trick), and momma, I'm sucking dicks, now"
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82
Me and you like Tony! Toni! Tone! (Yeah)
Yeah
Like this, East Point and we gone

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from ("Ayy")
Some nigga was saying something
Talking 'bout smoke something
"Hey, man, you remember me from school?" "No, not really"
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, "What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made"
And I replied that I'd been going through the same things that he has
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet, then, I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your momma and your cousin, too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

Man, let me hit that, man
You gon' pass that?
Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs
Nothin' but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talkin' 'bout a Black man Heaven here
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah

It's beginnin' to look a lot like, what? Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept, I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least, no, no, it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find somethin' to do better, bet
I sets up trap, so shut up that
Nonsense about some silent— silent—
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like, no matter what the season, forever chill with Smith, I sip my fifth
I chill with Wesson, got my reasons, so tell me, what did you expect?
You thought I'd break my neck
To help y'all deck the— the—
Oh naw, I got other means of celebratin'
I'm gettin' blizzard at HoJo, I gots that hoochie waitin'
I made it through another year, can't ask for nothin' much more
It's OutKast for the books, I thought you knew, so now you know, let's go

All the players came from far and wide
Wearin' afros and braids, kickin' them gangster rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player ball is happenin' all day, every day

Hallelujah, hallelujah
You know, I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doin' what the players do
The package store was closed, okay, my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm gettin' serious, I'm gettin' curious
'Cause the house is smellin' stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes 'cause I'm mobbin' folk niggas in the back
Gettin' tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They havin' a smoke out in my back seat (Yeah)
They passin' herb, rewindin' verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hittin' switches
'Cause I'm switchin' from side to side, lookin' for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me, the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce, see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, ha, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is (Check it)

All the players came from far and wide
Wearin' afros and braids, kickin' them gangster rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player ball is happenin' all day, every day

Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto, so I won't be hangin' my socks on no chimney
I'm full as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smokin' rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know, in '93, that's how we comin'
So ho-ho-hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy, so, um

It goes, give me ten and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, sees a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, four, a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one, yeah

All the players came from far and wide
Wearin' afros and braids, kickin' them gangster rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player ball is happenin' all day, every day

Here's a lil' something for the players out there, hustlin'
Gettin' down for theirs
From East Point (Yeah), College Park (Check it out)
Decatur (College Park), the 'Briar (Southwest Atlanta)
You know, niggas worldwide (The 'Briar)
Down for theirs (Yeah)

All the players came from far and wide
Wearin' afros and braids, kickin' them gangster rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player ball is happenin' all day, every day
All the players came from far and wide

105 ContributorsDa Art of Storytellin’  Lyrics
Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie and the Dungeon Crew?
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew 'cause she screwed a lot
Makin' a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya, playa
I'm dickin' the ho down — never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty — that was shawty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Bimmer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped me, seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her, though — maybe she had to work?
I caught her in the mall, wearin' a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck — I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, "Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck"
I said, "Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter, plus my baby mama beeped me, too"
She said she understood and everythin' was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Wil CD and a fuckin' poster
It's like that, now

It's like that, now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about fo' or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now (Yeah)
It's like that now, it's like that now

Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha... Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber
Party, but you can not call it that 'cause it was slummer
Well, it was more like spend the night
Three in the mornin', yawnin', dancin' under street lights
We chillin' like a villain, and a nigga feelin' right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite all of the bullshit
We on our back, starin' at the stars above (Aww, man)
Talkin' bout what we gonna be when we grow up (Mm)
I said, "What you wanna be?" She said, "Alive"
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown
I came back home to find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treatin' her wrong (Man)
I kept on singin' my song and hopin' at a show
That I would one day see her standin' in the front row
But two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due
Sasha Thumper

It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about fo' or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now
It's like that now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about fo' or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now
It's like that now, it's like that now

Grandmama: Keisha, Keisha! Cut that loud mess off, you hear all that thunderin' and lightnin', and get off that telephone!
Keisha: Ugh, alright
Child 1: Grandmama, what’s all that noise?
Child 2: I’m scared
Grandmama: Baby, don’t be scared. It's gonna be alright. It’s just the Lord doin' His work, okay?

Yeah, yeah

Oh, yes, I love her like Egyptian
Want a description? My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can't be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes, and yes, I seen thangs – like Kilroy "Chill, boy – because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that," man, fuck them niggas, I'm going off
And coming right back, like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems, thinking it's better for 'em
When they can't let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call their body
Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes, even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
I'm willing to go the extra kilo–meter
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed, where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it's real, Jazzy Belle

See, what if you was a playa? Real playa not no flaw?
Having the very best of life: lobster, steak, and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed
And every single day was personal FreakNik
Tricking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception
Looking into your eyes, I see your weapon and it's depressing
They're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits
Keeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan 'cause you thinking that you my lady
Bitch, don't play me, 'cause you're janky
I wanted to hit that ass, but me and the Goodie, we got danky
So thank thee, for running that Southernplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame, a nigga don't even know yo' name
It's a shame, you cracking 'em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up (Damn)
I'm leaving these foes to be
The flowers and wake don't get me
See, I gotta be feeding my daughter (Right)
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
'Cause you'll be Waiting to Exhale, while you other hoes be Dumb And Dumber
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'? Yeah

One, two, yes –
Okay, check this out right here, now
See me and ol' girl in the black-on-black 'Lac Northstar
Windows are tinted, so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga, guaranteed to snap like bra
Straps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of Kibbles 'n Bits – I want to hurl
'Cause most of the girls that we was liking in high school, now they dyking
(Ha-ha-ha-ha)

Having no mercy for the disrespectful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be asking me all about mine
"How she do?" and "how she be?", I know she's sipping that wine
Behind my back, they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures, baby
Hey, he–faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to Hell and lay with Lucifer
'Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use her and abuse her
"Tricks hollin' they got rank"
"Tricks hollin' they got rank"
"Tricks hollin' they got rank"
"Tricks hollin' they got rank"
"Tricks hollin' they got rank"
"Tricks hollin' they got rank"
"Tricks hollin' they got rank"
"Tricks hollin' they got rank"

199 ContributorsAquemini Lyrics
Yuh
Uh-huh
Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
Nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
(Y'all know)
It's him and I: Aquemini

Yeah

Now is the time to get on—like Spike Lee said, 'Get On The Bus'
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirping—it's a must
Is you on that dust or corn starch? Familiar with that smack, man?
The music is like that green stuff, provided to you by sack-man
Pac-Man, how in the fuck you think we gon' do that, man?
Riding 'round Old National on eighteens without no gat, man
I'm strapped, man
And ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
Me and my nigga, we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times, swung hard when it was fitting
But now, we tapping the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood-grain steering wheel, for real (Real)
You can go on and chill out ,and still build
Let your paper stack, 'stead of going into overkill
And pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch

Yeah
Yuh, yuh (Yeah)
Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
And nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini
Twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
Lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from "Home of the brave," with dirty dollars
Beauty parlors, baby ballers, bowling-ball Impalas
Street scholars, majoring in culinary arts—
You know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough, from scratch
But, see, the catch is you can get caught
Know what you selling, what you bought – so, cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge—meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies, walking slowly to the candy lady
It's looking bad—
Need some hope, like the words "maybe," "if," or "probably"
More than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
I'm sorry, y'all, I often drift—I'm talking gift
So when it comes, you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course, you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it, but it's needed, so what have you?
Now, question: Is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall?
Naw
So don't get caught up in appearance
It's OutKast, 'Aquemini' – another Black experience

Okay

Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
Nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini
The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax, the nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets, 'cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that – some say we pro-Black, but we professional
We missed a lot of church, so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nutsacks – you bust 'round, we bust back
G—Get back, for real niggas that's out here tryna spit facts
You 'ear that? You can't come near that, maybe you need to quit (Quit)
Because 'Aquemini' is Aquarius and the Gemini running shit
Like this – yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin, André Ben', welcome to the lion's den
Original skin, many men comprehend
I extend myself, so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it—that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, 'cause I swear, I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
"André, this is André, y'all are just gon' have to make amends"

Even the sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, "Y"
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
And nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini
Master: Finally, Igor! We've done it, we've done it!
Igor: Yes, master! Yes, master!
Master: Igor, we've done it!
Both: Uh-oh

Greetings, earthlings

From the bottom of my lungs a nigga be blowing
Spitting his game
Coming up on ya from the South, the A-T-Liens ain't changed
Cooler than most players claim to be
A nigga that's from the A-Town see
The home of the Bankhead Bounce
Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Everytime I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi
The nigga the B-I-G like Tony Rich nobody knows why
But me and my folks, cause y'all niggas jokes like the Joker
I'm sick of these wack ass rappers like I'm tired of hoes in chokers

Who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from? South Coast slums
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac

This ol' sucka MC stepped up to me
Challenged André to a battle and I stood there patiently
As he spit and stumbled over cliches, so called freestyling
Whole purpose just to make me feel low, I guess you wilding
I say, "Look, boy, I ain't for that fuck shit—so fuck this"
"Let me explain 'only child' style so you don't dis'"
I grew up to myself not round no park bench
Just a nigga busting flows off in apartments

Now who them boys that be having it crunk every occasion
This side niggas dusting, that side niggas lacing
But in the middle we stay calm, we just drop bombs
Asking where we come from? South  Coast slums
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac
It's just two dope boys in a cadillac

It goes Broughams to the Fleetwoods, Coupes to De Villes
Hitting Girbauds and off these flows we having the playa chill
In this atmosphere this ain't no practice here
We cutting the fool now
I'm doing you at the house and throwing you out because I'm through now
Don't you love the way we claiming Bankhead, stankhead
Looking around the SWATS for the herb that's never tainted
Fainted when you heard the burban serving on the block
And all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop

Yeah, tight like nuts and bolts, sluts and hoes they get evicted
I'm dealing wit Queens in my castle—ain't worth it to risk it
Now tricks be looking at me like I'm they way up out the projects
Can't put you on my payroll, and no I ain't got no Rolex
Or no diamond; at the exit with a sign saying "We'll rap for food"
My face is bawled up cause I ain't in a happy mood
While my partner got the squeegee and the Windex
'Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax error
Bring the terror to your dome like PE
Prone to finish this out because this be a freestyle

Now who them boys that be having the crunk every occasion?
This side niggas dustin', that side niggas lacin'
But in the middle we stay calm
We just drop–

Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times
My baby a drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times

Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on (We got a special kinda thing)
You say it's puppy love, we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry (Uh, uh, yeah)
I apologized a trillion times
"Look at the way he treats me", shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out (Out)
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more 'cause my dick all in her mouth (Mouth)
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating in the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on? You keep on singin' the same song
Let bygones be bygones and you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real (Your mama a bitch)
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry

Well, it's the M-I-crooked letter, comin' around the South
Rollin' straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please, ain't nothin' but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bendin' corners in my 'Lac, boy, 'cause that's how we be rollin' here
Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kickin' the khakis and Adidas, packin' your heaters 'cause you supposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rollin' steady in that Caddy, but them fifty bottles got to go
See, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginnin'
Now I'm just a player, sippin' sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothin' to see

My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get too sprayed
Who raise your block? The one and only OutKast
Many a niggas fallin' fast and
I continue blastin'
Swiftly, they ain't gon' get me, got somethin' for 'em
The devil up in your grill and you still don't even know him
Show him who's the okay
Like collard greens and hoecakes, I got soul
That's somethin' that you ain't got
That's why your style is rotten, stop in the land of ATL
Where nothin' but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell, swollen, got my pockets, business boomin' like rockets
Folks try to stop it, but they know that it's that

It's that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now, players if you choose it, you better make sure you don't abuse it
We're gonna get you high (Southernplayalistic)
High (Southernplayalistic)

Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes, then I yell, "Ho"
And knock 'em up off they feet like a Southern hustler 'posed to do
I's in the house like— House like— a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Takin' 'em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
My crew be thick as two fat hoes sittin' off in a Brougham
I'm packin' my tag backwards if you wanna be actin' wrong
Word is bond like super glue
It's funky like pooper-scoop
And every word I say, you can true

Well, okey dokey, 'Kast out, I swear to God I got the highest boomin' Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that, you rat?
I take my time cruisin' 'round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
The one, two to the gauge, P-U-M-P
You wanna do a jack, I heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?
See, I ain't friendly, gettin' in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit, but don't try gafflin' me
'Cause sleep and you'll get served with some Southern hospitality

It's that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now, players if you choose it, you better make sure you don't abuse it
We're gonna get you high (Southernplayalistic)
High (Southernplayalistic)

Well, Southernplayalisticadillacmusik has been laid
I may wait for all day and a day, be rollin' like that today, ho
So back up off it, get up on it if you want it, y'all
Lookin' for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yup
So now I step, rather, walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are in East Point with that College Park hemp
Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

Step up in my shoes, you crews sittin' on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rollin' through
Atlanta skies be blue, the sun is beaming, it's seemin'
That I'm glistenin', rather gleaming, 20/20 got me leaning
To the side, full of pride, now, ain't that somethin'?
I'm dipping into your hood, this ain't Braille, but I'm bumpin'
Thumpin' out the roaches, Dungeon, if y'all missed it
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, P.A., OutKast, Southernplayalistic

Yeah, I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song, and I want y'all to sing along
Sing along...
See, this is the way that we walk on a sunny day
When it's rainin' inside and you're all alone
All alone... yeah!
'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)

Take a little trip, hater, pack up your mind
Look forward, not behind, then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin' 'cause he thought he could rhyme
Now if his momma is a quarter, daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts, I don't use abbrevi-
-ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother, but yep, your head I'll sever from the neck
See, ain't nothing changed, hit the stage
Set a date, sucker, in battle, we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall
Crack his back, y'all – naw
It ain't went nowhere, like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin' at the airport, who got laid off
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole-whole world-world...

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound

And the whole world loves it when you sing the blues

Player, I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish – look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat running like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stones, gather no moss
Mommy, I'm coming, I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat, like Aaliyah, then talk
"Back, back, forth, forth"
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac OutKast, just won't stop

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)

Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet, Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach, 'cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless, like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice – let's dismiss this
If you want to, you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music, we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing, God-willing, all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself, Dré
Set it on the right, and I'll set it on the left, 'cause –

'Cause the whole world loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da!)
And the whole world loves it when you make that sound

And the whole world loves it when you're in the news

Ugh
As I sit in my b-boy stance
With flip-flops and socks, and sweatpants
I'm finna enhance your brains, check it out

Once upon a time not long ago
When the playa from the Point didn't have no flow
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes, walking to the store
Caught a player slipping
But now I lay it to the floor just like carpet
'Cause I got the heat in my baby momma name now
Never bragging just to stay knot
Even when I was a younger lad, I learned my lesson
Never talk to strangers in the trap and answer questions
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons 'cause we don't sell dope
That you distribute
We don't contribute to your clandestine activity
My soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow
But so is cod liver oil
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl
Two things I hate—liars and thieves; they make my blood boil
Boa constricted, on my soul that they coil

Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel

It took your momma nine months to make it
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it
Cut that kronk clean up, I did, but I did so not safely
Don't want no AIDS, *clapping* no claps, or no rabies
Yeah, we take no shit, like, ummm, stopped up commodes
Gotta collect call, they done locked up my folks
Low blow, hit me in the left ventricle
We won't be able to ride out till two thousand four
But not for long 'cause we got a better sack to serve
Tryna take you other people 'fore your rims at the curb
'Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead, go 'head, go 'head
More head for me, while you ride to the beat
Uhh, drop, like tears, like For Fears, you know
Shout, shout, let it all out, just for my peers
And peoples who feel it's time to unwind
Like December 31st, on nineteen-ninety-nine

Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel

Okay, like this, yes, yes
One time for my boys doing King shit
Two times, too legit and it don't quit
Three times for my folks in the drop top
Four times, OutKast and it don't stop
One time for my girls doing Queen thangs
Dead fresh to the T, eating chicken wings
Three times for my girls in the beauty shop
Four times, OutKast and it don't stop


Touched by the wheelz of steel
Now, show me how you feel
Touched by the wheelz of steel...

===== Outkast - Git Up, Git Out =====
94 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishGit Up, Git Out Lyrics
Nigga, you need to get up, get out, and get something, don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to get up, get out, and get something, don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need get up, get out, and get something, how will you make it if you never even try?
You need to get up, get out, and get something 'cause you and I got to do for you and I
I don't recall ever graduatin' at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day I just lay around then I can't be found
Always askin', "Give me some," livin' life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit (What?), I've done some dumb shit
And I'm probably gon' do some more
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know, but I'm gon' say this to you, I
Get high, but I don't get too high (Why?)
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to get up, get out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of havin' to do it all?
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know somethin' I don't, do you have any suggestions?
'Cause every job I get is cruel and demeanin'
Sick of takin' trash out and toilet bowl cleanin'
But I'm also sick and tired of strugglin'
I never, ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smugglin'
Nah, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue travelin' his route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

You need to get up, get out, and get something, don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to get up, get out, and get something, don't spend all your time tryna get high (Nigga)
You need to get up, get out, and get something, how will you make it if you never even try?
You need to get up, get out, and get something (Get something) 'cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead?
See, when I was a youngster, used to wear them fuckin' Pro Keds
My mama made me do it but the Devil, he made me smarter
Taught me to jack them weak-ass niggas for they fuckin' Starters (Yeah, ha-ha-ha)
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore a tank top to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call 'em my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense, I was Rosemary's baby
And then I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see, I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em (What's up, ho?)
Wait, see, all the players came and all the players went
A player ain't a gangster, but a player can handle his shit, bitch
You need to get up, get out, get something
Smoke out 'cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah, I said it, a nigga sportin' plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade 'cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized 'cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace 'cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool
Yeah, it's real cool gettin' paid fat pockets and all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha

You need to get up, get out, and get something, don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to get up, get out, and get something, don't spend all your time tryna get high (Nigga)
You need to get up, get out, and get something, how will you make it if you never even try?
You need to get up, get out, and get something (Get something) 'cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm gettin' paranoid and steady lookin' for the time
It's eight in the mornin' and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door to get off in my ride
I'm diggin' through the ashtray, hopin' to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best
And when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to get up, get out, and get something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick in my slick
'84 Sedan DeVille, steady bouncin'
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killer that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
'Cause they known for jumpin' out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here comes the Red Dogs, I'm bustin' out around the corner in my hog
Dippin' from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead
'Cause I have no time for jail
Fuck Clampett cops, fuck Eldrin Bell
And crooked-ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinkin' that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo'
OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie-hoo
My White Owls are burnin' kind of slow

You need to get up, get out, and get something, don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to get up, get out, and get something, don't spend all your time tryna get high (Nigga)
You need to get up, get out, and get something, how will you make it if you never even try?
You need to get up, get out, and get something (Get something) 'cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

Y'all tellin' me that I need to get out and vote, huh, why?
Ain't nobody black runnin' but crac-kers, so, why
I got to register? I thinkin' of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep-ass rhymes
So let me take y'all way
Back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ayy
Y'all could not tell me nothin', thought I hit that bottom rock
At age thirteen, start workin' at that loadin' dock
They layin' my mama off of work, General Motors trippin'
But I come home banked like Hank from lickin' and dippin'
Doin' dumb shit, not knowin' what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips over to East Point, still actin' a fool
Wastin' my time in the school, I'd rather be shootin' pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about mackin' hoes and wearin' pimp fades
Instead of bein' in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not thinkin' about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up, I should've listened when my mama told me
That if you play now, you're gonna suffer later
Figured she was talkin' yang-yang, so I payed her
No attention and kept missin' the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feelin' broke as shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-U-T-Kast
So get up off your ass

You need to get up, get out, and get something, don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to get up, get out, and get something (Get something), don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need to get up, get out, and get something, how will you make it if you never even try?
You need to get up, get out, and get something (Get something) 'cause you and I got to do for you and I

You need to g—
You need to g—
You need to g—
You need to g—

===== Outkast - Crumblin' Erb =====
54 ContributorsCrumblin’ Erb Lyrics
Yes, sir, let me dig into your brain, folks falling like rain
Poverty got me selling things, guess I'm gon' explain
Jane is rolled up, no gangs be throwed up
But still, André got action, they sweat like Keith, all on my teeth
I take it upon myself to handle mine
Thinking that you gots ample time to do this
Have you shot? I thought you knew this
I'm crumbling, no time for fumbling
Selling my sacks, watching my back
Wetting 'em up like splish, leaving 'em in a splash
Of blood, the clock is ticking, niggas from my block is missing
I'm putting it down like it be hot before we all get shot
Got only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claiming pro, but I be saying they procrastinating
Settling for less
Better be ready when they roll up in your nest and sink one in your chest
And you's gone, up out of here for good
Y'all be bobbin' back and forth to let me know you understood
Yeah, what's up?

There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' herb, I'm just crumblin' herb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (That's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' herb, I'm just crumblin' herb

So check me out, see
Once in a while, when niggas be trying to test me, I gets frisky
Grab a pint of golden whiskey
Then they swing but, shit, they missed me, huh
I'm getting nice with them things because I do like that
You heard me on the radio and, yes, my man, I'm true to that
I run my lyrics the way y'all wanna hear 'em
And shoot my dice against the bricks the way I wanna flicks 'em
Nigga, so ring around the roses, diamonds around my neck from flexing
But I'm running niggas over like a ninety-four Lexus, test it
Ten millimeters, count 'em, nigga, fuck a nine
See, I added a millimeter for y'all niggas doing crimes
And drive-bys, kiss your ass bye-bye, sayonara, suckers
I flipped the script and turned the page, ain't scared of you motherfuckers
Be popping shots like them hoes be popping coochies
And I still be spreading bullets like them freaks be spreading cooties
So look here niggas, I'm hunting Red October
I said my shit and ran my lyrics and now my verse is over

There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' herb, I'm just crumblin' herb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (That's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' herb, I'm just crumblin' herb

Woo, Big Boi
Got a Tampa Nugget blunt box, it's empty
That's where the herb be dropping, it's simply marvelous, time is ticking
But some of that time when I be laying vocals in the Dungeon
Sugar Bear and Mone be smoking ounces like it ain't nothing
It ain't shit to take another hit, so hit it
Of the cannabis sativa, weed, reefer, yeah, smoke shit
It's all day, every day 'til they label me deceased
So fire up another one and smoke out and fuck the world, peace

We is gonna smoke out until we choke out
Like some merry men, cowards, I be buryin'
Coming around my shop with that, see, nigga, you gets nothing
Just like DJ do the cutting, I be having your posse ducking
Nothing but king shit, I am asking, sucker, can you hang?
That player with the pepper throwing salt off in your game
Sprinkle, sprinkle, motherfucker, don't be crying on me
That southern cess be in my chest until I'm chillin' in peace, yeah

There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' herb, I'm just crumblin' herb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (That's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' herb, I'm just crumblin' herb

Ah, shit now
Coming in like two fat hoes sitting off on Corn Flakes
Dropping these things like French fries in hot grease
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, P.A., OutKast
The J-O-I, just to let y'all niggas know
Forever pimping, never slipping, that's how it is
That's how it's gon' be, that's how it was in the past
That's how it's gon' be in the futures, nigga
It's all day, every day, so what you wanna do with it?
Bring that shit on, know what I'm saying? Yeah

There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' herb, I'm just crumblin' herb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (That's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' herb, I'm just crumblin' herb
There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' herb, I'm just crumblin' herb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (That's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' herb, I'm just crumblin' herb
There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' herb, I'm just crumblin' herb

===== Outkast - Babylon =====
80 ContributorsBabylon Lyrics
I came into this world high as a bird
From secondhand cocaine powder—I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted, but it's in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges without no snap-back
And, bitches, they say they need that to shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route, turn each other out, burn each other out
Where a bona fide nigga like me can't even get no backrub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part?
But let me hold it down, 'cause they shut you down when you speak from your heart—now that's hard
While we rantin' and ravin' 'bout gats
Nigga, they made them gats, they got some shit that'll blow out our backs
From where they stay at
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here, someday we will be gone
So I'm hopin' (Hopin'), wishin' (Wishin'), prayin'
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith)
In you, in you

Yo, yo, yo
I'm fascinated by the way your nipples peek at me through your blouse
Freaky me, freaky you, can't help but be aroused
'Scuse me, Lord, lustful thinkin', but that was the way we was brought up
Sneakin' to watch 'Playboy' at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot, like when we went to the woods and laid with the squirrels
During P.E., we'd be–explorin' each others privates
Hunchin' with all our clothes on until we felt excited, then... (Ah)
Oh, now it's on from here on out
Put yo' hands in the atmosphere, if you know what I'm talkin' about
Now if too harsh then walk on out and I'll see you on the next song
They call it horny because it's devilish, now, see, we dead wrong

Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun (Oh)
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin' (Prayin')
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith in you)
In you (Oh, ooh)

People don't know the stress I'm dealin' with, day to day (Day)
Speakin' about the feelings I'm possessin' for Rene
Mopin' around and wonderin' where she stay, saw her last that she lay
"Give it another day," I say, but the Lord, he taketh away
Now give it back, Lord, 'cause that's like backboards without the rims
Me and my auntie was tight like Southwest
Before the pinks moved in
Like the niggas who owned the liquor stores
Crack cocaine, pimps, and whores
Livin' up on this Earth before a nigga like Daddy was born
But they be makin' it seem that my music and crime are team
But I'm speakin' the truth not dreams (Dream)
So what in the fuck they mean? My lyrics stay clean

Ooh (Yeah), I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here, someday we will be gone (So I keep hopin')
So I'm hopin', (And) wishin', (And) prayin' (Prayin')
To keep my faith in you (My faith in you)
In you

Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun (Just begun, oh-woah)
Ooh, though we're here, someday we will be gone (Oh, yeah)
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin' (Ooh)
To keep my faith in you (My faith in you)
In you
Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, though we're here, someday, we will be gone (I keep hopin')
So I'm hopin', wishin', prayin'
To keep my faith in you

My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you (Keep my faith)
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith...

Everybody rock with me because I'm up now
Took your girl and I'ma score like I made the touchdown
Swervin' in that Lambo', doors go up, not on a bus now
Used to want a G-Shock, now I'm walking with a bustdown
Pull up and I'm flooded with a iced out watch
Whip, it look like butter, baby, pecan drop
Pecan drop, put that four in Sun Drop
Stack my knots, count a lot, saw a lot
Got them rocks, diamond rocks, whip the pot
Suicide, 1600, that's the block
Hit your girl, that's check-free
She ain't used to text me
Now she wanna caress me
She keep tryna neck me
I gotta tell my bestie
Someone call my bestie
Think I found my bestie
Link up, make a check bleed
You know that I'm smokin' dope, I'll be high 'til next week
Know I had to let her go 'cause she can't arrest me

We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go

I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (Love of my life)

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around

Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Woah, man, my neck so goddamn cold”
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

The AP goin' psycho, my Rollie goin' brazy
I'm hittin' lil' mama, she wanna have my babies
It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans, though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they're matching with the jewelry

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos

Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs somethin' to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say (Say)

I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes

We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it (Got it)
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (Wanted)
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner

I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)
I'm no good at goodbyes

I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My heart get possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered (Yeah)
And I don't want ya to never go outside (Outside)
I promise if they play, my niggas slidin' (Slidin')
I'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' (Ridin')
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I want you out of my head (Head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (Bedroom)
There's no way I could save you (Save you)
'Cause I need to be saved too (Saved too)

Lighting stog after stog, I choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my mama
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas

Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Uh, yeah, push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know what's about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands, I just wanna go

You're tellin' all your friends that I'm crazy
Like I'm the only one
Why'd you throw them stones if you
Had a wild hair of your own or two?
Livin' in your big glass house with a view
I thought you knew

I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
They say, "Teamwork makes the dream work," hell, I had some help (Help)

You thought I'd take the blame for us a-crumbling
Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'
Already lost the game that you been runnin'
Guess it's catchin' up to you, huh
You think that you're so innocent
After all the shit you did
I ain't an angel, you ain't heaven-sent
Can't wash our hands of this

But I got over what you did already
Body for a body, I’m so petty
How many of your friends fit in my Rolls? (Can you fit in my Rolls?)
Bought you a new face, you should call me "Dad," baby
Hermès, but you dropped the bag, baby
Truth is, maybe one's just not еnough

You say you love me, but I don't care

Oh

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew (Ice)
I brought up 10 hoes, this coupe only made for two (Yessir)
They all ran through it, it ain't nothin' left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening (Straight up)
I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone (Yeah)

Love (Love, yeah)
Shorty gon' back (Shorty gon, shorty gon' back)
Need it on sight (Need it on, need it on sight)
Crack it all back (Crack it all, crack it all back)
Give her that pipe (Give her that, give her that pipe)
All of my gang (All of my, all of my gang)
Shawty went bad (Shawty went, shawty went bad)

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

Take it all away
Why don't you (Take what you want, take what you need)
Take what you need from me, yeah

It's true that all that you know is all that you are
You said that it's all that you want and more
Fuck off and pour another drink
And tell me what you think
You know that I'm too drunk to talk right now
You put your cigarette out on my face
So beautiful, please, woman

Don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to—

Stay a little longer if you convince me
And tell me all the things that you have against me
Every time we make up, the truth is fadin'
Everybody's blind when the view's amazin'
Damn, who are we right now?
Can we have a little conversation?
Figure it out with no intoxication
We carry on, what is our motivation?
We're never wrong, how the hell we gonna make it?
Maybe we're used to this
Tell me, what are we to do?
It's like we only play to lose
Chasin' pain with an excuse
I love that shit and so do you

But don't break your back for me
I'll put you out of your misery

Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)
I've been waitin' on this all damn day (Waitin' on this all damn day)
Call me in the mornin', tell me how last night went
I'm here, but don't count on me to stay


Tell me that it's all okay (Tell me that it's all okay)

When I come back down, it doesn't feel the same
Now, I'm sittin' 'round waitin' for the world to end all day
'Cause I couldn't leave you if I tried

You break me, then I break my rules
Last time was the last time, too
It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still

Outside of the party, smokin' in the car with you
Seven-nation army fightin' at the bar with you
Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do
'Cause I can't let go, it's chemical
No, I can't let go, it's chemical

Every time I'm ready to make a change (Mmm)
You turn around and fuck out all my brains (Woo)
I ain't tryna fight fate, it's too late to save face
I can't get away, maybe there's no mistakes (Maybe there's no mistakes)

You break me, then I break my rules
Last time was the last time, too
It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still (Still)

Outside of the party, smokin' in the car with you
Seven-nation army fightin' at the bar with you
Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home

Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
It seem like dyin' young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle, blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go home

I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
We're scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're runnin' out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleedin', but we call it home

I've been looking for someone
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep it pouring
And I ain't seen the light of day since, well, that's not important, it's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winnin', you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze and I'm done

To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had eighty beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

To each their own and find peace in knowin'
Ain't always broken, but here's to hopin'
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

"Have you forgotten that once we were brought here, we were robbed of our name, robbed of our language? We lost our religion, our culture, our God... And many of us, by the way we act, we even lost our minds"
Here it is, bam
And you say, "Goddamn, this is the dope jam"
But let's define the term called dope
And you think it mean funky now, no
Here is a true tale
While the ones that deal are the ones that fail (Yeah!)
Yeah, you can move if you wanna move
What it prove? It's here like the groove
The problem is this, we gotta' fix it
Check out the justice, and how they run it
Selling, smelling, sniffing, riffing
And brothers try to get swift and
Sell their own, rob a home
While some shrivel to bone
Like comatose walking around
Please don't confuse this with the sound
I'm talking about

"Bass! Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba"
"Bass! Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba" (Yeah)
"Bass! Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

"One, two, three, four, five, six"
"Kick it!"
"Years ago"

I put this together to (rock) the bells of those that boost the dose
Of lack a lack, and those that sell to Black
Shame on a brother when he dealin'
The same block where my 98 be wheelin'
And everybody know, another kilo
From a corner from a brother keep another below
Stop illin' and killing, stop grillin'
Yo, Black, yo (We are willing!)
Four, five o'clock in the mornin'
Wait a minute, y'all, the fiends are fiendin'
Day to day, to day, they say no other way (Way, no way)
This stuff is really bad (Fee-fi-fo)

(First come, first serve basis)
Standing on line, checking the time, homeboys playing the curb
The same ones that used to do herb (Yo, Herb!)
Now they're gone, passing it on
Poison attack - the Black word bond (Word, word)
My man Daddy-O once said to me
He knew a brother that stayed all day in his Jeep
And at night he went to sleep
And in the morning, all he had was sneakers on his feet
The culprit used to jam and rock the mike
Yo, he stripped the Jeep to fill his pipe
And wander around to find a place
Where they rocked to a different kind of
Come on, y'all!

Show 'em that we can do this
Here we go again

Uh, your bad self
Help us break this down from off the shelf
Here's a music servin' you, so use it
Papa got a brand-new funk
Get down (Party for your right)
Huh, let's get it on like we said before
Say the brothers causing trouble, hate to bust their bubble
'Cause we rumble from our lower level
To condition your condition, we're gonna do a song
That you never heard before
Make you all jump along to the education
Brothers gonna work it out
And stop chasin'

Brothers gonna, brothers gonna work it out
Work it out, brothers gonna work it out (Come on)
Brothers, br-brothers gonna work it out
Work it out, brothers gonna work it out

You got it (What it takes)
Go get it (Where you want it?)
Go get it (Get involved)
'Cause the brothers in the street are willing to work it out

Come on, y'all, let's go to work

So many of us in limbo
How to get it on (Uh), it's quite simple
Three stones from the sun, we need a piece of this rock
Our goal, indestructible soul
Answers to this quizzing
To the brothers in the street, schools, and the prisons
History shouldn't be a mystery
Our story's real history, not his story
We gonna work it one day 'til we all get paid
The right way, in full, no bull
Talkin', no walkin', drivin', arrivin', and stylin'
Tell 'em soon you'll see what I'm talkin' 'bout (Yeah)
'Cause one day, the brothers gonna work it out

Brothers gonna, brothers gonna work it out
Work it out, brothers gonna work it out

Now we are ready if you are ready (Come on)
Yo, drop the rhyme in overtime, G

In 1995, you'll twist to this
As you raise your fist to the music
United, we stand, yes, divided, we fall
Together we can stand tall
Brothers that try to work it out
They get mad, revolt, revise, realize
They're super bad
Small chance a smart brother's gonna be a victim of his own circumstance
Sabotaged, shell-shocked
Rocked and ruled, day in the life of a fool
Like I said before to live it low
Life, take your time, time, yo, go slow
Lookie here, not a thing to fear
Brother to brother, not another as sincere
Teach a man how to be father
To never tell a woman he can't bother
You can't say you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
But one day on the strength, all the brothers gonna work it out

Brothers gonna, brothers gonna work it out
Work it out, brothers gonna work it out
Brothers, br-brothers gonna work it out
Work it out, brothers gonna work it out (Come on)
Brothers gonna, brothers gonna work it out
Work it out, brothers gonna work it out

Work it out, brothers gonna work it out

You got it (What it takes)
Go get it (Where you want it?)
Go get it (Get involved)
'Cause the brothers in the street are willing to work it out

Let's get it on (We are willing)
Let's get it on, let's get it on (We are willing)
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on (We are willing)
Come on (Huh)

With vice, I hold the mic device
With force, I keep it away of course
And I'm keeping you from sleeping
And on a stage, I rage, and I'm rollin'
And to the poor, I pour in on in metaphors
I'm not bluffing, it's nothing that we ain't did before
We played, you stayed, the points made
You consider it done by the prophets of rage

Yo, Griff, you and S1W's get to the East side
We gotta kick it to the East side, G!

I roll with the punches, so I survive
Try to rock 'cause it keeps the crowd alive
I'm not ballin', I'm just callin'
But I'm past the days of yes-y'allin'
I wiggle round and round, I pump, you jump up
Hear my words, my verbs and get (Juiced up, juiced up!)
I been around a while, you can't describe my sound

Ay yo Griff, we gotta get to my man Ralph in the South
Let's kick it to the South side, G!

I rang ya bell, can you tell I got feeling?
A just peace, at least, 'cause I want it
I want it so bad that I'm starving
I'm like Garvey, so can you see, B?
It's like that, I'm like Nat, leave me the hell alone
If you don't think I'm a brother, then check my chromosome
And then you check the stage, I declare it a new age
Get down for the prophets of rage

You back the track, you find we're the quotable
You emulate -- brothers, sisters, that's beautiful
Follow a path of positivity you go
Some sing it or rap it or harmonize it through go-go

I say it, you play it back in your car, even portable

Attack lies in the books that you're readin'
It's knowledge of yourself that you're needin'

(Yo, rock the acapella, G)
(Power of the people, say)

"You're quite hostile"

===== Public Enemy - By the time I get to arizona =====
39 ContributorsBy the Time I Get to Arizona Lyrics
This is Sister Souljah. Public Enemy, Security of the First World, and all allied forces are traveling west to head off a white supremacy scheming to destroy the national celebration of Martin Luther King's birthday. Public Enemy believes that the powers that be in the states of New Hampshire and Arizona have found psychological discomfort in paying tribute to a black man who tried to teach white people the meaning of civilization. Good luck brothers, show 'em what you got

I'm countin' down to the day deservin', fittin' for a king
I'm waitin' for the time when I can get to Arizona
'Cause my money is spent for the goddamn rent
Neither party is mine, not the jackass or the elephant
Twenty thousand niggy-niggy brothers in the corner
Of the cell block, but they come from California
Population is none in the desert and sun
With a gun cracker runnin' things under his thumb
Starin' hard at the postcards, isn't it odd and unique
Seein' people smile wild in the heat?
A hundred-twenty degree, 'cause I want to be free
What's a smilin' face when the whole state's racist?
Why I want a holiday? Damn it, 'cause I wanna
So what if I celebrate it standin' on a corner?
I ain't drinkin' no forty, thinkin' time with a nine
'Til we get some land, call me the trigger man
Lookin' for the governor, huh? He ain't lovin' ya, ha?
But here to trouble ya, he's rubbin' ya wrong
Get the point and come along, he can get to the joint
I urinated on the state while I was kickin' this song
Yeah, he appear to be fair
The sucker over there, he try to keep it yesteryear
The good ol' days, the same ol' ways that kept us dyin'
Yes - you, me, myself, and I, indeed
What he need is a nosebleed
Read between the lines, and then you see the lie
Politically planned, but understand, that's all she wrote
When we see the real side that hide behind the vote
And they can't understand why he the man, I'm singin' about a king
They don't like it when I decide to mic it
Wait, I'm waitin' for the date
For the man, who demands respect 'cause he was great, c’mon
I'm on a one mission to get a politician to honor
Or he's a goner by the time I get to Arizona

Well, I got 25 days to do it
If a wall in the way, just watch me go through it
'Cause I gotta do what I gotta do
PE number one, gets the job done
When it's done and over, was because I drove 'er
Through all the static, not stick but automatic
That's the way it is, he gotta get his, talkin' MLK
Gonna find a way
Make the state pay, I'm lookin' for the day
Hard as it seems, this ain't no damn dream
Gotta know what I mean, it's team against team
Catch the light beam

So I pray, I pray every day, I do and praise Jah the maker
Lookin' for culture I got, but not here from Jamaica
Pushin' and shakin' the structure, bringin' down the Babylon
Hearin' the sucker that make it hard for the Brown
The hard boulevard, I need it now more than ever now
Who's sittin' on my freedom, oppressor, people beater
A piece of the pick, we picked a piece of land that we're deserving now
Reparation, a piece of the nation, and damn, he got the nerve
Another nigga they say and classify we want too much
My people plus the whole nine is mine, don't think I even double dutch
Here's a brother, my attitude is hit 'em, hang 'em high
I'm blowing up the 90's, started tickin' in '86
When the blind get a mind, better start fearin' while we sing it now
There will be the day we know who's down and who will go
Go, go, go
By the time I get to Arizona

By the time I get to Arizona
By the time I get to Arizona
By the time I get to Arizona

===== Public Enemy - you're gonna get yours =====
30 ContributorsYou’re Gonna Get Yours Lyrics
Oh, Chuck, they out to get us, man
Yo, we got to dust these boys off

In this corner with the '98
Subject of suckers, object of hate
Who's the one some think is great?
I'm that one (son of a gun!)
Drivin' by wavin' my fist
Makin' 'em mad when I'm goin' like this
Top gun, never on the run
(They know not to come 'cause they all get some)
Goin' quicker in the speedin' lane
Jealous can't do it and it's causin' them pain
Caught in my smoke, all they did was choke
Look at my spokes, you know I'm no joke
Out that window, middle finger for all
Jealous at my ride, stereo and blackwalls
Suckers they got the nerve and gall
(To talk about the car when they're walkin' tall)

Suckers to the side, I know you hate my '98
(You're gonna get yours!)
Suckers to the side, I know you hate my '98
(You're gonna get yours!)

Pullin' away every day
Leavin' you in the dust so you know I get paid
On the mile ego trip and 5-0 tailin' on my tip
Watch me burn rubber, fall in my flame
This episode is always the same
Seein' no comp coming like I'm blind
All left back trailin' my behind
I go faster, cops try to shoot me
They'll get theirs when they try to get me
I'll let it go, my turbo
Run 'em in the river 'cause they're movin' too slow
Laughing hard at their attempt
So what if the judge charges me contempt?
I'd rub my boomerang 'cause I'm feelin' proud
And I wouldn't even hear 'em 'cause my radio's loud

Suckers to the side, I know you hate my '98
(You're gonna get yours!)
Suckers to the side, I know you hate my '98
(You're gonna get yours!)s

Cruisin' down the boulevard
I'm treated like some superstar
You know the time so don't look hard
(Get with it, the ultimate homeboy car!)
All you suckers in the other ride
Whenever I'm comin' get to my side
My '98 is tough to chase
If you're on my tail better watch your face
Smoke is comin' when I burn
Rubber when my wheels turn
Tinted windows, so super bad
Lookin' like the car the Green Hornet had
It's the reason I'm ahead of the pack
It's the reason I left them back
It's the reason all the people say
My '98 Olds blows 'em all away

My '98 Oldsmobile's so ("Su—" "Su—" "Su—")
My '98 Oldsmobile is ("Su—" "Su—" "Su—")
My '98 Oldsmobile's so ("Su—" "Su—" "Su—")
My '98 Oldsmobile's like ("Super sperm")

Suckers to the side, I know you hate my '98
(You're gonna get yours!)
Suckers to the side, I know you hate my '98
(You're gonna get yours!)

Understand, I don't drive drunk
My '98's fly, I don't drive no junk
No cop got a right to call me a punk
Take this ticket, go to hell and stick it
Put me on a kick but line up, time's up
This government needs a tune-up
I don't even know what's happenin', what's up?
Gun in my chest, I'm under arrest
Sidewalk suckers wanted to spill me
So I got my crew and posse
Took the girls and got them to thrill me
Stepped outside, got in my ride
Drove 'em around and I looked around town
Caught 'em out there cold, ran 'em over and down
They didn't get me and that's the truth
('Cause my '98-O is bulletproof)

My '98 Oldsmobile's so ("Su—" "Su—" "Su—")
My '98 Oldsmobile is ("Su—" "Su—" "Su—")
My '98 Oldsmobile's so ("Su—" "Su—" "Su—")
My '98 Oldsmobile's like ("Super sperm")

55 ContributorsWelcome to the Terrordome Lyrics
"Hey!"
"This—"
"This is a journey—"
"—jour—"
"—journey, through sound"
"Would you join me, please, in welcome-in-ing—"
"Hahahaha"

I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
Here's your ticket;
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black attack
So I sack and jack, then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it
(You know I like it) huh
Hear my favoritism roll "Oh"
Never be a brother like, "Me go solo"
Laser, anesthesia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm livin', forgiven, what I'm givin' up
X on the flex, hit me now
I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Yeah, I wear got 'em going in fear
Rhetoric said and read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Checkin' some ways (Ways)
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold, never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am, God knows, huh!
'Cause it's coming from the heart
What I got, better get some
Get on up, hustler of culture
Snake bitten, been spit in the face, huh!
But the rhymes keep fittin'
Respect's been given, how's ya livin'
Now I can't protect, a paid-off defect
Check the record and reckon an intentional wreck
Played, off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall, broke the laws
Not my fault that they're fallin' off
Known as fair and square throughout my years
So I growl at the livin' foul
Black to the bone, my home is your home
But welcome to the Terrordome

Come on down, get down
(Come on, you can get it, get it, get it)
Come on down, get down
(Come on, you can get it, get it, get it)
Come on down, get down
(Come on, you can get it, get it, get it)
Come on down, get down
(Come on, you can get it, get it, get it)
"Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing..."

So long now, have a good trip!
Yo, yo, who put this thing together, huh? Me!
Me, that's who!
Who I trust? Who I trust?
Me, that's who!
Yo, who you trust, man?

Subordinate terror, kickin' off an era
Cold deliverin' pain
My '98 was '87 on a record, yo
So now I go Bronco
(Oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Yo, we gotta dust these boys off!)
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother 'cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag from the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say, I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never knew or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basin'
Traits of hate, who's celebratin' with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous, bobbin' and weavin'
And let the good get even
C'mon down (C'mon!)
But welcome to the Terrordome

Come on down
Ohhh (Get down)
(Come on, you can get it, get it, get it)
Come on down
Ohhh (Get down)
(Come on, you can get it, get it, get it)

Caught in the race against time, the pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes while I'm bending 'em
Snakes blowing up the lines of design (Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing...)
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power, cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game, a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
'Cause a black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig

Come on down
Come on down
(Come on)
"Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing..."

It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First, nothin' worse
Than a mother's pain of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example, one of many places
Greek, week-end, speech, I speak
From a lesson, learned in Virginia
I don't smile in the line of fire, I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums, even violins
Whatcha do, getcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad, I put it down on a pad, huh!
Give ya something that ya never had
Controllin', fear of high rollin'
God bless your soul and keep livin'
Never allowed, kickin' it loud
Droppin' a bomb, brain game, intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team, never move alone
But welcome to the Terrordome

45 ContributorsCan’t Truss It Lyrics
(Confusion)
Here come the drums
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah
Alright, alright
Here come the drums
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright, alright

Bass in your face, not an eight track
Gettin' it good to the wood
So the people give you some of that reactin' to the facts
That I kick and it stick and it stay around
Pointin' to the joint, put the Buddha down
Goin, goin, deep to the roots
Ain't givin' it up, so turn me loose
But then again I got a story that's harder than the hardcore
Cost of the holocaust, I'm talkin' 'bout the one still goin' on
I know where I'm from, not dum diddie dum
From the base motherland, the place of the drum
Invaded by the wack diddie wack
And fooled the black, and left us faded
King and chief, probably had a big beef
Because of that now I grit my teeth
So here's a song to the strong
'Bout the shake of the snake and the smile went along
With that, can't truss it

You can't truss it
Let them know
You can't truss it
Yo, let them know
You can't truss it
Let them know

Kickin' wicked rhymes like a fortune teller
Cause the wickedness done by Jack
Where everybody at divided and sold
For liquor and the gold
Smacked in the back for the other man to mack

What?
Wicked man, wicked man
Get back, step back, kick it man

Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory
Little Rock where they be dockin' this boat
No hope, I'm shackled, oh plus, gang tackled
By the other hand swingin' the rope "god damn"
Wearin' red, white and blue, Jack and his crew
The guy's authorized beat down for the brown
Man to the man, each one, so I teach one
Born to terrorize sisters and every brother
One love who said it, I know Whodini sang it
But the hater taught hate that's why we gang bang it
Beware of the hand when it's comin' from the left
I ain't trippin, just watch your step
Can't truss it

Can't truss it
Yo, let them know
Can't truss it
Yo, let them know
Can't truss it
Yo, let them know
Can't truss it, can't truss it
Can't truss it, can't truss it
Can't truss it, can't truss it

And I'll judge everyone, one by the one
Look here comes the judge, watch it here he come now
(Don't sentence me judge, I ain't did nothin' to nobody)
I can only guess what's happenin'
Years ago he woulda been the ship's captain
Gettin' me bruised on a cruise, what I got to lose
Lost all contact, got me layin' on my back
Ugh, rollin' in my own leftover
When I roll over, I roll over in somebody else
90 damn days on a slave ship
Count them fallin' off 1, 2, 3, 4 hundred at a time
Blood in the wood and it's mine
I'm chokin' on, spit, feelin' pain
Like my brain bein' chained
Still gotta give it what I got
But it's hot in the day, it's cold in the night
But I thrive to survive, I pray to god to stay alive
My attitude boils up inside
And that ain't it, you think I ever quit
Still I plan to get my hands around the neck of the man with the whip
3 months passed, they brand a label on my ass
To signify I'm owned, I'm on the microphone
Sayin' 1555, how I'm livin'
We been livin' here, livin' ain't the word, I been givin'
Haven't got, classify us in the have-nots
Fightin' haves cause it's all about money "damn"
When it comes to Armageddon mean I'm getting mine
Here I am turn it over Sam
427 to the year, do you understand
That's why it's hard for the black to love the land

Once again, bass in your face, not an eight track
Gettin' it good to the wood
So the people give you some of that reactin' to the facts
That I kick and it stick and it stay around
Pointin' to the joint, put the Buddha down
Goin, goin, gettin' to the roots
Ain't givin' it up, so turn me loose
But then again I got a story that's harder than the hardcore
Cost of the holocaust, I'm talkin' 'bout the one still goin' on
I know where I'm from, not dum diddie dum
From the base motherland, the place of the drum
Invaded by the wack diddie wack

Can't truss it, can't truss it
You can't truss it, you can't truss it
You can't truss it, you can't truss it
You can't truss it, you can't truss it
You can't truss it, you can't truss it

("Now here's what I want y'all to do for me")
Back, caught you lookin' for the same thing
It's a new thing, check out this I bring
Uh, oh, the roll below the level, 'cause I'm livin' low
Next to the bass, (C'mon!), turn up the radio
They claiming I'm a criminal
But now I wonder how, some people never know
The enemy could be their friend, guardian
I'm not a hooligan, I rock the party and
Clear all the madness, I'm not a racist
Preach to teach to all ('Cause, some, they never had this)
Number one, not born to run, about the gun
I wasn't licensed to have one
The minute they see me, fear me
I'm the epitome of "public enemy"
Used, abused without clues

So here it is again, another def jam
But since I gave you all a little something that I knew you lacked
They still consider me a new jack
All the critics, you can hang 'em, I'll hold the rope
But they hope to the Pope, and pray it ain't dope
The follower of Farrakhan
Don't tell me that you understand until you hear the man
The book of the new school rap game
Writers treat me like Coltrane, insane
Yes to them, but to me I'm a different kind
We're brothers of the same mind, unblind
Caught in the middle and not surrendering
I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
Some claim that I'm a smuggler
Some say I never heard of ya, a rap burglar
False media, we don't need it, do we?
(It's fake that's what it be to ya, dig me?
Yo, Terminator X, step up on the stand

My '98 booming with a trunk of funk
All the jealous punks can't stop the dunk
Coming from the school of hard knocks
Some perpetrate, they drink Clorox
Attack the Black, because I know they lack exact
The cold facts, and still they try to Xerox
The leader of the new school, uncool
Never played the fool, just made the rules
Remember there's a need to get alarmed
Again I said I was a time bomb
In the daytime radio's scared of me
'Cause I'm mad, plus I'm the enemy
They can't come on and play me in prime time
'Cause I know the time, 'cause I'm getting mine
I get on the mix late in the night
They know I'm living right, so here go the mic—sike
Before I let it go, don't rush my show
You try to reach and grab and get elbowed
Word to Herb, yo, if you can't swing this
Learn the words, you might sing this
Just a little bit of the taste of the bass for you
As you get up and dance at the LQ
When some deny it, defy it, I swing Bolos
And then they clear the lane I go solo
The meaning of all of that, some media is the wack
As you believe it's true
It blows me through the roof
Suckers, liars, get me a shovel
Some writers I know are damn devils
From them I say, don't believe the hype
(Yo, Chuck, they must be on the pipe, right?)
Their pens and pads I'll snatch 'cause I've had it
I'm not a addict fiending for static
I'll see their tape recorder, and I grab it
(No, you can't have it back, silly rabbit)
I'm going to my media assassin

Yo, Griff get the green, black and red, and

Put the left in effect, and I still will
Rock the hard jams, treat it like a seminar
Reach the bourgeois and rock the boulevard
Some say I'm negative, but they're not positive
But what I got to give, (The media says this?)
Red, black, and green, you know what I mean?

Yo, don't believe that hype
They got to be beaming that pipe, you know what I'm saying?
Yo, them Megas got 'em going up to see Captain Kirk
Like a jerk, and they outta work
Let me tell you a little something, man:
A lot of people on daytime radio scared of us
Because they too ignorant to understand the lyrics of the
Truth that we pumping into them clogged-up brain cells
That just spun their little wooden skulls they call caps
You know what I'm saying?
But the S1s'll straighten it out quick-fast, in a hurry
Don't worry, Flavor vision ain't blurry, you know what I'm saying?
Yo, Terminator X

Black people died when the other man lied
See the TV, listen to me, double trouble
I overhaul and I'm coming from the lower level
I'm taking tabs, sho nuff, stuff to grab
Like shirts and it hurts with a neck to wreck
Took a poll 'cause our soul took a toll
From the education of a TV station
But look around, here go the sound of the wrecking ball
Boom and pound when I shut 'em down
I shut 'em down (Shut 'em down, shut 'em, shut 'em down)

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine
What I use in the battle for the mind
Hit it hard like it suppose, pull no blows to the nose
Like Uncle L said, I'm rippin' up shows
Then what it is is only five percent of the biz, I'm adding woes
That's the way it goes
Then you think I rank I never drank, point blank
I own loans, suckers got me running from the bank
Civil liberty, I can't see to pay a fee
I never saw a way to pay a sap to read the law
Then become a victim of a lawyer
Don't know ya, never saw ya
Tape cued, getting me sued
Playing games with my head, what the judge said
Put me in the red, got me thinking 'bout a trigger to the lead
No, no, my educated mind say
Suckers gonna pay anyway, there gonna be a day
Cause the troop they roll in, to posse up whole from the ground
Ready to go, throw another round
Sick of the ride, it's suicide for the other side of town
When I find a way to shut 'em down

I shut 'em down (Shut 'em down, shut 'em, shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (Shut 'em down, shut 'em, shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (Shut 'em down, shut 'em, shut 'em down)

I shut 'em down (Shut 'em down, shut 'em, shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (Shut 'em down, shut 'em, shut 'em down)

Hold it! Come on!
Alright, y'all! Alright, y'all!
Come on, now!
Hey!

Who count the money in the neighborhood?
But we spending money to no end, looking for a friend
In a war to the core, ripping up the poor in the stores
Until they get a brother kicking down doors
Then I figure I can get bigger, look 'em dead in the eye
And they wince, defense is pressurized
They don't really want it to be another racial attack
In disguise, so give some money back
I like Nike, but wait a minute
The neighborhood supports, so put some money in it
All corporations owe, they gotta give up the dough
To my town or else we gotta shut 'em down

I shut 'em down (Shut 'em down, shut 'em, shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (Shut 'em down, shut 'em, shut 'em down)
I shut 'em down (Shut 'em down, shut 'em, shut 'em down)

36 ContributorsBurn Hollywood Burn Lyrics
Burn Hollywood burn I smell a riot
Goin' on -- first they're guilty, now they're gone
Yeah I'll check out a movie
But it'll take a Black one to move me
Get me the hell away from this T.V
All this news and views are beneath me
So all I hear about is shots ringing out
About gangs putting each other's head out
So I rather kick some slang out
All right fellas let's go hang out
Hollywood or would they not
Make us all look bad like I know they had
But some things I'll never forget, yeah
So step and fetch this shit
For all the years we looked like clowns
The joke is over -- smell the smoke from all around
Burn Hollywood burn

Ice Cube is down with the P.E
Now every single bitch wanna see me
Big Daddy is smooth, word to mother
Let's check out a flick that exploits the color
Roaming through Hollywood late at night
Red and blue lights what a common sight
Pulled to the curb, getting played like a sucker
Don't fight the power *gunshot* the motherfucker

As I walk the streets of Hollywood Boulevard
Thinking how hard it was to those that starred
In the movies portraying the roles
Of butlers and maids, slaves and hoes
Many intelligent Black men seemed
To look uncivilized when on the screen
Like, I guess I figure you to play some jigaboo
On the plantation, what else can a nigga do
And Black women in this profession
As for playing a lawyer, out of the question
For what they play Aunt Jemima is the perfect term
Even if now she got a perm
So let's make our own movies like Spike Lee
Cause the roles being offered don't strike me
As nothing that the black man could use to earn
Burn Hollywood burn
"Now we're considering you for a part in our new production. How do you feel about playing a controversial negro?"
"Yeah, I'm wid it. You mean somebody like Huey P. Newton or H. Rap Brown, right?"
"Well, it's a servant character that chuckles a little bit, and sings."
"Yo, man, what?? That's bullshit."
"Hey Cube, Kane, Flav, listen. I hope you ain't wastin' my time. You know how I feel about givin' these movies my money, know what I'm sayin'?  I work hard for it"
"Yo, man, it's gonna be dope, man."
"Chill, man."
"Hey, I'm chill chill, but you know what I'm sayin', I just don't wanna, I can't go for this Steel Magnolia shit, know what I'm sayin'?"
"Come on, man, it's cool."
Ladies and gentlemen, today's feature presentation: Driving Miss Daisy
"No, no, no."
"Bullshit, just what I'm talkin' about, all this Terms of Endearment shit. I'm outta here, man, it's bullshit."
"Yo, check it out, man I got Black Caesar at the crib, man, y'all want to go check that out?"
"That's the idea. We could have rolled with that from the get-go!"
"Fuck Hollywood, man."

===== Public Enemy - Black Steel In the hour of chaos =====
67 ContributorsBlack Steel in the Hour of Chaos Lyrics
Bass for your face, London!
Everybody in the house, make some noise!
I want everybody in the house to say, "Ho!" (Ho!)
Yo Chuck, kick it to 'em, man!
"A ballad behind bars, or you could say real rock from the rock. An unusual musical happening in a most unusual place. The state prison..."
"Get in that cell, nigga!"
I got a letter from the government the other day
I opened and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn, I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself because they never did
I wasn't with it, but just that very minute it occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweating as I dwell in my cell, how long has it been?
They got me sitting in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun to be another one
(Word) Public enemy serving time
They drew the line, y'all, to criticize me for some crime
Nevertheless, they could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm looking for the steel

They got me rotting in the time that I'm serving
Telling you what happened the same time they're throwing
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves, oh well
The same motherfucker got us living in his hell
You have to realize, what is a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up - word 'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway, and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust, yo
Some do a bid from 1 to 10
But I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked, I never clock it, y'all
'Cause time and time again
Time, they got me serving to those, to them I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a C-O
Sleeping on the job, my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal
I got nothing to lose
'Cause I'm going for the steel

Don't you know I caught a C-O
Falling asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun, and he did what I said so
And every man's demand got served
Along with the time they served, decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warning, I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fucking up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like Oliver's neck, I had to get off
My boys had the feds in check
They couldn't try nothing
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This what it takes for peace
So I just took a piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out to the ghetto, no sell out
6 C-Os we got, we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, 'cause I'm civilized
As for rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell, I'm a rebel, so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinking like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right? Now who wanna get nice?
I had 6 C-Os, and now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious, call me delirious
But I'm still a captive, I gotta wrap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand, now I'm looking for the fence

As I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by 52 brothers, bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Going out with a bang, ready to bang out
But power from the sky, from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose, yes, and some came close
I figure I trigger my steel, I still stand and hold my post
This is what I mean, an anti-nigga machine
If I come out alive, then they won't come clean
Then I threw up, my steel bullets flew up
And to my surprise the water tower blew up, who shot
What, who, what, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just got away
The joint broke from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher than the average bluffer
'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on, telling you to c'mon
53 brothers on the run, and we are gone

===== Public Enemy - Public Enemy no.1 =====
27 ContributorsPublic Enemy No. 1 Lyrics

Yo Chuck, bust a move man
I was on my way up here to the studio, you know what I'm saying?
And this brother stopped me and asked me, "Yo, what's up with that brother Chuckie D, he swear he nice?"
I said, "Yo, the brother don't swear he nice, he knows he's nice", you know what I'm saying?
So Chuck, we got a feeling you turning into a Public Enemy, man
Now remember that line you was kicking to me on the way out to L.A. Laurelton Queens while we was in the car on our way to the shop?
Well yo, right now, kick the bass for them brothers and let 'em know... What, goes, on!
What goes on? Well...

I'm all in, put it up on the board
Another rapper shot down from the mouth that roared
One, two, three, down for the count
The result of my lyrics, oh yes, no doubt
Cold rock rap, forty-niner supreme
Is what I choose and I use, I never lose to a team
'Cause I can go solo like a Tyson bolo
Make the fly girls wanna have my photo
Run in their room, hang it on the wall
In remembrance that I rocked them all
Suckers, ducks, ho-hum emcees
You can't rock the kid, so go cut the cheese
Take this application of rhymes like these
My rap's red hot, hundred ten degrees
So don't start bassing, I'll start placing
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
You and your mind from my beating from my rhymes
A time for a crime that I can't find
I'll show you my gun, my Uzi weighs a ton
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

One, one, one
One, one, one, one!
(One, one, one, hoo-hah!)

You got no rap, but you want to battle
It's like having a boat, but you've got no paddle
'Cause I never pause, I say it because
I don't break in stores, but I break all laws
Written while sitting, all bidding not hidden
Giving me the juice that you're not getting
I'm not a law obeyer, so you can tell your mayor
I'm a non-stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the rhyme player, the ozone layer
A battle what? Here's a bible, start your prayer
This word to the wise is justified
If they ask you what happened, just admit you lied
You just got caught up for going out of order
And now you're serving football teams their water
You messed with the Master, word to Chuck
And I waxed cold taxed, make sure you got dunked
You just got dissed, all but dismissed
Sucker duck emcees, you get me pissed
It's no fun being on the run
Because they got me Public Enemy number one

One, one, one
One, one, one, one!
Don't you know, don't you know

I got a posse of a force to back me up
Watch out, we got mettle to match
Ambush attack on my back, double-team you get creamed
So we have it, so you won't catch
Wanna hear it again? We got a force, enemy down
The L.I. circuit sound
And Chuckie D, myself, and K-Jee
Flavor, DJ Melo-D
Oh yes, I presume it's the tunes that make us groom
To make all the ladies swoon
But it's also the words from our direction, the homeboy section
Kicking like Bruce Lee's "Chinese Connection"
On stereo, never ever mono
On wax, yes, I'm talking about vinyl
They said "Stop! Freeze!", I got froze up
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

One, one, one
One, one, one
One, one, one!
For all you

Suckers, liars, your cheap amplifiers
Your crossed up wires are always starting fires
You grown up criers, now here's a pair of pliers
Get a job like your mother, heard she fixes old dryers
You have no desires, your father fixes tires
You try to sell your equipment but you get no buyers
It's you they never hire, you're never on flyers
'Cause you and your crew is only known as good triers
Known as the poetic, political, lyrical son
I'm Public Enemy number one

One, one, one
One, one, one
One, one, one!

Yeah, that's right Chuck, man
That's what you gotta do
You gotta tell 'em just like that, you know what I'm saying
'Cause yo man, let me tell you a little something man
These brothers running around, hard headed
They get a little jealous, you know what I'm saying
Just like that, you know, they're trying to bring you down with them
But yo Chuck, you got to let them know who's who in the world to be
You got to let them know, that this is the 80's
And we can get all the ladies
And in the backyard we got a fly Mercedes
And that's the way the story goes
That's just the way the story goes
Let me tell you a little something man

===== Public Enemy - Rebel Without A pause =====
69 ContributorsRebel Without a Pause Lyrics
"Brothers and sisters! Brothers and sisters, I don't know what this world is coming to!"

Yes, the rhythm, the rebel
Without a pause, I'm lowering my level
The hard rhymer -- where you never been, I'm in
You want stylin'? You know it's time again
D, the enemy, tellin' you to hear it
They praised the music, this time they play the lyrics
Some say no to the album, The Show
Bum Rush, the sound -- I made a year ago
I guess you know, you guess I'm just a radical
Not on sabbatical, yes, to make it critical
The only party your body should be partyin' to
Panther power on the hour from the rebel to you

Ay yo, Chuck, man, I don't understand this, man!
Yo, you got to slow down, man, you losin' them!

Radio—suckers never play me
On the mix, they just okay me
Now, known and grown, when they're clocking my zone, it's known
Snaking and taking everything that a brother owns
Hard — my calling card
Recorded and ordered, supporter of Chesimard
Loud and proud, kicking live next, poet supreme
Loop a troop, bazooka, the scheme
(Flavor) A rebel in his own mind
Supporter of my rhyme
Designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim I do crime
They on my time ticket

Ay yo, Chuck, they think we takin' shorts!
Show 'em this is cold medina, man!
Come on, kick it!

Terminator X, Terminator X
Terminator X, Terminator

Yo, Chuck, you gettin' 'em nervous
They can't handle this, they gonna break down!

From a rebel, it's final on black vinyl
Soul, rock and roll coming like a rhino
Tables turn, suckers burn to learn
They can't disable the power of my label
Def Jam, tells you who I am
The enemy's public, they really give a damn
Strong Island, where I got 'em whylin'
That's the reason they're claiming that I'm violent
Never silent, no dope, getting dumb — nope
Claiming where we get our rhythm from
Number one, we hit ya, and we give ya some
No gun, and still never on the run
You wanna be an S1 -- Griff will tell you when
And then you'll come again, you'll know what time it is
Impeach the president, pulling out my ray gun
Zap the next one, I could be your Shogun
(Suckers) don't last a minute
Soft and smooth, I ain't with it
(Hardcore) raw bone like a razor
I'm like a laser, I just won't graze ya
Old enough to raise ya, so this'll faze ya
Get it right, boy, maybe I will praise ya
Playing the role, I got soul too
Voice my opinion with volume
(Smooth) Not what I am
(Rough) 'Cause I'm a man
No matter what the name, we're all the same
Pieces in one big chess game
(Yeah!) The voice of power
Is in the house — go take a shower, boy
P.E. a group, a crew — not singular
We wear black Wranglers
We're rap stranglers, you can't angle us
I know you're listening
I caught you pissin' your pants
You're scared of dissing us
The crowd is missing us
We're on a mission y'all

Yo Chuck, yo! Yeah, man!
Yo, you got 'em runnin' scared!

Terminator X, Terminator X
Terminator X, Terminator

Attitude, when I'm on fire
Juice on the loose, electric wire
Simple and plain, give me the lane
I'll throw it down your throat like Barkley
You see my car keys, you'll never get these
They belong to the Nine-Eight posse
You want some more, son? You wanna get some?
Bum-rush the door of the store — pick up the album
You know the rhythm, the rhyme plus the beat is designed
So I can enter your mind, boys!
Bring the noise — my time
Step aside for the flex, Terminator X

Yeah, that's right
This jam is rated cold medina, boy
That's right, cold medina, that's right
We showin' up in E-F-F-E-C-T, also known as effect
You understand what I'm sayin'?

Yeah! Yeah, boy!
Bring that beat back
Bring that beat back one more time, Chuck
Y'all wanna hear that beat, right?
Bring that beat back

===== Public Enemy - Fight the power =====
105 ContributorsFight the Power Lyrics
Yet our best-trained, best-educated, best-equipped, best-prepared troops refuse to fight
Matter of fact, it's safe to say that they would rather switch than fight

1989 the number, another summer (Get down)
Sound of the funky drummer
Music hittin' your heart 'cause I know you got soul
Brothers and sisters (Hey, hey)
Listen if you're missin', y'all
Swingin' while I'm singin' (Hey), givin' what you're gettin'
Knowin' what I know and while the Black band's sweatin'
And the rhythm-rhyme rollin'
Got to give us what we want (Uh)
Gotta give us what we need (Hey, haha, hey)
Our freedom of speech is freedom of death
We've got to fight the powers that be

(Let me hear you say)
Fight the power (Let me hear you—)
Fight the power (Let me hear you say)
Fight the power (Let me hear you—)
Fight the power (Let me hear you say)
Fight the power (Let me hear you—)
Fight the power (Let me hear you say)
Fight the power (Let me hear you—)
We've got to fight the powers that be

As the rhythm's designed to bounce, what counts
Is that the rhyme's designed to fill your mind
Now that you've realized the pride's arrived
We got to pump the stuff to make you tough
From the heart, it's a start, a work of art
To revolutionize, make a change, nothing's strange
People, people, we are the same
No, we're not the same 'cause we don't know the game
What we need is awareness, we can't get careless
You say, "What is this?"
My beloved, let's get down to business, mental self-defensive fitness
Bum-rush the show
You got to go for what you know
To make everybody see
In order to fight the powers that be

(Let me hear you say)
Fight the power (Let me hear you—)
Fight the power (Let me hear you say)
Fight the power (Let me hear you—)
Fight the power (Let me hear you say)

Elvis was a hero to most, but he—
Elvis was a hero to most—
Elvis was a hero to most, but he never meant— to me
You see, straight-out racist, that sucker was simple and plain
Mother**** him and John Wayne
'Cause I'm Black and I'm proud, I'm ready, I'm hyped, plus, I'm amped
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps
Sample a look back, you look and find nothing
But rednecks for four hundreds years if you check
"Don't Worry Be Happy" was a number-one jam
Damn, if I say it, you can slap me right here
Get it, let's get this party started right

124 ContributorsAston Martin Music Lyrics
Oh
Let's pull the two-seater out baby
It's where ever you wanna go!
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing

When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space
In my two-seater she's the one that I would take, wee

Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the, Aston Martin Music, Music

Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing

Pull up on the block in a drop-top chicken box
Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100

Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin' the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urgin' all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin' on me to be there like missin' rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin' like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin' shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin' shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with
Fuck is up?
Havin' lunch and debatin' Ferrari prices
Twenty-three and goin' through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not sayin' I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg

Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg

Damn, life's so short
Fuck it, I don't wanna go to court (Huh!)
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer, though
Fuck it, I'm on the run for the month (Woo!)
I'm in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil' niggas thuggin', even got me paranoid (Huh!)
I'm gettin' money, that's in any nigga category
Double M, I got Gs out in California (Huh!)

Stay schemin' (Yeah), niggas tryna get at me, dawg
(Young Frankie Geechi Liberace, yeah)
I ride for my niggas

It bothers me when the gods get to actin' like the broads
Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don't be duckin' like you never wanted nothin'
It's feelin' like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from D.C., that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million-dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North, that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty Ms
Kobe my nigga, I hate it had to be him
Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym
(Huh! Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym)
Tell Lucian I said "fuck it," I'm tearin' holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix, and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet, told 'em, "Butterfly it, she'll love it."
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin' my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fuckin' finish line; we can't wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker gettin' mine off rap, with my niggas (Huh!)

I ride for my niggas, dawg
I ride for my niggas (Maybach Music)
I slide for my niggas, dawg (Dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg
I ride for my niggas

From the hoopty coupe to that Ghost, dawg (Huh)
Pigeons on the roof like Ghost Dog (Huh)
Dwight Howard on the post, dawg (Huh)
My niggas got the powder through the post, dawg (Huh)
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head (Huh)
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the feds (Huh)
Ten grams off my last 250 now (Huh)
Big-ass crib, 250 down, damn!
Gave my nigga Max 7-5 (Huh)
Then gave my nigga Penthouse another 30 (Huh)
Fuck it, got me thinkin' like I'm 7-5 (Huh)
Damn, nigga ain't even seen 30

Huh, I ride for my niggas, dawg

Yeah
I'm home now, it's over now, so...
Yeah

She got a thing for Chanel vintage that dropped before she could speak English
Do you love me or love seekin' attention, I mean which one is it?
You keep callin' me ya twin, but twins ain't this different
Mentally I'm already on next year, that's some 20/20 clear vision
You sayin' let you finish, I ain't tryna hear it
I'm all for spiritual liftin', but I don't fly Spirit
I'm all for findin' happiness, but down to die serious
All smiles, Kevin Durant trials
Had to blow it on the court, I must have blew a milli'
I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles
I know they love to rock a check, but who gon' do it really? Really?
My depositions never surface
Tanenbaum know the logo on the jersey, it's gettin' purchased
Ten years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses
Paid the cost to be the boss wasn't even my most expensive purchase
Trust when I say I'm never on the shit they assumin' I'm on
Tales about me are like corridos in Culiacán
Sashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star
Postcard from Grace Bay, sendin' my distant regards
Vision wasn't mine, told my niggas the vision was ours
Still a part of shorty even if we've been livin' apart
Roxx'll do you filthy for me soon as I give him the nod
Meanin' he'll blast for me like puttin' the 6 with the God
Hop on a float to show the city the one they appointed
The one that's rebuildin' schools and feedin' the homeless
Hang with my niggas, but sometimes I be tryna avoid it
'Cause they'll get to poppin' out of place like they double jointed
Goals was the top of the pyramid in this shitty world
"I gotta get the most of everything" is the axis on which it sit and twirls
Point blank period, like a City Girl and then I bring it back to 50 world

Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, it's too late
This different right here, yo

I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand, they'll never understand me
Lot of lives lost, but I never panicked
Lot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny
A hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned
Love makin' love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us
But they speakin' on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Love givin' back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for women on face
I know it seem odd, but money amazin'
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil
Livin' on the edge, she keepin' me level
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever (Forever)
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
I'll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin' on your hands, your body's a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, ménages with bitches
Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest (Biggest, biggest)
(Maybach Music)

Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)

Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasn't actin' right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin' light
You movin' funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas' conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of 'em parked
Your niggas' money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, that's not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock 'em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'
Bitch, we on the real, it's time to stop talkin' (Stop talkin', stop talkin')

Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)

Masterminds! We gon' get this forever
You know whenever we link up, my nigga
They think this shit comes from outer space or something, haha
Nigga, let’s get this money nigga, woo, woo
Masterminds, R-O-C, double M-G!
Jay, I got it, I got it

Four stacks for the heels on my bitch feet
Car seats still smelling like 10 ki's
Tell the plug that I'm lookin' for an increase
Wingstop, fat boy need a 10 piece
Say a nigga name and the car start
Nigga switching lane to lane like Wal-Mart
Sippin' Bordeaux out in Bordeaux
Hazard lights flashing on the four-door
Switch the Benzo for the Enzo
Back to the Benzo when the ends low
Switch my old bitch for my new bitch
Cause my new bitch something like a nympho
Fuck the game raw when I came in it
Getting money ever since I came in it
You couldn't stop me if you tried
Motherfucker cause the devil is a lie

Big guns and big whips
Rich nigga talkin' big shit
Double cup, gold wrist
Double up on that blow, bitch!
Two mill' on that I-95
Bow your head cause it's time to pay tithes
Opposition want me dead or alive
Motherfucker, but the devil is a lie
The devil is a lie, bitch I'm the truth
The devil is a lie, bitch I'm the proof
The devil is a lie, the devil is a lie
Bitch I'm alive, the devil is a lie

Two kings on the big screen
Niggas seen a 36 at 16
100K for the 16
Nigga's stick dirty but his dick clean
My money goin' on the deep end
Talkin' half a milli' for the weekend
Contract like a nigga play defense
Curtains in the Maybach bitch peek in
Now the bitches wanna car hop
6 cribs for the cars in the car lot
Dope boys on the goal nigga
Went gold 6 times for a gold digger
Black bottle and a bad bitch
Club Armani where the cash is
Dubai I can do it like a sheikh
Top floor nigga, Burj Khalifa!

Big guns and big whips
Rich nigga talkin' big shit
Double cup, gold wrist
Double up on that blow, bitch!
Two mill' on that I-95
Bow your head cause it's time to pay tithes
Opposition want me dead or alive
Motherfucker, but the devil is a lie
The devil is a lie, bitch I'm the truth
The devil is a lie, bitch I'm the proof
The devil is a lie (I got 'em, Ricky!)
The devil is a lie
Bitch I'm alive, the devil is a lie
Is it truth or it's fiction, is it truth or it's fiction?
Is Hova atheist? I never fuck with True Religion
Am I down with the devil 'cause my roof come up missin'?
Is that Lucifer juice in that two cup he sippin'?
That's D'usse baby welcome to the dark side
Coulda got blacklist for the crack shit
White Jesus in my crock pot
I mix the shit with some soda
Now I'm black Jesus turn water to wine
And all I had to do was turn the stove up
Beast Coast, winnin' at life, nigga, cheat code
The hatin' is flagrant, hit your free throws
The devil try to hit me with the RICO, them black people
Devil want these niggas hate they own kind
Gotta be Illuminati if a nigga shine
Oh we can't be a nigga if a nigga rich?
Oh we gotta be the devil that's some nigga shit
You seen what I did to the stop and frisk
Brooklyn on the Barney's like we own the bitch
Give the money to the hood, now we all win
Got that Barney's floor lookin' like a VIM
Black hoodie, black skully
Bravado like Mavado, boy I'm that gully
Gettin white money but I'm still black
All these niggas claiming king but I'm still that

===== Rick Ross - Push It =====
37 ContributorsPush It Lyrics
Push it to the limit

Port of Miami (uhh), I'm importin' the candy (uhh)
Ain't got nothin' to lose, we supportin' the family
Never traffic for fun, only traffic for funds
All I seen is the struggle, it's like I'm trapped in the slums
Workers were barely paid, no water, we barely bathe
There better be better days on the way that's on my daddy grave
I'm pushin' it hard, I'm pushin' it soft
If he pushin' a line, he pushin' for Ross
I waited and waited, I done ran out of patience
They hated and hated, left him slow dancin' with Satan
Fresh in my white tee, Mac-11, swear to God
I bought my first block, broke it down and tore the block apart

I push and I push, I ride and I ride
Tryna survive on 95
Put it all on the line every drop of a dime
I be pushin' them whips, yep, three at time
I'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)
II'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)

I handle dope like a vandal off the banana boat
Bananas in our rifles, no cyphers, I'm just the man to know
I paid dues, my moves done made news
I'm smooth, my suede shoes they new like Ray shoes
Nobody used to speak, now e'rybody wave
You duck your momma house, you set your sister straight
I'm buildin' a dream, with elevators in it
Tailor made the linen, no gators got on my hater-vision
I see ya, I see ya suckers, I see ya clear
I know you see me in that Phantom whiter than veneers
Allergic to broke, determined to blow
On the boat we hid the work in detergent and soap
We ship it from Haiti, baby I'm whippin' them babies
Let it dry, let it dry, try to whip a Mercedes
Arrangin' my Range, here to rain ya parade
You gotta push it to the limit you wanna be paid

I push and I push, I ride and I ride
Tryna survive on 95 (Push it to the limit)
Put it all on the line every drop of a dime
I be pushin' them whips, yep, three at time
I'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)
II'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)

We started minute, the money matured
My money's secured, I got bundles in Europe
My bubble be pure, it cost like a hundred a pull
The world is yours, hundred million or more
Now I run the streets, they all mine
12 years overdue, call it due time
I told you never roll on the soul of a soldier
You never know that dishwasher may be the beholder
Whoever thought that fat girl would grow into Oprah
Or that boy Rick Ross would be moldin' the culture
I push and push, we breakin' the mold
We push and we push, we rake in the hold

I push and I push, I ride and I ride
Tryna survive on 95 (Push it to the limit)
Put it all on the line every drop of a dime
I be pushin' them whips, yep, three at time
I'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)
I'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (Push it to the limit)

===== Rick Ross - Diced Pineapples =====
160 ContributorsDiced Pineapples Lyrics
Diced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but I'm, kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya, I'm tryin' to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking 'bout no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you, my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you what's better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or, temporary forevers
Shorty get it together, hah, diced pineapple
May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay 'til you need five and
Tell me shorty, you got it, baby
If it's not it, baby, hope it's progress, baby
Let it all drip, baby
Till you stop that shaking, no more talking, baby
No more talking, baby

Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, damn, my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib, I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh (ugh)
Sex all night, couple shots of CÎROC
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block
Money ain't a thing, baby, welcome to the mob
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad, got me wishing I could sing
Her uniform Isabel Marant, when you on the team
Double MG, them other niggas fell off
Baby girl, I just wanna see you well off

Call me crazy, shit, at least you're calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it, girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad, then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, I just bought my girl a set
I know my lifestyle wild, I do it for the set
She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex
Pop bottles, make love, Thug Passion
Red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion
Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated
Balmain, rich denim, out in Vegas
French Riviera, baby girl, let's take a trip
I'ma trip, go to Cannes, France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing
And with your permission, hopefully you'll learn a lesson (ugh)
I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk
She so fine, she ain't even gotta talk
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
She never wrote a song, but I know that she's a star

Call me crazy, shit, at least you're calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it, girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad, then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

Something about her, probably can't live without her
Roll up some sour, let me kiss on her fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won't ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your drawers, though patiently get you off
Hate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull
Like to go deep, but I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you? (sweet is you?) Let me see some proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don't need no room
Right now I'm trying to eat, and we don't need a spoon

Call me crazy, shit, at least you're calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it, girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad, then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

Ricky Ross, somethin' special right here
Excuse the marijuana, just tryina enjoy myself
We got some gangstas in the house too, come on

I gotta bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her (Boss)
Now she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right, he ain't actin' right
Every superwoman needs a superman, here I am

Sight seein', we might be in
The quattroporte or the new white BM
Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face
Next semester, she transfer to Florida State
Cookin' like Home EC for financial aid
I helped her out, she had problems with financial aid
Remember? Mean time our finance is straight
I even up the doors to the financial estates (Ross)
She use to fight with her mom
'Til I sat 'em both down, now she tight with her moms
Yeah, I put the ice on her arm
Now she know she gettin' sliced, spendin' nights in Milan
We still blow weed together
Cheated on her but we still gon' be together
Put the house on the water, hit the beach whenever
She from the north and still can't believe the weather

I gotta bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
Now she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right, he ain't actin' right
Every superwoman needs a superman, here I am

Here I am, here I go
Why you lookin' for the others when you got the best?
The previous was a test for ya, now ya in the big league
A black Steinbrenner, who wouldn't wanna play for me?
Ya last man was a chump and you can tell 'em I said it
He was talkin' loud at first but you can see that he didn't
You can see I ain't sweatin'
Hell I'll call him up myself and tell him how he can get it
Naw, please don't confuse me miss
I'm tryna see how I can put you on my Christmas list
I hope you ain't offended by this
But I think ya ass fine as shit
And that's straight up real talk, all bullshit aside
She replied, "I like to do the wild thing"
Actions took place, at my place
Now my place is her place

I gotta bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
Now she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right, he ain't actin' right
Every superwoman needs a superman, here I am

More better, more cheddar
Knocked ya man off the clothes line sweater
Hoe getter, gorilla
Fuck chauffeurs, I went and got more killas
I rock with niggas like Fabolous
Cause to tell the truth, life fabulous,
But you make it look glamorous
Cause them strapped heels aren't for amateurs
Wrist quite rocky, talk like Foxy
Job like Roxy, spark that broccoli
Walk like Aki, that means sexy
I will save you, if you let me
Fly with me, get high as me
A lot of alphabets girl I'm a G
Time will tell, Rolex watches
We show stoppers, hoes just watch us

I gotta bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
Now she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right, he ain't actin' right
Every superwoman needs a superman, here I am

I don't got a single sober vein in my body
I don't got a single sober vein in my body

Don't apologize, I quite enjoy messy
I see that bottle after bottle got you goin' crazy
And doin' shows after shows got me so lazy
So ride it out for me, and take it off for me
It's a good vibe, good vibe, good vibe
Don't you ever threaten niggas with a good time
She wanna buy a dream, I said I don't sell it
But she can rent it for a night, I don't mind, open wide
'Cause all this fame, I earned it, I might as well use it
Private elevator goin' straight to my unit
All my niggas 'round me, gettin' kickback pussy
All my killas 'round me, all be hiding in Stussy
Can't nobody stop me, used to be homeless (Used to be homeless)
Now that penthouse at the Ritz where my home is
Tour bus like a National Geographic
Bitches runnin' wild gettin' faded in the bathroom

It makes me smile, it makes me smile
'Cause I got it
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
'Cause I got it
All the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece
But now we got it
Man look at the kid now, can nobody stop me?
I don't got a single sober vein in my body

Fuck her like a thug nigga, young nigga, new Ferrari
Old money, I just 'fraid the Lord with us
Condo blow money, like it's all dope money
Come short wet niggas, like a speed boat coming, oh Lord
Mo money, mo money, these rich young niggas ain't ever know money
Belaire running down the Rollie on her arm (Arm)
Pinky ring six-hundred, what you know about it (What?)
I'm the champ, baby, Real Deal Holyfield (Huh)
Got the bitches, want it dirty, went and bought the crib
Twenty-five mil', I'm doing twenty-five-to-life
Hundred acres, keep my shooters all through the night
Every chandelier ran a nigga one mil'
Twenty chandeliers, motherfucker, who real (Uh)
I just wanna show her what I live like
Wearing a white Birkin on a winter night
Fuck a Birkin, now she in the Bentley
That's when she went and tatted double M G
Now our bond deep, deeper than the rap
She give me brain, she a mastermind to be exact
She a mastermind to be exact
I give her game and she give it back (Back)
Sip syrup so I fuck slow, sip more I wanna fuck more
Gotta grind 'till your eyes close
Stay strapped 'till the trap close
They scream Maybach on the cell blocks
All my dawgs who used to sell blocks
They say the niggas in the jail talk
How your homies commissary fell off
What make it worse he get an elbows
Twenty-five-to-life dead wrong on the cell phone

It makes me smile, it makes me smile
'Cause I got it
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
'Cause I got it
All the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece
But now we got it
Man look at the kid now, can nobody stop me?
I don't got a single sober vein in my body

She's just perfect in every kinda way
But I don't think I can handle her pain
So messed up and I'm too busy just runnin' my game
Oh, girl after girl, mistake after mistake

I tried to change, but they always around pullin' me down in bed (May-May)
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises (Uh)
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex (Uh)
I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit
Sorry won't turn back the clock
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh
But sorry don't make it right, I know (May-May-May)

We at the crib, she got her legs wrapped around my waist
Conversatin', she lick every tattoo that's on my face
Like a thug, I just wanna fuck, that's every day
Temporary separations, confessin' my mistakes
She packed her bags and left me home and I'm still hurt
You new pussy, but she can't tell me that it's real first
A lot of lies, apologize, the thirst real
When she hear this, thinkin' to herself, "Damn, this verse real"
Rehab out in Vegas, that made this a murdered sin
Sent the bottles to her table, then made love on the jet
Temporary thrills, all these women you think I tossed
My feelings genuine, disregard what you see on blogs
I been a boss before I recorded Meek song
Mill in cash on the 'Gram, they trendin' Meech home
In the D my G, he throwin' that P-Stone
Every picture that you post, leave comments on each one
I'm just a typical ordinary nigga
But I know that I can't change the rules
All this time I blamed you 'cause I know what I'm doing
Steppin' on your heart again, relationship ruined
I tried to change, but I'm always out, fuckin' around in the club (May-May)
Pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up (Uh)
My worst nightmare went right in my back, I wish I could wake up (Uh)
I feel like shit, know I ain't shit, but I'm (May-May-May)

Sorry won't turn back the clock
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh (Gotta love it, baby, uh)
But sorry don't make it right, I know (May-May-May)
Life's short and, baby girl, you deserve a winner
Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
Hustle from my heart, so every night I can deliver (Uh)
Sayin' sorry, layin' up, I'm way up in your liver (Boss)
Them red bottoms got you walkin' funny (Ha)
Get you a agent, she ballin' and all she talk is money (Right)
Take her shoppin', baby boy, ain't no salary caps (Uh)
She get it poppin', so you better bring battery packs (Huh)
Perfect time to relax
Nothin' is perfect other than me and the perfect match
They all watch me 'cause the moves I make out they budgets
Diamond district, six figures on my shorty nugget

I tried to change, but they always around, pullin' me down in bed (May-May-May)
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex (Yeah)
Yeah, I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit

Sorry won't turn back the clock (May-May)
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh
But sorry don't make it right (May-May-May)

I apologize
You're not perfect, I'm not perfect

My Rolls Royce triple-black, I'm Geechee, ho
Ballin' in the club, bottles like I'm Meechie, ho
Rozay—that's my nickname
Cocaine runnin' in my big veins
Self-made, you just affiliated
I build it ground-up, you bought it renovated
Talkin' plenty capers, nothing's been authenticated
Funny, you claimin' the same bitch that I'm penetrating
Hold the bottles up, where my comrades?
Where the fuckin' felons? Where my dogs at?
(Ugh!) I got that Archie Bunker
And it's so white, I just might charge you double

I think I'm Big Meech (Ugh), Larry Hoover
Whippin' work, hallelujah
One nation under God
Real niggas gettin' money from the fuckin' start
I think I'm Big Meech (Woo), Larry Hoover (Woo)

These motherfuckers mad that I'm icy! (Boss)
Stunt so hard, make them come indict me (Ugh)

It's an Audem-eer, hundred racks, at least
Look at yourself, now look at me (Me!)
You can't see a nigga, I'm what you used to be (Ha)
Look at it this way (Yeah), you niggas sideways (Sideways)
Always gettin' money, my nigga, crime pays (Crime pays)

Word to them thirty-six O's in a kilogram (Ha)
Blunt tip orange like caviar
Wildin' out, fishtailin', Subaru, rally car (Fishtailin')
Out the passenger, lettin' the automatic off (Let it off)
A eighth of that girl'll knock your mommy and your daddy off (You know that!)
Fuck around and knock the emblem on the Caddy off (Fuck around)
Four shooters buggin' out, blickin' at your Caddy doors (Blick-outs)
And did I mention: guns from Red Dead Redemption? (Did I?)
Nine-mils, fifty-clip extensions (A long clip)
Coke is like a mattress in the hood: I'm flippin' on it (I'm flippin')
And the money's like a chair: I'm sittin' on it (Keep quiet, nigga)

===== Rick Ross - So Sophisticated =====
75 ContributorsSo Sophisticated Lyrics
This shit is highly sophisticated
I just make it look easy, nigga
Follow me

I'm so sophisticated
To get a verse from me, you gotta be initiated
To get a purse from me, she gotta be sophisticated
Purchase a whip from me and never miss a single payment
I'm from the city where the Muslims even Christians hate it
Even the black folk hate to see another nigga made it
Tell all them pussies to chill, champagne refrigerated
Just bought a chopper 'cause the last one, got it confiscated
Counting a hundred mil so many times, I contemplate it
You wanna be the hottest but that shit get complicated
I pull your card, I know you're pussy by your conversation
Show you the safe, you'll have to kill me for that combination
Made another two milli just off the compilation
I just hit a lick, I'm telling you this shit amazing
Got a white bitch, she fucking me just like she Jamaican
Sipping purple and that motherfucker concentrated
This for my niggas in them prisons, overpopulated

This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mark, then you gotta make initial payment
We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation (Rugh!)
We so sophisticated (Ugh!)
Shit so sophisticated (Woo!)
Hundred millionaires, bitch we made it (Ugh!)

I'm so sophisticated
Smoking weed, busting open Dom and liquor later
I bust her open then I tell her I'ma lick her later
Pull out the stick and spray that bitch just like it’s activator
Time to lay down these niggas who still be masquerading
We know you pussies, so you got my niggas masturbating
Round of applause 'cause them choppers be so captivating
So sophisticated ‘cause them hits be calculated
Put yo dick in the dirt, now you decapitated
I'm getting money so you'll never hear me talking petty
Tatted on my stomach, rich forever, Makaveli (Babyyy)
Fifty million, hundred million, it's accumulating
I'm the hottest and these other niggas cooling, ain't it
I got a bitch I'm fucking that you see on BET
My Lil' Haiti shooters will have yo ass on TMZ
Breaking news and we still get them for ten a key
And if he faking, fuck him, tell them niggas "C'est la vie"

This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mark, then you gotta make initial payment
We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation (Rugh!)
We so sophisticated (Ugh!)
Shit so sophisticated (Woo!)
Hundred millionaires, bitch we made it (Ugh!)

Shitting on these haters, ball hard D Waiters
Ever since I got money, e'rybody need favors
That's why I ain't got no homies, and I ain't got no neighbors
But I be on my grind like I ain't got no paper
But I'm so rich and I got yo bitch
All in my whip and she all on my dick
With a hand on my stick, tryna live in my crib
'Cause I handle my shit like a candle got lit
'Cause I burn shit down, yeah I'm in my bag
And these niggas so mad it's my turn now
And I get that cash and my bitch so bad, she so sophisticated
I'm balling hard, fucking bitches and ain't got shit for haters
I hang my arm out the window now watch me get the paper
My neck so frosty, you frauding, yo shit refrigerator
Boy you an imitator
You ain’t got no M's in yo account, I never ask my amount
Treat that bad bitch like a bad check 'cause I cash that and I bounce
I ain't never had shit but I grab shit and I cashed out on that ounce
And I flipped that to a bird and bounced back like word

We so sophisticated
This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mark, then you gotta make initial payment
We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation (Rugh!)
We so sophisticated (Ugh!)
Shit so sophisticated (Woo!)
Hundred millionaires, bitch we made it (Ugh!)

There's a field with angels movin' around me
I just worship thee, for all he's done for me
It's a new day, I have been born again
I've been born again, I've been born again
In His spirit, and His name, I'm sanctified!
Lord I testify, he's right by my side
I believe it be, His word is so clear to me
Yeah, yeah
Okay, all I want's a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby, they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status
All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it had turned me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status

Niggas be lovin' the old Ye
They sayin' the new Ye, that nigga be spazzin'
But when Ali turn up and be Ali
You can't ever change that nigga back to Cassius
So you can gon' and make up lies, but I'm so sanctified
I don't sweat it, wipe my forehead with a handkerchief
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus (Hunt)
People sayin', "Ye, we need another Yeezus" (Hunt)
Lames try to tell me, "Cut the wildin' out, out"
But who the fuck is you reachin'?
Pass me 30 bottles, champagne procession
That's that Holy water, sanctified refreshments
God sent me a message, said I'm too aggressive
Really!? Me!? Too aggressive!?

I can feel his blessings wash away my sins
I'm sanctified and I have been born again
Now I proclaim, hallowed be thy name
Ohhh
Okay, all I want's a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby, they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status

Keys to my success, I get new keys and new address
Bitches that I date don't get degrees but they can dress
Fellatio's amazin', make grilled cheese for you the best
Major cult figure, I'm the fresh David Koresh
Soldiers all in gators, new Mercedes for cadets
Balmain uniform, you know Donda designed the vest
Double M, that be the Army, better yet, the Navy
Baby seen me in that Wraith, wanna have my baby
All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Now I want two hundred and ménage in my palace
Walkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' balance
Somewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice
Rims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I was childish
'Til I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was stylish
When we fucked again, she told me "That was just some foul shit"
I walk into the room, you can even hear all the silence

I can feel his blessings wash away my sins
I'm sanctified and, I have been born again
Now I proclaim, hallowed be thy name
Ohhh

This the flyest shit ever
This that Rich Forever part two
Uh, uh

Layin' in my bed, I'm under these gold chandeliers
Can't say too many names in here these kinda years
Nice sweaters and these icy diamonds on my wrist
Ice Cube lookin' nigga, you know life a bitch
I once got no allowance, now I got the crown
I said I was The Boss, nobody made a sound
Really had to see them things, this level story tellin'
Who else could flip a chorus into forty million?
Out in Cannes with Leonardo DiCaprio
While out on bond, pray I go to trial rapido
Eight felonies, tellin' me wanna give me life
Every nut I bust, really I gotta do it twice
Ricky Ronaldo, really when I'm in Portugal
I pull a yacht out, this weekend, I'm fuckin' so-and-so
Cameras flash, paparazzi layin' in the grass
Tom Brady my new neighbor, you can tell 'em that

(Ooh) Uh, I think she like me
Oh, I think she like me
I know her nigga don't like me
With your bitch right now, yeah, I might be (Ooh)
Sippin' this right now, yeah, we might be (Ooh, ooh)
Might hit her from the back, let her ride me (Ooh, ooh)
Girl, you'll never meet another nigga like me (Ooh, ooh)
Girl, you'll never meet another man like me

I'm sexin' women out on Fisher Isle
I gas her up and let her lick me down
I may name my daughter Hermes
Get Margiela to decorate the new birds nest
Twenty million up at Merrill Lynch
I met his chick, he haven't seen her since
Through the city, I'm still floatin' like a magic carpet
She stop me for a selfie, I just want the knowledge
Expressin' what you think'll send your kids to college
Or be a Geechi nigga just to keep the Bentley polished
Do it for the dear departed, fuck a Ben Carson
Empowering the youth made a nigga a target
Only one that's smokin' up in Goldman Sachs
But I'm the only one that's rollin' like a quarterback
And I never put it in my government
'Cause I never put on for the government

(Ooh) Uh, I think she like me
Oh, I think she like me
I know her nigga don't like me
With your bitch right now, yeah, I might be (Ooh)
Sippin' this right now, yeah, we might be (Ooh, ooh)

You caught the case, you gotta post the bond
I'm Rayful Edmonds mixed with young Wale Folarin (M-M-M)
Starin' in my safe, I'm rather safe than sorry
Diddy, Jigga only two niggas comin' for me (M-M-Maybach Music)
I park the Caddy in my livin' room
Pussy niggas lookin' for me, I'ma give it to 'em
Santorini, Greece, sex in the swimmin' pool
If her pussy dry, call her Beetlejuice
I'm baby-makin' in them Maldives
Put up all the yachts, pulled out the jetskis
Khaled hit me on the FaceTime (It's Billi!)
I'm the flyest nigga on his bassline
She see the sneakers and she see the stones
Fat boy run the city, seated in the throne
I'm cashin' in like the Kardashians
My paralyzed homie snuck the ratchet in

Cause real bosses don't go to jail, you feel what I'm sayin'?
So yeah that's what I want y'all to know, you know what I mean?
As far as like his thinkin' patterns you know what I mean?
You know I admire y'all
The way y'all think, you know what I'm sayin'?
And I also admire that I was apart of that foundation from day one
You know? Y'all was the good homies
Y'all took the baton and ran with it
The thing is that I was workin' towards was
The empire is what I was workin' towards
And y'all took the baton and ran with it so it's nothin' but love man
Anythin' y'all need me to do from behind these walls, I'mma do it
You know what I'm sayin', without no question

The pot boils, temp rises, a hot boy
It's the fat boy, skinny ties, don't empty mine nigga
Tall ceilings, chandeliers, I'm authentic
Gettin' long money, short winded, let's go and get it nigga
Bang bang, bitch niggas caught drinkin' chase
Roll that double M, get shot and your finger waves
Twenty chicken spots and I still be movin' that base
Gave a job to the children you scared to raise
Chain swangin', name rangin'
Shots fired, same nigga
We movin' weight, I'm at a different pace
I'm out in Haïti with my lady screamin' "n'ap boule"
I'm hard to kill, Dade County, Versace Neil
Fourteen for that tattoo, worth that dollar bill
Only one man got the combination to the safe
Grammy nominated once, but I’m still movin' base

You see them plaques on a nigga wall
And we movin' bass
Got them records jumpin' off the store uhh
And we movin' bass
Copper tried to knock us off
And we movin' bass
Haters throwin' shots through a niggas door
And we still movin' bass
Yeah

Fallin' from the sky, the money bad the bigger
Angels tatted all on me, pray for a Lord and sinner
Rolls Royce Corniche, sweepin' me off my feet
New bitches they by the fleet and we do em' all by the week
Taz Angels just wanna chill, jewelers just wanna meet
Weed man expensive, three trips a week
Misses just wanna freak, feds stay up the street
Know they tailin' us close so we leak what we wanna leak
New mob, suit sharp, my suit Farrahkhan
In the house of the lord, my niggas bearin' arms
His eyes wide, nose runny got what he fiendin' for
I'm movin' base, we outta state you know my speakers low
Put the pistol to your mouth now show me to the safe
Grammy nominated once, but I'm still movin' bass

You see them plaques on a nigga wall
We still movin' bass
Got them records jumpin' off the store uh
And we still movin' bass
Copper tried to knock us off
And we still movin' bass
Haters throwin' shots through a niggas door
And we still movin' bass

You see the plaques on the wall but the yayo still in the spot
See my cousin off to college, I see that it costs a lot
Tallons fillin' the jammy, Miami still in my heart
Niggas playin' the corner, guess their playin' their part
Early coppin' the coupes, ladies stay on our feet
Your brother went to duplex, smell the dope from across the street
Hoodies come in all flavors, all black if you think you sweet
Arabs sellin' grenades by the box, you'll get it cheap
Schoolin' the little niggas, kilos all in the campus
A passport is necessary visa with all the rubbers
I beef with all the red cappers, head to the shop for some tobacco
(Blocka, blocka, blocka, blocka, blocka!)
BR-80 just a plus, don't mention the dust

You see them plaques on a nigga wall
We still movin' bass
Got them records jumpin' off the store
And we still movin' bass
Copper tried to knock us off
And we still movin' bass
Haters throwin' shots through a niggas door
And we still movin' bass

Never trust a bitch who finds love in a camera
She will fuck you, then turn around and fuck a janitor
Set the parameters
You either with the pro ballers or the amateurs
I won't let you ruin my dreams or Harvey Weinstein the kid
Good mornin', Matt Lauer—can I live?
Look at my new digs
The rooftop can host a paint-and-sip for, like, forty
The Warhols on my wall paint a war story
Had to find other ways to invest
'Cause you rappers found every way to ruin Pateks
It's a nightmare, yeah
I'm too rare amongst all of this pink hair, ooh!
Still do the Fred Astaire on a brick
Tap-tap, throw the phone if you hear it click
Art Basel-in' the bezel
Your bustdown is bust-down and don't match the metal
Lower level's where you settle at
I'm the pot callin' the kettle black
Where there's no brake pedals at
Between God and where the Devil's at
Had to double-dutch and double back
Then hopscotch through where the trouble's at
Exactly what the game's been missin'
This fire burns hot as Hell's Kitchen
Push!

Now that's how the ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
That's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo
Now that's how the ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
This for the sneaker hoarders and coke snorters
'Cause that's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo
From Honda Accords to Grammy awards, yo
That's where the kings go

I can blow a million dollars into dust
Lord knows how many bottles I've done bust
Still runnin' through the models like I'm Puff (M-M-M—)
Confront my problems like I'm Ralo in the bluff
Pusha know these politics is paradox
Chillin' in a condo full of ready-rock
My homie amputated but gon' stand for somethin'
I'm dyin' to find a way to get a Grammy from it (Maybach Music)
Watchin' my success, for some, is bittersweet
Always keep the sharpshooters' triggers tweaked
Diamonds drippin' on me via Tiffany's
All these K-9 units still sniffin' me
Ignorance versus the innocence
It's not the temperature for you in Timberlands
I keep the coldest flows on the hot seat (M-M-M—)
And you can spot my hoes by they car keys
Another episode full of atrocities
It's double-M, baby, money monopolies (Maybach Music)
You scared to see my face in a fancy place
So why debate my case vs. a Nancy Grace?
It's flesh and blood 'til I'm fresh as fuck
Still hands-on, sucker, press your luck (M-M—)
Your money gone every other month
My money long, so the treasure's tucked

Now that's how the ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo

Hopped out the Magnum, hopped in the Tre'

===== Rick Ross - Thug Cry =====
100 ContributorsThug Cry Lyrics
J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

I just wanna be the one, I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down
I just wanna, I just wanna fly, I'ma show you tonight
That I'ma put it on you baby, take you past the sky

Uh, wake up in the world and I'm just another nigga
Call it public housin' when you next door to the killers
On them corners, it gets better as you go
Grind that motherfucker 'til it's yellow brick road
Free as a bird, spoken word in my verse
On my knees prayin', niggas shootin' in the church
Wake up out my sleep in another cold sweat
I lived on Billboard, where the fuck to go next?
Go against the odds youngin', go and get a job
Another country boy they want back on the farm
So far from my goals but I'm close to my kids
Thug cry for Mac Dre, nigga, throwin' up Thizz

I just wanna be the one, I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down
I just wanna, I just wanna fly, I'ma show you tonight
That I'ma put it on you baby, take you past the sky
I just wanna burn

Uhh, well let me light one for my problems
Smokin' on that loud, pumpin' up that volume
Get it crackin' like an eggshell in this motherfucker, make omelettes
Get a bad bitch that posts up like comments
They don't know what I been through
Don't know what I'm goin' through
As long as I get through, that's what I look forward to
Richer than a bitch, but still I can't afford to
Let these niggas play with me, need to be remorseful
I swear I got that silencer on that MAC-9
Yeah, I kill these niggas with silence
My head stay in the clouds, I really feel like a giant
Can't trust none of these niggas, I murk one of these niggas
Then bury one of these niggas, still got dirt under my fingers
That ain't a threat, that's a bet
'Cause they comin' at my neck like the best a man can get
But to make a long story short, I need a shoulder
'Cause the devil on one, the other one, I'm lookin' over
Tunechi

I just wanna be the one, I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down
I just wanna, I just wanna fly, I'ma show you tonight
That I'ma put it on you baby, take you past the sky
I just wanna burn

Uh, I pray I live forever
Niggas hatin' like it's Salt Lake City
No tints on that pretty ass Bentley
Want you to know that them comments don't offend me
'Cause your baby momma so friendly
I proceed with the plan, weed in my hand
Cîroc in my cup, quick pic for a fan
Money over bitches, first nigga with a Wraith
Double M, we handle business 'cause them niggas getting raped
Go get the yellow tape, it's well orchestrated
200 acres estates, a young nigga made it
Came from the hood, ain't nothing changed
Still lemon pepper on my motherfuckin' wings!

I just wanna be the one, I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down
I just wanna, I just wanna fly, I'ma show you tonight
That I'ma put it on you baby, take you past the sky
I just wanna burn

Huh! Mastermind
As I get high in the middle of the night
Sometimes I ask myself, do thugs cry?
Uhh, uhh, Mastermind, my 6th LP
Can't believe we did it
Man, I thank everybody that played a part of this
Shout out my engineer E-Mix
Each and every one of you supporters
My fans, 100

===== Rick Ross - Apple of my eye =====
63 ContributorsApple of My Eye Lyrics
(Hahahah!)
Just being somebody that the neighborhood respected
And my mama could be proud of, was the apple of my eye
That's all I ever wanted, just being something, man
So at that point what else can you ask for?
(M-M-Maybach Music)

Tears runnin' down a nigga face
In a room full of failures, I feel out of place
Still sleepin' on the floor when you deserve better
Got you reekin' through the cold even in warm weather
I told Meek, "I wouldn't trust Nicki
Instead of beefin' with your dog, you just give 'em some distance"
We all make mistakes, let's not be too specific
We like, "I rather be a killer than be a statistic"
I never fold, no, I never ran
On my soul, I'll roll like an avalanche
I thank the Lord I got some great friends
That's why every bottle I open, I say, "Amen"
Just had seizure at the Super Bowl
Woke up in the third quarter lookin' for the smoke
If it's more than a quarter million, I'll count it twice
Pucci broke my heart, shit, I call it life
And never will I call it right
Not perfect but I'm the one you would call at night
Travelin' the world, I'm just reppin' my city
But rarely do I hear that this nigga done did it
When niggas in fatigues will keep you intrigued
'Cause the loss of life's the only thing niggas believe
So I pray you listen carefully
Then I become another motherfuckin' casualty

Always speak and say hi
You just never ever walk on by (never ever walk on by)
You even stopped and put one in the sky (the sky)
You do it for the love of you and I (for the love of you and)

Standin' on your block but you so out of place
Uncle on the couch, momma runnin' out of space
Lights off so you never tend to speak much
Go your separate ways every time the lease up
A fat ugly nigga, thought I'd never be nothin'
Another tree stump, happy with his free lunch
Duckin' pigeons, I'm an eagle on a sunny day
Flap my wings once a week, pray I glide safe
I want fried chicken at my funeral
Rolls Royces, dope boys, Sway interviews
Everybody dyin' for the same things
Cop kill a nigga, don't nobody gangbang
I'm happy Donald Trump became the president
Because we gotta destroy, before we elevate
Real shit, look at me inside the white house
With a pocket full of weed inside the white house
Dead presidents tattooed on a nigga chest
U.S. treasury addressing me, mad at my address
Own the biggest residential pool in the U.S
Drake and Kanye can invite every bitch they ever met
Finger fuckin' bitches in the holy water
Then I go an tell what happened to my only daughter
So her daddy told it to her firsthand
Never perfect but it's not just 'bout them purses

Always speak and say hi
You just never ever walk on by (never ever walk on by)
You even stopped and put one in the sky (the sky)
You do it for the love of you and I (for the love of you and)
Maybach Music

The streets could never teach me
All the things I got from you
I found myself in the wrong lane
And I ended up in pain, pain
I was strolling down a dark street
When this girl passed me by
She said you've always been a good friend (always been a good friend)
And you never never never let me down
I'll just fall back, never turn back
Let it go, let it go
I'll just fall back, never turn back
Let it go, let it go

Always speak and say hi
You just never ever walk on by (never ever walk on by)
You even stopped and put one in the sky (the sky)
You do it for the love of you and I (for the love of you and)

67 ContributorsWalk This Way Lyrics
Now there's a backseat lover that's always undercover
And I talk 'til my daddy say
Said, "You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin"
"And there's sure to be a change in ways"
Now, there's a cheerleader that's a real big bleeder
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing of loving was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this

See-saw swinging with the boys in school
And her feet was flying up in the air
Singing, "Hey diddle diddle with the kitty in the middle"
And they swinging like it just don't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin' 'cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to

Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to)
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Well, just gimme a kiss
Ooh, like this

School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt hanging way up her knee
It was three young ladies in the school gym locker
And they found they were looking at D
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me something I missed
That my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
And I gave the girl a little kiss, like this

See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing, "Hey diddle diddle, with your kitty in the middle"
I was swinging like I didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin' when she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to

Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to)

This speech is my recital, I think it's very vital
To rock a rhyme that's right on time, "It's Tricky" is the title (Here we go)

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tr-tr-tr-tricky, tricky, tricky

I met this little girlie, her hair was kind of curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is, "Please me"
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said, "It's not that easy"

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky (How is it D?)
It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tricky, tricky, tricky

In New York, the people talk and try to make us rhyme
They really hawk, but we just walk because we have no time
And in the city, it's a pity 'cause we just can't hide
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky (How is it D?)
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky, huh

When I wake up, people take up mostly all of my time
I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' 'cause I make up a rhyme
I'm not braggin', people naggin' 'cause they think I'm a star
Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far
A girl named Carol follows Darryl every gig we play
Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay
I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' 'cause I'm on TV
They even bother my poor father 'cause he's down with me

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky (How is it?)
Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time, it's tricky

We are not thugs, we don't use drugs, but you assume on your own
They offer coke and lots of dope, but we just leave it alone
It's like that, y'all, y'all, but we don't quit
You keep on rock shock 'cause this is it

Unemployment at a record high
People coming, people going, people born to die
Don't ask me because I don't know why
But it's like that and that's the way it is

People in the world tryin' to make ends meet
You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet
I said, you got to work hard, you want to compete
It's like that and that's the way it is
Huh

Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes?
It's like that and that's the way it is

Bills rise higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh

Wars going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity?
It's like that and that's the way it is

Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh

You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You noticed one time he was your man
It's like that (What?) and that's the way it is

You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that (What?) and that's the way it is
Huh

One thing I know is that life is short
So listen up, homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching, why don't you get taught?
It's like that (What?) and that's the way it is

If you really think about it, times aren't that bad
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad
Stop playing, start praying, you won't be sad
It's like that (What?) and that's the way it is
Huh

When you feel you fail, sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church
It's like that and that's the way it is

Here's another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool who's prejudiced
Because we're all written down on the same list
It's like that (What?) and that's the way it is
Huh

You know it's like that and that's the way it is
Because it's like that and that's the way it is
You know it's like that and that's the way it is
Because it's like that and that's the way it is
You know it's like that and that's the way it is
Because it's like that and that's the way it is
You know it's like that and that's the way it is

Looked at his dog, oh my God, an ill reindeer
But then I was illin' 'cause the man had a beard
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared
So I turned my head a second and the man was gone
But he must've dropped his wallet smack dead on the lawn
I picked the wallet up, but then I took a pause
Took out the license and it cold said, "Santa Claus"
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease
But I'd never steal from Santa 'cause that ain't right
So I was going home to mail it back to him that night
But when I got home, I bugged 'cause under the tree
Was a letter from Santa and the dough was for me

It's Christmastime in Hollis, Queens
Mom's cookin' chicken and collard greens
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees
Decorate the house with lights at night
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright
In the fireplace is the yule log
Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's
But each and every year, we bust Christmas carols


Rhymes so loud and proud, you hear it
It's Christmastime and we got the spirit
Jack Frost chillin', the orchids out
And that's what Christmas is all about
The time is now, the place is here
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer

My name's D.M.C. with the mic in my hand
And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman
So open your eyes, lend us an ear
We wanna say, Merry Christmas and happy New Year

===== Run–D.M.C. - It's Like That =====
53 ContributorsIt’s Like That Lyrics
Unemployment at a record high
People coming, people going, people born to die
Don't ask me because I don't know why
But it's like that and that's the way it is

People in the world tryin' to make ends meet
You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet
I said, you got to work hard, you want to compete
It's like that and that's the way it is
Huh

Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes?
It's like that and that's the way it is

Bills rise higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh

Wars going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity?
It's like that and that's the way it is

Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh

You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You noticed one time he was your man
It's like that (What?) and that's the way it is

You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that (What?) and that's the way it is
Huh

One thing I know is that life is short
So listen up, homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching, why don't you get taught?
It's like that (What?) and that's the way it is

If you really think about it, times aren't that bad
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad
Stop playing, start praying, you won't be sad
It's like that (What?) and that's the way it is
Huh

When you feel you fail, sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church
It's like that and that's the way it is

Here's another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool who's prejudiced
Because we're all written down on the same list
It's like that (What?) and that's the way it is
Huh

You know it's like that and that's the way it is
Because it's like that and that's the way it is
You know it's like that and that's the way it is
Because it's like that and that's the way it is
You know it's like that and that's the way it is
Because it's like that and that's the way it is
You know it's like that and that's the way it is
Because it's like that and that's the way it is

69 ContributorsPeter Piper Lyrics
Now Peter Piper picked peppers, but Run rocked rhymes
Humpty Dumpty fell down, that's his hard time
Jack B. Nimble was nimble and he was quick
But Jam Master cut faster, Jack's on Jay's dick
Now Little Bo Peep cold lost her sheep
And Rip Van Winkle fell the hell asleep
And Alice chilling somewhere in Wonderland
Jack's serving Jill a bucket in his hand
And Jam Master Jay's making all that sound
The turntables might wobble, but they don't fall down

Now Dr. Seuss and Mother Goose both did their thing
But Jam Master's getting loose and D.M.C.'s the king
'Cause he's adult entertainer, child educator
Jam Master Jay king of the crossfader
He's the better of the best, best believe he's the baddest
Perfect timing when I'm climbing, I'm a rhyming apparatus
Lot of guts, when he cuts, girls move their butts
His name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts
And on the mix real quick and I'd like to say
He's not Flash, but he's fast and his name is Jay

It, it goes a one, two, three, and

Jay's like King Midas as I was told
Everything that he touch turn to gold
He's the greatest of the greater, get it straight, he's great
Playing fame 'cause his name is known in every state
His name is Jay, to see him play, will make you say
"God damn that DJ made my day"
Like the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker
He's a maker, a breaker, and a title taker
Like the little old lady who lived in a shoe
If cuts were kids he would be due
Not lying y'all, he's the best I know
And if I lie my nose will grow
Like a little wooden boy named Pinocchio
And you all know how the story go

Tricks are for kids, he plays much gigs
He's a big bad wolf and you're the three pigs
He's a big bad wolf in your neighborhood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good

There it is

We're Run-D.M.C., got a beef to settle
D's not Hansel, he's not Gretel
Jay's a winner, not a beginner
His pocket gets fat, others get thinner
J-j-j-j-j, jump on Jay like cow jumps moon
People chase Jay like dish and spoon
And like all fairy tales end
You'll see Jay again my friend, huh

===== Run–D.M.C. - My Adidas =====
58 ContributorsMy Adidas Lyrics
My Adidas walk through concert doors
And roam all over coliseum floors
I stepped on stage, at Live Aid
All the people gave, and the poor got paid
And out of speakers I did speak
I wore my sneakers but I'm not a sneak
My Adidas touch the sand of a foreign land
With mic in hand, I cold took command
My Adidas and me close as can be
We make a mean team, my Adidas and me
We get around together, we're down forever
And we won't be mad when caught in bad weather
My Adidas
(Uh)
My Adidas
(Uh)
Yo, what's up?

My Adidas, standin' on two fifth street
Funky fresh and yes, cold on my feet
With no shoestring in 'em, I did not win 'em
I bought 'em off the ave' with the black Lee denim
I like to sport 'em, that's why I brought 'em
A sucker tried to steal 'em so I caught 'em and I fought 'em
And I walk down the street, and bop to the beat
With Lee on my legs and Adidas on my feet
And so now I'm just standin' here shootin' the gip
Me and D and my Adidas standing on two fifth
My Adidas
My Adidas

Now me and my Adidas do the illest things
We like to stomp out pimps with diamond rings
We slay all suckers who perpetrate
And lay down law from state to state
We travel on gravel, dirt road or street
I wear my Adidas when I rock the beat
On stage front page, every show I go
It's Adidas on my feet, high top or low
My Adidas
My Adidas

What up, what up, what up?

Now the Adidas I possess for one man is rare
Myself, homeboy got fifty pair
Got blue and black, 'cause I likes to chill
And yellow and green when it's time to get ill
Got a pair that I wear when I'm playin' ball
With the heel inside, make me ten feet tall

My Adidas only bring good news
And they are not used as felon shoes
They're black and white, white with black stripes
The ones I like to wear when I rock the mic
On the strength of a famous university
We took the beat from the street and put it on TV
My Adidas are seen on the movie screen
Hollywood knows we're good, if you know what I mean
We started in the alley, now we chill in Cali
And I won't trade my Adidas for no  beat up Bally's
My Adidas

48 ContributorsDown With the King Lyrics
Reporters clock, producers jock
They wanna be down with the King!

Down with the king for years, about ten of 'em
Recruiting suckers mackin' mic, and makin' men of 'em
Tears and fears for my peers, they rippin'
You think that it is, it is, if not it isn't
Race for the border my daughter, 'cause beats you're bangin' out
Jeeps rockin' beats in the streets when there's time for hangin' out
Gather, or rather form a circle around a loud
'Cause brothers or others could never ever rock a crowd
Is it because he's runnin' off with the mouth
Or was he really clearly tryin' to play a nigga out
Nope, shut him down, the king with a crown
'Cause all you wanna be is Diggy Down

Down with the king
The king down with the king 
The king

Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was meeca, and it went this way
Recollect a mecca mic check on the windmill skills
Mac distracts, wearing Godfather hats
It's okay to parlay to forte better
Tell 'em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather
Swing another Rodney King thing and I'll wreck
But just like the white one I get no respect
Money stay awake, 'cause them other niggas are fake
From Hollis to the Beacon, now your dumb ass is leakin'
CL and Run D.M.C. so rush it
Big time weight before Hammer got to touch it
Remember the faces in all types of places
Look Ma, no shoelaces
And I'm

Down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King

I'm takin' the tours, I'm wreckin' the land
I keep it hardcore because it's dope man
These are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down
Not meant for a ho like a slow jam, check it
Sucka emcees could never swing with D
Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only G-O-D could be a king to me
And if the G-O-D be in me, then the king I be
The microphone is branded when it's handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree
That I rock all the world and the society
Outrageous on the stages with a tune of verse
I give praises from these pages to the universe
My voice is raw, my lyrics is law
I keep it hardcore like you never saw

Down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King

I'm the man you see, in the place to be
I went to John Jay University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after twelve grade I went straight to college
Down with the kings on the mic, a full swinger
The P to the R, not an R&B singer
The R to the U-N-D-MC'n
The fly human beings, tonight I hold the key and
Flowin' with the funk track, here to soul brother black
Pick up the bass, better yet leave a space
So let me put my big black twinkie on in to the early mornin'
Had skins yawning'
Mecca? (yo) you want the mecca? (yo)
I'll make a funky beat so we can blow, check it out
Pete Rock's the beat knock, put you in a headlock
And now all the outty out flock is down with the king

Down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King

Down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King Down with the

===== Run–D.M.C. - King of Rock =====
61 ContributorsKing of Rock Lyrics
I'm the king of rock, there is none higher
Sucker MCs should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' 'til I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us but give us respect
They called us hip, we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devastating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten-foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul
Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a verbal treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?

Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll, I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school
You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees won't bend
Music ain't nothin' but a people's jam
It's DJ Run, DMC, rockin' without a band
Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MCs, you gotta say please
'Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down ree's
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-D.M.C.'s?
I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, hey
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be meek
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
'Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say shall set a trend
Because a devastating rap is what we send

Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, "DMC, what does it mean?"
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean
Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch, I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack  to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MCs, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool, cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin' hard times, for sucker MC's
'Cause they don't make no songs like these
Period

===== Run–D.M.C. - Rock Box =====
62 ContributorsRock Box Lyrics
Run-D.M.C
Live for you, fresh


For all you sucker MCs perpetratin' a fraud
Your rhymes are cold wack and keep the crowd cold bored
You're the kind of guy that girl ignored
I'm drivin' a Caddy, you fixin' a Ford
My name is Joseph Simmons, but my middle name's Ward
And when I'm rockin' on the mic, you should all applaud
Because we're wheelin', dealin', we got a funny feelin'
We rock from the floor up to the ceilin'
We groove it, you move it, it has been proven
We calm the savage beast because our music is soothin'
We create it, relate it, and often demonstrate it
We'll diss a sucker MC, make the other suckers hate it
We're risin', suprisin', and often hypnotizin'
We always tell the truth and then we never slip no lies in
No curls, no braids peasy-head and still get paid
Jam Master cut the record up and down and cross-fades


Because the rhymes I say sharp as a nail
Witty as can be and not for sale
Always funky fresh, could never be stale
Took a test to become an MC and didn't fail
I couldn't wait to demonstrate
All the super def rhymes that I create
I'm a wizard of a word, that's what you heard
And anything else is quite absurd
I'm the master of a mic, that's what I say
And if I didn't say that, you'd say it any way
Bust into the party, come in the place
See the first things come, the music in your face
Girls on the walls, some on the floor
With the DJ named Jay with the cuts galore
So listen to this because it can't be missed
And you can't leave 'til you're dismissed
You can do anything that you want to
But you can't leave until we're through
So relax your body and your mind
And listen to us say this rhyme, hey
You might think that you have waited
Long enough 'til the rhyme was stated
But if it were a test it would be graded
With a grade that's not debated
Nothing too deep and nothing dense
And all our rhymes make a lot of sense
So move your butt to the cut
Run amok, you're not in a rut
Each and everybody out there, we got the notion
We want to see y'all all in motion
Just shake, wiggle, jump up and down
Move your body to the funky sound
Side to side, back and forth
We're the two MCs and we're gonna go off
Stand in place, walk or run
Tap your feet, you'll be on the one
Just snap your fingers and clap your hands
Our DJ's better than all these bands
Huh

We got all the lines and all the rhymes
We don't drop dimes and we don't do crimes
We bake a little cake with Duncan Hines
And never wear the pants they call the Calvin Kleins
'Cause Calvin Klein's no friend of mine
Don't want nobody's name on my behind
Lee on my legs, sneakers on my feet
D by my side and Jay with the beat (Beat)

Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay, uh, uh
We don't stop
Don't, don't stop (Jay)
One, one, two, two, three, three
The, the Hollis, Hollis crew, crew
For, for, for, for, for the love now
Cool T now, hah, hah
My man, my man
My, my man Jam Master
In, in his place to be (Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay)
The big beat blaster
Wailin', straight up rap
Countin' green
All the way live
Re-Remember you don't stop
And, and, and, and you don't stop
R-R-Rock, rock the spot
Stick 'em and you don't stop, hah (Stick 'em)
Run rocks it well, huh, well, well
A-with the clientele
Krush Groove (Young ladies in the place)
We're-We're, we're-we're (Bass)
We're-we're, we're-we're in the hottest place

Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was def, a-then it went this way
Took a test to become an MC
And Orange Krush became amazed at me
So Larry put me inside his Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back
Dave cut the record down to the bone
And now they got me rockin' on the microphone
And then we talkin' autograph and cheers and laugh
Champagne caviar, and bubble bath
But see, ah, ah, that's the life, ah, that I lead
And you sucker MCs is who I please
So take that and move back, catch a heart attack
Because there's nothin' in the world that Run'll ever lack
I cold chill at a party in a B-boy stance
And rock on the mic and make the girls wanna dance
Fly like a dove that come from up above
I'm rockin' on the mic and you can call me Run-Love

I got a big long Caddy, not like a Seville
And written right on the side, it reads, "Dressed to Kill"
So if you see me cruisin', girls, just a-move or step aside
There ain't enough room to fit you all in my ride
It's on a, a first come, first serve basis
Coolin' out, girl, take you to the def places
One of a kind and for your people's delight
And for you sucker MC, you just ain't right
Because you're bitin' all your life, you're cheatin' on your wife
You're walkin' 'round town like a hoodlum with a knife
You're hangin' on the ave, chillin' with the crew
And everybody know what you've been through

A-with the one, two, three, three to two, one
My man Larry Larr, my name's DJ Run
We do it in the place with the highs and the bass
I'm rockin' to the rhythm, won't you watch it on my face?
Go uptown and come down to the ground
You sucker MCs, you sad-faced clown
You a five-dollar boy and I'm a-million dollar man
You's a sucker MC and you're my fan
You try to bite lines, but rhymes are mine
You's a sucker MC in a pair of Calvin Kleins
Comin' from the wackest part of town
Tryin' to rap up, but you can't get down
You don't even know your English, your verb, or noun
You're just a sucker MC, you sad-faced clown
So DMC, and if you're ready
The people rockin' steady
You're drivin' big cars, get your gas from Getty

I'm DMC in the place to be
I go to St. John's University
And since kindergarten, I acquired the knowledge
And after 12th grade, I went straight to college
I'm light-skinned, I live in Queens
And I love eatin' chicken and collard greens
I dress to kill, I love the style
I'm an MC, you know, who's versatile
Say I got good credit in your regards
Got my name, not numbers on my credit cards
I go uptown, I come back home
With who? Me, myself, and my microphone
All my rhymes are sweet delight
So here's another one for y'all to bite
When I rhyme, I never quit
And if I got a new rhyme, I'll just say it
'Cause it takes a lot to entertain
And sucker MCs can be a pain
You can't rock a party with the hip in hop
You gotta let 'em know you'll never stop
The rhymes have to make a lot of sense
You got to know where to start when the beats commence

One day when I was chillin' in Kentucky Fried Chicken
Just mindin' my business, eatin' food and finger lickin'
This dude walked in lookin' strange and kind of funny
Went up to the front with a menu and his money
He didn't walk straight, kind of side-to-side
He asked this old lady, "Yo, yo, um, is this Kentucky Fried?"
The lady said "Yeah", smiled and he smiled back
He gave a quarter and his order, small fry and Big Mac

You be illin' (Yo, yo, what you tell that kid?), illin'
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin'

To-day you won a ticket to see Doctor J
Front row seat (In free), no pay
Radio in hand, snacks by feet
Game's about to start, you kickin' popcorn to the beat
You finally wake up, Doc's gone to town
Round his back, through the hoop, then you scream, "Touchdown!"

You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin' (Run, what you tell that kid?)
You be illin', illin'

The other day around the way I seen you illin' at a party
Drunk as a skunk, you illin', punk, and in your left hand was Bacardi
You went up to this fly girl and said "Yo, yo, can I get this dance?"
She smelled your breath and then she left you standin' in your illin' stance

You be illin', illin' (You know what your problem is?)
You be illin', illin' (Yo, Run, what you tell that kid?)
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin'

For dinner, you ate it, there is none left
It was salty, with butter and it was def
You proceeded to eat it 'cause you was in the mood
But, holmes, you did not read it was a can of dog food

You be illin', illin' (Uh, illin'? I be chillin')
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin' (Yo, what he doin'?)
You be illin'
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin' (You, you, you, you)
You be illin', illin' (You, you, you, you, you, you, you)
You be illin', illin' (Yo, yo)
You be illin', ill-illin' (Yo, homeboy)
You be illin', illin' (Who, me?)
You be illin', illin', ill-ill-illin'
You be illin', ill-ill-ill-ill-illin'

Yo, I know you ain't talkin' to me (Illin')
Man, you ain't sayin' nothin' (Illin')
Ill-illin' (Man, why don't you drop this beat?)
Talkin' 'bout my moms? Talkin' 'bout my moms?

“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’

Had a fly girl Flo, called her honey
Next thing she spent up all my money
Had me in debt, you and your girl’s dizzy
Stopped movin’ crack, but you’re still gettin’ pissy
You could call me everyday God sent
Like you was Lois Lane and I was Clark Kent
I spend and I spend and you spent and you spent
Now my house with a mouse is a roach with a tent

“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’

Mary-Mary-Mary, you cold thumb suckin’
Lookin’ for you, but you keep duckin’
I wanna find you, I gotta tell you somethin’
So just be quiet and don’t say (Nuttin’)
Mary-Mary-Mary, why you out there stuntin’?
Supposed to be with me, but not you’re frontin’
We started out new, you used to be true
Now you’re buggin’, what’s wrong with you?

“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’

Now! This girl Mary I knew so well
I met her on the road in a fly hotel
High on the heels and never failed
(Clubs and the pubs is where she dwelled)
Story about Mary was well to tell
She seemed to scheme for a dream to sell
She spent a night locked in a cell
I knew Mary well cause she “Raising Hell”

“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’

It’s not Mary who was quite contrary
Talkin’ bout Mary who was always in a hurry
The things she needed were necessary
She did not need a busted cherry
True and blue just like a blueberry
Ask if she’s crazy and I’ll say very
Livin’ in a house that’s out on the prairie
I worry about Mary, cause Mary is scary

“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’
“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’
“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?

We have (“Say what?”) a whole lot of superstars on this stage here tonight, but I want y’all to know one thing, this is my house. And when I say who’s house, y’all know what time it is

Whose house? (“Say what?”)
Run’s house

Ah, once again my friend, not a trend for then
They said, rap was crap, but never had this band
Till the ruler came with a cooler name
Made ya dance and prance and drove the fans insane
Name is Run my son, number one for fun
Not a gun, that’s done, and get done by none
The other act, in fact, ya just wack I kill (Why?)
It’s fun, my son, and Run heads the bill

Whose house? (“Say what?”)
Run’s house (“Say what?”)
Whose house? (“Say what?”)
Run’s house (“Say what?”)

I’m in the house y’all
I’m in the house y’all
And this is how D.M.C. will turn it out y’all
I’m in the house y’all
I’m in the house y’all
And this is what D.M.C. be about y’all

Well my name is DMC, the all-time great (great)
I bust the most rhymes in New York state (state)
Reporters clock (clock), producers jock (jock)
They want to be down with the ki-i-ing
The wanted man (man) from the wanted clan (clan)
Wanted by every fan (fan) across the land (land)
Not a G.A.N.G. off the street (street)
(R-U-N-D-M-C complete!)

Whose house? (“Say what?”)
Run’s house (“Say what?”)
Whose house? (“Say what?”)
Run’s house (“Say what?”)

“Run—Run—Run-Run-Run—Run”
“Run—Run—Run-Run-Run”

Get on the mic and (MC)

Another time I take for the rhyme I make
Make me mad and sad, because the fad is fake
See I do this thing, so come pursue this king
One minor rhyme is all you just bring
Cause I’m the best I’m def, ask the rest they left
That’s my name, my game, and we don’t need the ref
So get the booze you lose and suckas close your mouth
I set a trap for rap thats crap, it’s Run’s house

Whose house? (“Say what?”)
Run’s house (“Say what?”)
Whose house? (“Say what?”)
Run’s house (“Say what?”)

Some underestimate and miscalculate
My intent to create what I call the great
Till I make a song (song) that I prove ‘em wrong (wrong)
See my song so strong it’ll make em come along (long)
Come in the door (door), get on the floor (floor)
Hard rock hard hitting hip hop hardcore (core)
Causing casualties and catastrophes
And tragedies for the suck emcees
Using strategies to get the best of me
You dirty rat emcees, whoever you may be
You need to go down south (south)
You need to shut your mouth (mouth)
It’s all about no doubt, just shout, cause we turn it out

Whose house? (“Say what?”)
Run’s house (“Say what?”)
Whose house? (“Say what?”)
Run’s house (“Say what?”)

“Say what? Say what?”
“Say what? Say what?”
“Say what?”

===== Run–D.M.C. - Beats to the Rhyme =====
27 ContributorsBeats to the Rhyme Lyrics
DJ's and MC's, coming up next is the one and only
Incredible, Jam Master
Yo, back up off the ropes, punk

Beats to the rhyme, of the rhyme I just made
Party at the jammie til lights the night fade
Trooping for the feature we all get paid
So let's go

Yo! D that's me, the King, the MC
Rhyme get mine on the t-o-p
Can another MC ever **** with me? (Hell no!)

It's like the A the B to the C
It's easier than (1, 2, 3)
(He's Jam Master Jay, I'm D.M.C.)
So hit it Run!
It's time for we to cease (So what?)
So rhymers speak your peace
Why? Cause you can't touch (Jam Master Jay)
Cause he's number (1, 2, 3, 4, hit it)
(Let's dance) to the rhythm, the rhyme, the cold flow
Chance that I gave em is done I told yo
For these routines like 1983
It's just a little reminder
So those suckas is kinder
A little message from (Run-D.M.C.)

Cuts for days will amaze and maze
But will make you sad to tan all the dance aways
Got the mic, the man, the master plan
But the ram, the jam
(Know I am?) Goddamn!
Spins he wins, clocking endless ends
To his friends he lends, lotta joy he sends
Jay lose today, this is what I say
(Dick in your mouth all day)

My beats were played and laid rhymes made
Jay DJ'ed and I got paid
Made something out of nothing (Yo D that's true)
Yes my brother I would do it for you
I roam in the zone of the microphone
And I'm on the throne but I'm not alone
Got bones of steel and not of stone
I'm known to be prone and make your momma moan

Time for the rhyme so let the stars shine
Shame for the fame and the name combined
Run for the fun but you can gimme your ring
Show I gotta go so now a word from the King

Hardcore, rhymes galore, giving you more
And like I said before...
Beats to the rhyme the name of this jam
D that's me and that's who I am
Rocking on the mic cause you know I can
You gotta understand I don't give a damn!

Jay here to play today, I must say
Arranged in the way that is A-OK
As we wax the tracks all the DJ's play
With (dick in your mouth)
A little (dick in your mouth)
A big (dick in your mouth all day)

27 ContributorsHard Times Lyrics
Hard times spreading just like the flu
Watch out, homeboy, don't let it catch you
P-p-p-prices go up, don't let your pocket go down
When you got short money, you're stuck on the ground
Turn around, get ready, keep your eye on the clock
And be on point for the future shock

Hard times
Hard times

Hard times are coming to your town
So stay alert, don't let them get you down
They tell you times are tough, you hear that times are hard
But when you work for that ace you know you pulled the right card
Hard times got our pockets all in chains
I'll tell you what, homeboy, it don't have my brain
All day, I have to work at my peak
Because I need that dollar every day of the week

Hard times

Hard times can take you on a natural trip
So keep your balance and don't you slip
Hard times is nothing new on me
I'm gonna use my strong mentality
Like the cream of the crop, like the crop of the cream
B-b-b-beating hard times, that is my theme
Hard times in life, hard times in death
I'm gonna keep on fighting 'til my very last breath

Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times
Hard times

===== Run–D.M.C. - Tougher Than Leather =====
14 ContributorsTougher Than Leather Lyrics
Unconceivable, unbelievable
Grammar like a hammer information receivable
Sent by the Lord, here and abroad
With words well adored now they can't be ignored!

For-For-For-Force of course that makes Run the boss
So get lost because I just toss a punk
Make way today and if I may I say
I make pay with Jay, so get away OKAY?
Gainin' weight, I ate the whole plate to date
Never rate the great, I go state to state
Just peep and keep but don't sleep or weep
Get deep to leap or I'll beep the Jeep
Put down the clown, get 'round the town
I found the sound and I'll pound the ground
Get paid and laid, not 'jayed or 'fraid
So I stayed and made, not a bad debate
Got a group to troop, with a shoop de shoop
Shoot hoop then scoop, on this loop to loop
Goin off and on, not soft of course
Just black and back to go back and forth
Go to school and cool, not drool or pool
Got soul and gold and cold hold a jewel
Upset the best, I met, met a jest
Just lest the pest, and I am the best
Got a punch to crunch, cold munch for lunch
Not Grady or the lady from the Brady Bunch
Got G's and Lees, like D's and T's
Charge B's to freeze, all MC's with ease
No dope to cope, just good to go
There's hope to Pope, big nope for nope
Quite clever and never, we're together forever
Run-D.M.C. and we're "Tougher Than Leather"

{*guitar solo*}

Strong and mighty, hard as can be
The perception of the life were as strong as D
Never frightened I'm writin, writin for what's right
Not schemin thievin in the night, I'm keepin with my mic
I got to go for broke, and I ain't no joke
I won't yoke and choke, 'cept the suckers I smoked
Bumrush and crush, leave 'em in the dust
I choose to bust the bust, the scums who mess with us
Only strong survive, and the weak will die
As long as I'm alive I keep my head up high
Because I'm strong in body, and smart in mind
I was born to rhyme, as a gift to mankind
No punk or chump, never givin no slack
We'll be killin a villain and like chillin, "Yo black!"
I'm not a bum, I'm not dumb, it's me you run from
I'm the king I do my things until my Kingdom Come!
{*guitar solo*}

Cause I'm
Rough and tough, cold huff and puff
Don't bluff the stuff, got enough to muff
Go long and on, no longer song
Go on and on just for past the dawn
Put preach and teach, with a speech to reach
All streets and each, with beats for treats
Got the King Supreme, may seem the clean
With a beat and a ring, no dream machine
Not a gang to bang, out to hang with slang
Talking yang and tang, about everythang
Just brothers and others, like fathers and mothers
Who discovered they love us that think they're up and above us
No crime or time, just rhyme and I'm
Full grown and own, no phone or dime
Just cut the stuff, til you get enough
Cause we're rougher than tougher and rougher tougher than tough!

{*guitar solo*}

Ah with a voice like thunder, words of wonder
Over all standin tall and the suckers fall under
Posessed with power, cowards will cower
Ducks we devour hour hour after hour
Three man riot, you can't deny it
We're so ill that you can't defy it
Gonna live, POSITIVE, forever, AND EVER
Run-D.M.C. and we're "Tougher Than Leather"

===== Run–D.M.C. - Jam-Master Jay =====
20 ContributorsJam Master Jay Lyrics
Kick off shoes, jump on the jock
Listen to the Jam Master as he starts to rock
His name is Jay and he's on his way
To be the best DJ in the US of A

J-A-Y are the letters of his name
Cutting and scratching are the aspects of his game
So check out the Master as he cuts these jams
And look at us with the mics in our hands
Then take a count, one, two, three
Jam Master Jay, Run-DMC

He's Jam Master Jay, the big beat blaster
He gets better 'cause he know he has to
In '84, he'll be a little faster
And only practice makes a real Jam Master

We're live as can be, not singing the blues
We got to tell y'all all the good news
The good news is that there is a crew
Not five, not four, not three, just two
Two MCs who are claiming the fame
And all other things won't be the same
Because it's about time for a brand new group
Run-DMC to put you up on the scoop
We make the fly girls scream in ecstasy
We rock the freshest rhymes at a party
We put all the fellas in a daze
It's everyone that we amaze
And we got the master of a disco scratch
There's not a break that he can't catch
Jam Master Jay, that is his name
And all wild DJs, he will tame
Behind the turntables is where he stands
Then there is the movement of his hands
So when asked who's best, y'all should say
Run-DMC and Jam Master Jay

Jam Master Jay is the one in charge
It's up to him to rock beats that are truly large
He is the master of the scratch and cut
So move your arms, so move your legs, so won't you move your butt?

We're not talking ground, we're not talking sky
We're not talking low, we're not talking high
We're not talking big, we're not talking small
We want all of the people on off the wall
We're not talking night, we're not talking day
But we're talking 'bout Jam Master Jay

Huh, huh
Ha, ha, ha

===== Run–D.M.C. - Raising Hell =====
32 ContributorsRaising Hell Lyrics
Kings from Queens, from Queens come kings
We're raisin' hell like a class when the lunch bell rings
The king will be praised and hell will be raised
S-S-S-Suckers try to faze him, but D won't be fazed
So what's your name? D.M.C., the King is me
Your Highness, or His Majesty
Now you can debate, you c-c-c-concentrate
But you can't imitate D.M.C. the Great
Dissin' all devils, causin' havoc in Hell
At a very high level bass and treble shall yell
Heard in the heavens are the sounds supreme
So clear to the ear it is sometimes seen
So loud like a cloud with thunder and lightning
So proud to the crowd it is somewhat frightening
No calm in the storm like a beast unleashed
There's no stoppin' 'cause the rockin' cannot cease, break

You see it's harder than hard, not one bit soft
Courageous and contagious, so you better break North
Not a cold, on a roll, did you hear me cough?
Just listen while I'm dissin' 'cause you're pissin' me off
Cold bedding is spreading all across your face
You can't take when I break and if that's the case
I'll go on and on and kick the bass
So back up off the cup while I take my taste

It's highly appraised when the hell is raised
So demanding and commanding that you all stand dazed
The unbelieving receiving prophecy so true
I cut the head off the devil and I throw it at you
My mighty mic control already brought his soul
The rock king is so bold when he rocks and roll
A black hat is my crown, symbolizin' the sound
Signifyin', we won't play around, bust it

Rhymin' and climbin', beat-makin' every day
No synthesizer sound, so silence when I say
I am great, get it straight, 'cause that's by fate
My name is Run, I'm number one, that's how I rate
He's in the place with the bass, and style and grace
His name is Jay, he's here to play and win this race
He's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D
Kind of tall, yes, y'all, he's down with me

From the mountain valley to the deep blue sea
The word is heard as told by D
I don't sing, I bring much delight
Like a star shinin' bright in the darkest night
If you are cold, I'll bring you heat
Like I brought the whole world my funky beat
Mysterious and serious, I ain't no joke
Fire from the depths of hell and you can smell the smoke

Kickin' and tickin' while you're havin' a ball
Like chicken, finger lickin' I'll be vickin' you all
So do The Bird, have you heard, did they give you a call?
Just me and D.M.C., cold shakin' the walls
There's no fearin' when hearin' sound of this kind
Across the land every man is goin' out of his mind
On the face of the earth spreading like disease
Contaminating, infiltrating like a horde of bees

Lord of lyrics, duke of discussion
Ruler of rock, and king at cold-crushin'
Puller of people, controller of crowds
Lingering lyrics, long-lasting and loud
Left, y'all, a-to the left, y'all
Because I rock up on the mic real def, y'all
And to the right, y'all, a-to the right, y'all
Because I rock up on the mic all night, y'all

You see, I want respect, if I'm correct
They're all like a ball that I have checked
And the shots they take have no effect
The punk tried to dunk, but he broke his neck
'Cause I rock harder and I get farther
You wanna battle D? Hey, please, don't bother
To waste your time, messin' with my rhyme
The only kick you'll get out of it is in your behind

The brother had it going on with something kinda, uh (Shoop)
Wicked, wicked, had to kick it
I'm not shy, so I asked for the digits (Shoop)
A ho, no, that don't make me
See what I want, slip-slide to it swiftly
Felt it in my hips so I dipped back to my bag of tricks
Then I flipped for a tip, make me wanna do tricks on him (Shoop)
Lick him like a lollipop should be licked
Came to my senses and I chilled for a bit

If looks could kill you would be an Uzi
Or a shotgun, bang! What's up with that thang?
I wanna know, How does it hang? (Shoop)
Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover
Like Prince said you're a sexy motha— well, uh (Shoop)

What a mighty good man (You got to say it again now)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Yeah, he's a mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Yes, he is)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Oh, uh, yeah)

I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are hoes, he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic to let it
Get me involved in that he said, she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it, and believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
Hahaha, you so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby (Ow)

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Alright, yes, he is)
What a man, what a man, what a man

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Yeah, hey)

My man is smooth like Barry and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home, he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me every time I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on cloud nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Mine'll rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mack ****
But every time they tried I said, "That's not it"
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like 7-Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me 'cause good men are hard to find

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, yeah, he's a  mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man (Ooh, alright)
What a mighty good man (Say it again now)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, ooh-ooh)
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Oh, I said what a mighty good man)

You know what I'm sayin'? He's a mighty, mighty good man, y'all
Y'all don't hear me, now check him out

My man gives real loving, that's why I call him killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker, 'cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that (I've got a good man)

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man (Uh, a mighty, mighty good man)
What a man, what a man, what a man (Yeah, talk to 'em)
What a mighty good man (Yes, he is, oh)
What a man, what a man, what a man

What a mighty good man (He's a mighty, mighty good man, y'all)

Uh, what a mighty, mighty good man, y'all
Yeah, what a mighty good man
Yeah, hoo

Yo, I don't think we should talk about this

People might misunderstand what we're tryin' to say, you know?
(No, but that's a part of life)
Come on

Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

Let's talk about sex for now
To the people at home or in the crowd
It keeps coming up anyhow
Don't be coy, avoid, or make void the topic
Cause that ain't gonna stop it
Now we talk about sex on the radio and video shows
Many will know, anything goes
Let's tell it like it is, and how it could be
How it was, and of course, how it should be
Those who think it's dirty have a choice
Pick up the needle, press pause, or turn the radio off
Will that stop us, Pep? I doubt it
All right then, come on, Spin

Let's talk about sex, baby

Hot to trot, make any man's eyes pop
She use what she got to get whatever she don't got
Fellas drool like fools, but then again they're only human
The chick was a hit because her body was boomin'
Gold, pearls, rubies, crazy diamonds
Nothin' she ever wore was ever common
Her dates, heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
Or even mess with, the Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you, it's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
She had it all in the bag so she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had
No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note
That last night was dope

Oh, hey, ooh, ooh, ooh, take it easy now
Uh, alright

Let's talk about sex, baby (Sing it)
Let's talk about you and me (Sing it, sing it)
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex (Come on)
Let's talk about sex (Do it)
Let's talk about sex (Uh-huh)
Let's talk about sex

Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies, let's talk about sex, all right
Come on, all the ladies, let's talk about sex, all right
Yo, Pep, I don't think they're gonna play this on the radio
(And why not? Everybody has sex)
I mean, everybody should be makin' love
(Come on, how many guys you know make love?)

Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

What we have here is subject to controversy
A three-letter word some regard as a curse, see
He may fiend and have a wet dream
Because he seen a teen in tight jeans
What makes him react like that is biological
But scheme of gettin' in those jeans, is diabolical
But of course he does it, and she gives him rap
And before you even know it, they jump in the sack
As a matter of fact, sometimes it’s like that
But anyway, ready or not, here he cums
And like a dumb son-of-a-gun, oops, he forgot the condoms
“Oh well,” you say, “what the hell, it’s chill
I won’t get got, I’m on the pill"
Until the sores start to puff and spore
He gave it to you, and now it’s yours

Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

===== Salt-N-Pepa - None Of Your Business =====
25 ContributorsNone of Your Business Lyrics
What's the matter with your life?
Why you gotta mess with mine?
Don't keep sweating what I do
'Cause I'm gonna be just fine, check it out

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm giving skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

Now who do you think you are
Putting your cheap two cents in?
Don't you got nothing to do
Than worry 'bout my friends? Check it

I can't do nothing, girl, without somebody bugging
I used to think that it was me, but now I see it wasn't
They told me to change, they called me names, and so I popped one
Opinions are like assholes and everybody's got one
I never put my nose where I'm not supposed to
Believe me, if he's something that I want, I'm stepping closer
I'm not one for playing hypo
Like the high saditty 90210 type of ho
I treat a man like he treats me
The difference between a hooker and a ho ain't nothing but a fee
So hold your tongue tightly, wish you could be like me
You're popping all that mess only to stress and to spite me
Now you can get with that or you can get with this
But I don't give a shit, 'cause really it's none of your business

1993
S-N-P, packing and macking
Bamboozling and smacking suckers with this track, and
Throw the beat back in

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm giving skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

How many rules am I to break before you understand
That your double-standards don't mean shit to me?
I know exactly what you say when I turn and walk away
But that's okay, 'cause I don't let it get it to me
Now every move I make, somebody's clocking
Don't ask me nothing, will you just leave me alone?
Never mind who's the guy that I took home
To bone

Okay, miss thing, never giving up skins
If you don't like him or his friends what about that Benz?
Yo, Pep-Pep's got a ill rep
With all that macaroni trap for rap, you better step
Or better yet, get your head checked
'Cause I refuse to be played like a penny cent trick deck of cards
No, I ain't hard like the bitches on a boulevard
My face ain't scarred and I don't dance in bars
You can call me a tramp if you want to
But I remember the punk who just humped and dumped you
Oh, you can front if you have to
But everybody gets horny just like you
So, yo, so, yo, ho
Check it, double-deck it on the regular butt-naked
Pep's ass gets respected, miss
But its none of your business

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm giving skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

So the moral of this story is
Who are you to judge?
There's only one true judge, and that's God
So chill, and let my Father do His job

'Cause Salt and Pepa's got it swinging again
'Cause Salt and Pepa's got it swinging again
'Cause Salt and Pepa's got it swinging again
'Cause Salt and Pepa's got it swinging again
'Cause Salt and Pepa's got it swinging again
'Cause Salt and Pepa's got it swinging again

===== Salt-N-Pepa - Expression =====
14 ContributorsExpression LyricsOh yeah, oh yeah
You know life is all about expression
You only live once, and you're not coming back
So express yourself, yeah
CHORUS
Express yourself, you gotta be you and only you, babe
Express yourself, and let me be me
Express yourself, don't tell me what I cannot do, baby
Come on and work your body
Now Joe wanna be like Bob
Bob got it goin' on with no job
And everything Rob got he got from Robin
And everything she got she got ho-hoppin'
My girl Jilly wanna be like Jackie
Fat rope chains and I think that's wick-wacky
Tom and Dick wanna be like Harry
Little do they know he's bitin' on Barry
Stan was a scam, but Vinnie's legit
Mercedes coupe hometroop with no kit
A businessman with a beeper for a reason
Not like Tim because it's in this season
CHORUS

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Hey Pep, you up next
Yes, I'm Pep and there ain't nobody
Like my body, yes, I'm somebody
No, I'm sorry, I'm-a rock this Mardi Gras
Until the party ends, friends
Yes, I'm blessed, and I know who I am
I express myself on every jam
I'm not a man, but I'm in command
Hot damn, I got an all-girl band
And I wear the gear, yeah, I wanna wear it, too
I don't care, dear, go ahead and stare (oooo)
Afraid to be you, livin' in fear (boo)
Expression is rare, I dare you

Express yourself, you've got to be you, babe
Express yourself, and let me be me
Express yourself, don't tell me what to do, babe
Express yourself, come on and work that body
Oh yeah, oh yeah...
Yo, excuse us while we rap
Go ahead, girls, express yourself!

My party, your party, anytime drop in
Cold hip-hop is always rockin'
Don't you like it when the music drop
Jump, spread out, and stop?
Now bring in the go-go (uh-oh)
Look at how my butt go rock from left to the right
You wanna step to me, groove me
I know you wanna do me
Come on now, fellas, don't fight
At my door they're bum-rushin'
To hear the percussion
Sound of my go-go band
I've long ago learned my lesson
It's all about expression
Will the real Salt and Pepa please stand?
And...
Express yourself, you've got to be you, babe
Express yourself, and let me be me
Express yourself, don't tell me what to do, babe
Express yourself, come on and work that body
Express yourself, you've got to be you, babe
Express yourself, don't tell me what to do, babe

===== Salt-N-Pepa - I'll Take Your Man =====
12 ContributorsI’ll Take Your Man Lyrics
Salt and Pepa's back, and we came to out-rap you
So get out my face before I smack you
Ho, don't you know? Can't you understand?
If you mess with me I'll take you man

Well I'll take your man right out the box
And put him under my padlocks
So when you see us together chillin' in the place
Cold walkin' and sportin' him in your face
Go ahead roll your eyes, suck your teeth
Keep huffin' and puffin' like a dog in heat
You can call me a crook, a robber, a thief
But I'll be your butcher if you got beef
You know what's up, I ain't no poo-putt
'Cause Pepa kick butts off dumb, young bucks like you
And the rest of your crew
If moms want static I'll diss her, too
So scram, you know who I am
Damn chick, don't play me, punk, 'cause I'll take your man

I'll take your man whenever I feel like it
This ain't a threat or a bet, it's a damn promise
From me to you, your sex life's through
If you get another lover, I'll take him, too
All I have to do is say a rhyme or two
And he'll hop and leave you like a kangaroo
I'll make him heel for me, even steal for me
His mother and father, he'd kill for me
That's what you get for trying to play smart
Now take a hike with that slayed-up heart
Girl, you don't know if you're comin' or goin'
Look at your face, your jealousy's growin' and showin'
Don't get mad, you don't have the right
I throw below solo but ladylike on the mic
Psyche is where I win my battles
I'll handle you like a baby with a rattle
Don't make me prove to you that I can
Either give him up or get slammed, I'll take your man

I'll take your man, that's right, but just for spite
Because you tried to dis me when I was on the mic
But I really don't want him, the guy ain't fly, shoot
He can't afford to buy a Fila suit
Runs the same old gear, never has fresh wear
What he whispered in my ear I can't repeat here
I don't wanna seem to be so damn mean
But you're the hippiest critter I've ever seen
Before I got on the stage you wished me good luck
Turned around and told your friends I suck
Well look at you now, you ain't got nobody
Searching for love in a fifth of Bacardi
You look bad, girl, you look like you're dying
Ain't no use in crying, I'll take your man
Yo, Cher, school this fool!

I'll take your man, your fiancee, your husband
You ain't Alice, this ain't Wonderland
And when I say I will, you know I can
Don't mess with me 'cause I'll take your man
I'll take your man anytime, at the drop of a dime
'Cause he's rappin' and strappin' so hard on mine
Everywhere I turn, everywhere I look
The brother's eyein' me down, he's staring down my throat
But he's a ducker sucker, soft-hearted punk
Goin' skiing for skeezers, stunts for blunt
So that's why y'all have so many things in common
Him for just robbin', you for lap slobbin'
I never ever went out my way to get played
I keep guys like yours held down at bay
You know I can, I got the upper-hand
Tramp, you don't stand a chance, 'cause I'll take your man

Most girls have guys that's good to go
But yours is slow, he's a freakin' a-hole
The fact still stands, there's no change in plans
"Yo, Pepa, your wish is my command!"
Now you know, you know I'll take your...man
Check him out, you see what I mean?
He's leading the pack as the fellas scream
"Go, Sandy! Get busy! Go, Sandy! Get busy!"
It's so easy to make 'em fall for me, Heather
No man can resist Salt and Pepa
Because we're perfect from head to toe
It's not speculation, your man says so
Revenge is sweet but payback's a trip
Girlfriend, you won't know which is which
But I'll tell you this: don't try to answer this jam
Because if you do then I'll take your...
And I'll take your...
And we'll take your man

A sexy girl might ease that antedote to poison
Boys in the jam ask me to dance, but I say no chance
I want a man who's advanced in the art of dance
So when we get on a floor, he can take me on a tour
And we can do it till the fluid or sweat starts to pour
Down like the rain and the thunderstorm hard and strong
Boy, come on, don't wait too long

One good twist deserves a better one, a deffer one
We're Salt and Pepa, together we'll have lots of fun
Do it again, babe, for the hit parade
Cuz Spinderella does a hell of a job keepin' the record playin'
Shout like ya just sold your soul to rock 'n roll
You lost control, go hit the floor

And shake it up, baby, now (Shake it up, baby)
Come on, twist and shout (Twist and shout)

Album:  Blacks' Magic
Song:   Do You Want Me
You said it loud, and I heard you
Never tried to hurt you
Some say I'm old-fashioned
I like to take my time and do it slow
You know with the flow
But don't try to rush it
So ride it like a horse
And let nature take its course
Get to know each other
Be my friend not just my lover
Share your thoughts with me
Love my mind not just my body, baby
CHORUS
Do you really want me, baby?  Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like
Please understand the way I feel
I must have trust or there's no deal
My emotion's ain't to be
Played with or given free
I appreciate greatly
The way you toleratered me
Sometimes I do act flaky
I wouldn't blame you if you hate me
You put up with my butt
When I wouldn't give it up
Yeah, I know that really sucks
But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up

CHORUS
Who me?  A tease?  Brother, please
You're just having bad memories
About some skeeze who did the squeeze
And had you on your hands and knees
Look, I am telling you straight out
That's not what I'm all about
I'd just be playing myself out
If I spent the night at your house
Now don't get me wrong
I didn't mean to turn you on
We haven't known each other long
But this is my life not just a song

Tramp

Homegirls, attention you must pay
So listen close to what I say
Don't take this a simple rhyme
'Cause this type of thing happens all the time
Now what would you do if a stranger said "Hi"?
Would you diss him or would you reply?
If you answer there is a chance
That you'd become a victim of circumstance
Am I right, fellas? Tell the truth
Or else I'ma have to show and prove
You are what you are, I am what I am
It just so happens that most men are...

Tramp (What'd ya call me?)

Have you ever seen a dude who's stupid and rude?
Whenever he's around he dogs your mood
I know a guy like that, girl
He thinks he's God's gift to the world
You know that kind, excited all the time
With nothing but sex on the mind
I'm no stunt, on me he can't front
I know the real deal, I know what they want
It's me (Why?) Because I'm so sexy
It's me (What?) Don't touch my body! (Boy!)
'Cause you see I ain't no skeezer
But on a real tip I think he's a...

Tramp (What'd ya call me?)

On the first date he thought I was a dummy
He had the nerve to tell me he loved me
But of course, I knew it was a lie, y'all
He undressed me with his eyeballs
Trying to change the whole subject
'Cause everything he said pertained to sex
So I dissed him, I said, "You's a sucker!
Get your dirty mind out the gutter
You ain't gettin' paid, you ain't knockin' boots
You ain't treating me like no prostitute"
Then I walked away, he called me a teaser
You're on a mission kid, yo, he's a...

Show 'em what ya got

Ayo, show 'em what ya got, 'cause shit is gettin' hot
Show-show 'em what ya got, 'cause shit is gettin' hot
Show 'em what ya got, 'cause shit is gettin' hot
Ayo, show 'em what ya got, 'cause shit is gettin' hot
Show 'em what ya got

Somebody's gettin' on my nerves
Somebody's gettin' on my nerves

Somebody's gettin' on my nerves (Show 'em what ya got)
Somebody's gettin' on my nerves (Show 'em what ya got)
Somebody's gettin' on my nerves (Show-show 'em what ya got)
Somebody's gettin' on my nerves
Forget that you're a lady and give 'em what they deserve

Now I've got this real phat attitude because of all the hype
Jealous-ass rappers broke as hell try to play me on the mic
So test my respect, mess around, yeah, bitch
Jump up and get beat down!
Now Salt shorty, light-skinned, sexy, and your man know
I got him screamin' like a hooker in the front row
So you better check my record, better yet, bum
My name is too big for a record, check my Platinum album
It's not meant for you to do
You even sound wack when you try to check the mic
(One-two, one-two), but wait, I'm not through
How you livin' sayin' old rhymes tryin' to get new?
You don't work like the two to make hip-hop
So you can talk until your big, suckin' lips pop
The next time you try to play me, you might catch a fist to the nose, ho
So there you go

You hear talk about Pep around the way gettin' skeezed
Yo, me and my man was with Pepa last night, yo, nigga, please
You couldn't hump me if my first name was Cooty Cat
Your little jimmy can't even hold your zipper back
Why don't you tell the story right, man?
The only skins you ever hit was the skins on your right hand
You rolled up on me in your man's Bimmer
And I could look at you and tell you was a meat-beatin' daydreamer
You put the window down, tryna act real slick
And started smilin' like a hooker with a bag of tricks
You stuck your hand out the window tryna show me gold
Your 42nd Street Rolex was kinda old
I wrote a number, and I know you thought you'd get humped
But it was Dial-A-Date, 1-900-CHUMP
So why you runnin' 'round town playin' Jeopardy?
Get off my bra strap, boy, stop sweatin' me

Somebody's gettin' on my nerves
Somebody's gettin' on my nerves
Somebody's gettin' on my nerves
Forget that you're a lady and give 'em what they deserve

Give 'em what they deserve
Give 'em what they deserve
Give 'em what they deserve
Forget that you're a lady and give 'em what they deserve

Now somebody's gettin' on my nerves, and I'm read' to get crazy
It never fails to amaze me
How people never miss a possib' and just believe the gossip
Instead of finding out the truth of what's up
It's got my nostrils flairin'
I'd be a fool if I believe half of the dumb shit I be hearing
'Cause every time I meet a guy that's got it goin' on
One of my jealous girlfriends gotta find something that's wrong
If he's not drivin' a Benz or Bimmer, then he's bummy
Or he's sellin' buddha if he's got plenty of money
Now ask me why, I don't know why, oh well, oh what the hell
Stop breakin' up the code because someone's getting jeal'

And like the boom in the bass about to explode

So every time you see me on the mic, you know you just can't let go
So here we go again, sexy in a twin-pack
Straight from my eyes down to my back, stacked

Salt-N-Pepa said groove with me, groove with me

Groove me

Anything else could be a laugh to me, G

Are you ready?

Pump, pump, let me see you jump, shake your rump
Push it real good, break it down with the funk
One love, like the LB say, right
Music makes us high
But you've been giving shade 'cause I stay paid
Sippin' lemonade, don't be mad 'cause I got it made
Diva-hatin', waitin' snake in the grass
Look me up and down when I pass with ya sneaky ass
Vibin' with your girlfriends
Jealous of my dividends and my Benz and my ends
Like no other, butter-smooth like cream
I keep it milky when I moves on the scene
Got you fiending, on lockdown, can't you tell?
Never fell, Black queens doing it well
We be the crew that you wanna step to
Sisters with an attitude (Uh), now how my mic sounds?

My mic sound nice (Check one, check two)
Everybody make way (Party people coming through)
Throw your hands up (Put 'em up), bounce (Hold steady)
Are you ready?
My mic sound nice (Check one, check two)
Everybody make way (Party people coming through)
Throw your hands up (Put 'em up), bounce (Hold steady)

We make you burn with the hot track, spin and scratch the hot wax
So I could grab the microphone and climax
Bars stay lean and cream keep stacking
Dr. Suess cracking the beats with no slacking
So move with the groove, make your knees weaker
Salt-N-Pepa coming through your speaker
Hot blazing, so amazing
Hundred fifty proof raisin' the roof, who got the juice now?
Yeah, papa, I'ma break you off something proper
Show-stopper like Frankie Crocker
Female phenomenon when you get off, then put me on
Miss Jiggy, hell yeah, huh, the bomb diggy
Microphone check one, two
Brand new coming through, you know how we do
Stay on point like a needle, who are you to judge like Ito?

I'm 'bout to make the whole world bounce, make it freaky 'til you're drippin'
Salt-N-Peppa got me in the VI sippin'
On the dance floor, non-stop how we movin' in
Game so tight lubrication couldn't loosen it
B-L-A-Q the bomb, y'all know
Chi-Ca, Chi-Co who matching my flow?
Shake what your mama created until it hurt ya
Daddy came to freak it down and work ya, what time is it?

P to the E to the P to the A
Lay my game down precise like every day
Display many styles for years, I've been here
Iced-out sex appeal, I put your lights out
Pull your mics out, we rock the party
Freak your body, no need for a shotty
I'm gonna make you sweat all night, hold tight
All heads turn when I snatch the mic
Send the party into orbit
Coppin' drop tops 'cause I can afford it, ain't nothin'
Party over here, what you doing on the other side?
We came here to get live, take a ride
With the S and the P, hey, Pep MC
Shine every time just like the Lex be
You wanna test me, don't floss
We got the flow that'll break you off decent
Leave you locked like the precinct, how we get down?
Worldwide, everybody know about the sound
Let it pound in your system one time
All up in your mind how we shine? Genuine

16 ContributorsMy Mic Sounds Nice Lyrics
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Yo, Hurb, take it from the top
One, two

My mic sound nice, check one
My mic sound nice, check two
My mic sound nice, check three
Are you ready to rock-rock, y'all?
A-to the beat, y'all?
A-keep on and you don't stop
Rockin' on
Keep rockin' on

I'm a queen on the mic, and it's true when I say
That the Pepa MC is here to stay
And you know if I was a book, I would sell
'Cause every curve on my body got a story to tell
Yeah, word 'em up (Word 'em up)
W-word 'em up (Word 'em up)
'Cause I'm so fly, nobody can deny
The girl hasn't been born that can deal with I
Me, Sandy D., undoubtedly def
Don't need to be dressed, I'm fresh to the flesh, yes
So tough, you know it is a must
Now Salt, get on the mic, and tell 'em why you go crush

'Cause I'm oh-ah, I'm on, I'm on
Yes, I'm oh-ah, I'm so damn on
Like a grasshopper hoppin' on the morning lawn
Like a needle on a record when it plays a song
Like Little Boy Blue blowin' on his horn
And you know I got to be on
MC's rockin' and shockin', but it won't last
Salt's on the mic, and I'm kickin', ask
Me no questions, I'll tell no lies
It's just a little warning, a word to the wise
You been hopin' and scopin', layin' and prayin'
But on the bottom is where you're staying
You're wack (Hahaha), I thought you understood
You're not related to me so you could never be good
I know you come from Babylon (And you know why?)
'Cause you're a babble-on MC (That's right)
You babble on the microphone about what you wish
But could never be, so please
Don't tell me how you're gonna rock
Don't brag about the things that you ain't got
Don't feed me lines 'cause now I'm full
My cow just died, I don't need your bull (Your bull)

Yo, yo, turn my mic up a little bit
One, two, one, two, alright, thanks

My mic sound nice, check one
My mic sound nice, check two
My mic sound nice, check three

Right about now as you can see in the place to be
We're not talking 'bout geometry
History or biology
So Sandy D., explain this to me
Why do they call you the Pepa MC?
You mean you don't know? (Uh-uh) That's a shame
Okay, Salt, let me explain

I'm hot like a fire, burned down, diminished
Oh, now I see! Chill, let me finish
I wanna make one and all understand
I don't play, I slay when the mic's in my hand
The room temperature reaches a hundred and four
You can scramble eggs on the floor
Blood pressure soars, the crowd, they roar
Sweat will drip down to your drawers
The Pepa MC is like hot ice
And I paid the price to make the mic sound nice

Forget about the rest, yes, I don't jest
You're blessed with one of America's best
So I think ya all better count your blessings
When Salt's in the house, hell's in session
It's a fact that I will wax
MCs out there are gonna get taxed
Rockin' to my funky beat
I'm a trip so I know you're gonna fall for me
'Cause this is the year all men fear
Female MCs is movin' up here
Salt and Pepa is strictly biz
You know the color of this, you know what time it is
"Super" is the strength of the boomin' bass
"Nature" describes our pretty face
Turning out without a doubt
Make no mistake, Queens is in the house

Yeah, check it out
Check-check it out

===== Snoop Dogg - Young, Wild & Free =====
115 ContributorsYoung, Wild & Free Lyrics
Is this thing on? Word

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees (Shit)
So what we go out? (Ayy, lemme get a lighter, please?)
That's how it's supposed to be ('Cause you know I'm high as fuck and I forgot one)
Living young and wild and free (Keep that in there)

Ah, ah-ah
So what, I keep 'em rolled up?
Saggin' my pants, not carin' what I show
Keep it real with my niggas, keep it player for these hoes
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A

You know what? It's like I'm seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face, lookin' on the case
Tryna find a hella taste, oh, my God
I'm on the chase, Chevy, It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Upfront, four blunts, like, "Khalifa put the weed in a J"

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Uh, and I don't even care
'Cause if me and my team in there
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em, Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Uh, now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Yeah, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this, you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just havin' fun
So we just roll one, smoke one
When you live like this, you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just havin' fun

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Don't fool with the player with the cool whip
Yeah, yeah, you know I'm always on that cool shit
Walk to it, do it how you do it
Have a glass, let me put you in the mood, and
Little cutie, looking like a student
Long hair with your big fat booty
Back in the days, you was a girl I went to school with
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Hit her off with some pimp-pimp fluid
Mommy, don't worry, I won't abuse it
Hurry up and finish so we can watch Clueless
I laugh at these niggas when they ask, "Who do this?"
But everybody know, ooh, girl, that you is

I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it
We just blow dro and keep the flow movin'

Body rag interior blue, and
Have them hydraulics squeakin' when we screwin'
Now she's yellin', hollerin' out "Snoop!" and

Girls be complaining you keep me boomin'
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone

You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you, and
You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and
Twist up my fingers, and wear dark blue, and

Shuttin' down the game
Be my head coach so you can
And never take me down 'til you can taste the win
Do it again and again till you say my name
And by the way I'm so glad

So I can give it to you rough like a first draft
Hold you like a paper plane, you know I got paper, babe
Them dollar bills, girl, make it rain
Holiday Inn, come and meet me on my eighth floor
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for the next door
And I, and I, I, I apologize

134 ContributorsAin’t No Fun (If the Homies Can’t Have None) Lyrics
You're back now at the Jack Off Hour
This is DJ EZ-Dicc
On WBallz
Right now, something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow-wow-wow
'Cause we gon' make it a little misty in here tonight
This is DJ EZ-Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass with a fat dick
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you, lady
But now I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise, baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
'Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch, I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke
I gets loced and loony, bitch, you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's somethin' that I learned in Tha Pound, so how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho?
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothin' else to do with it, pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt, ho, you'll never be my only one
Trick-ass bitch

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

Guess who's back in the motherfuckin' house
With a fat dick for your motherfuckin' mouth?
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
'Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do? You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin' damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger (Uh-huh)
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Named Snoop Doggy? I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see, it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it, 'cause you know I don't love it

Woo! Hey, now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready, and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '6-4 rag to be exact
With bitches on my side, and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm strugglin'
Just get on your knees, and then start jugglin'
These motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G, the nigga with the clout (Woo)

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

Konvict (Konvict, konvict)
Konvict, Music
And you know we Upfront

I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know, girl

Money in the air as mo' fell, grab you by your coat tail
Take you to the motel, ho sale, don't tell, won't tell
Baby said I don't talk, Dogg, but she told on me, oh well
Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do?
Baby, stick to me, and I'mma stick on you
If you pick me, then I'mma pick on you
D-O-double G and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
Rip ridinin' them poles and them doors is tight
And I'mma get me a shot for the end of the night
‘Cause pussy is pussy and, baby, your pussy for life

I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know, girl

Shorty, I can see, you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
So you lookin' at me now, what it's gonna be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Trying to get you up out this club
If it means spending a couple dubs
Throwing bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that ‘cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer, used to move 'phetamines
Girl, I spend money like it don't mean nothin'
And besides, I got a thing for you

I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know, girl

Mobbin' through the club in low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoking section (Just smokin', just smokin')
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby, I see you, see you)
It's cool, we jet, the mood is set, your pussy is wet
You rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck (Yeah, yeah)
Your body is movin', ya humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin' (Yeah)
You smilin' and grinnin' and lookin' at me

Girl, and while your looking at me
I'm ready to hit the Caddy right up on the patio
Move the patty to the Caddy
Baby, you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wanting to just give you everything
And that's kind of scary
‘Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass (Ass)
Bouncing, got me tipping my glass (Glass)
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know, girl
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (Fuck you), you already know, girl (Girl, girl)

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid, don't fuck with me
Are you tellin' me this is a sign?
She's lookin' in my eyes, and I see no other guys
Are you tellin' me this is a sign? Uncle Charlie (Oh)
Don't think about it, boy, leave her alone (Ooh wee)
Nigga, you ain't no G
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
You ain't no G

It's legit, you know it's a hit
When The Neptunes and the Doggy Dogg fin to spit
You know he's in tune with the season
Come here baby, tell me why you leavin'?
Tell me if it's weed that you need
If you wanna breathe, I got the best weed minus seeds
Ain't nobody trippin', VIP they can't get in
If somethin' go wrong then you know we get to Crippin'

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid, don't fuck with me
Are you tellin' me this is a sign?
She's lookin' in my eyes, and I see no other guys
Are you tellin' me this is a sign?
Don't think about it, boy, leave her alone (Oh, oh, yeah!)
Nigga, you ain't no G
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
(Do-do-do-do-do-do) You ain't no G

Now you stepping with a G, from Los Angeles
Where the helicopters got cameras
Just to get a glimpse of our Chucks
And our Khakis and our bouncin' cars
You with your friend, right? (Yeah)
She ain't tryna bring over no men, right? (No)
Shit, she ain't gotta be in the distance
She could get high all in an instant

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid, don't fuck with me
Are you tellin' me this is a sign?
She's lookin' in my eyes, and I see no other guys
Are you tellin' me this is a sign? (Oh-oh-ooh)

Nigga, you ain't no G
She likes my tone, my cologne and the way I roll
(Do-do-do-do-do-do) You ain't no G

Mami, Mamacita, have you ever flown on G5's
From London to Ibiza? You gotta have cake to
You'll have Sundays with chiquitas
You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena
And I can take you

(Uncle Charlie, preach)
Nigga, don't be young and foolish
You don't know what you're doin'
You don't know what you lost until she's gone (Til she's gone)
She got a pretty face, drove you wild
But you ain't have that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style

I'm not sure what I see
Cupid, don't fuck with me
Are you tellin' me this is a sign?
She's lookin' in my eyes, and I see no other guys
Are you tellin' me this is a sign? (Oh)
Don't think about it, boy, leave her alone (Ooh, wee!)

79 ContributorsBitch Please Lyrics
Yeah, time to bring your ass to the table, y’all
It’s X to the Z, Xzibit, yeah
Snoop double D, uh, OG (Where you at? West Coast, Los Angeles)
What
Bringin' it live, Dr. Dre, what
Throwin' up a big ass W
Coverin' up the world, right
Yeah, ha
Listen, look

You ain't tryna hot box with me, I swig hard liquor
Goin' down by the second round, all hail the underground
How that sound? Xzibit backin' down from a conflict
Fuck the nonsense! Terrorist, here to bomb shit
Glass and metal in every direction
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin'
Xzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back
9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that?
For me? It's blasphemy
You fuckin' around with the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk drivin', tryna stack my loot
While other rappers gettin' Treated Like a Prostitute, so check the SoundScan

All I wanna be was a G, ha
My whole life, nigga please, ha
Breakin' off these motherfuckin' keys, ha
Let's get these motherfuckin' G's, ha
Nigga, you don't wanna fuck with this

Oh, no, Big Snoop Dogg
Back up in the heezy, baby
You jockin' my style? You so crazy
Dre say, ain't no limit to this
As long as we drop gangsta shit
Look here, bitch, you fine and I dig your style
Come fuck with a nigga and do it doggy style
I'll be gentle, sentimental
Shit, we fucked in the rental
Lincoln Continental
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago

(Yeah, nigga, you know what's happenin', man) I get this pussy everywhere that I go
(These bitches know what time it is) Ask the bitches in your hood 'cause they know (Hell yeah)
(Hoes know about a nigga like me, man) I get this pussy everywhere that I go
(I pimp these hoes, nigga, ha-ha) Ask the bitches in your hood 'cause they know

Bitch, please! Get down on your goddamn knees
For this money, chronic, clothes and weed (Look)
Look, you fuckin' with some real O.G.'s, bitch please
Bitch, please!
Get down on your motherfuckin' knees
We came to get the motherfuckin' cheese
Yeah, you fuckin' wit' some real O.G.’s, you dick tease

Bitch, please!
Now what you need to do is
Hem my coat, and roll me some dope (Fo' real)
Different strokes (Huh-uh) for different folks
Oh, you like settin' niggas up and gettin' them locs?
A cute little bitch with a whole lotta heart
Shit gets thick when the light gets dark
She say she got a lick for me (Well, hook it up)
Worth about 200 G's and 30 ki's!
Now check this out, Dre: now, if I don't move
Then a nigga like me, shit, I don't lose
But you know me, dog, I'm movin'!
Ain't nothing’ to it but to get to groovin'
You've been waitin' on a nigga like me (What's that?)
To take that chance and rob your man and beat up the pussy
A victim of the circumstance
That's the Devil, they always wanna dance
See we go out with a bang (Bang, bang)
I'm tryin' to work this cold thang
And take this whole thang

I get the money everywhere that I go (I go)
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho’ (Fo' sho’)
I get the money everywhere that I go (I go)
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho’ (Fo' sho’)

===== Snoop Dogg - That's That Shit =====
47 ContributorsThat’s That Shit Lyrics
Yeah, that's right, I like that
The royal penis is clean your highness
Thank you, uh, uh
Snoop, Kells
You know how we get down

I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (Hey) your boy Kells (Hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

Let's get this party jumpin', me and Kel' gon' get it bumpin'
They humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'
The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess that in the Chi' you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me hip you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone

I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (Hey), your boy Kells (Hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

Dippin' low, '64, hundred spokes and chronic smoke
All these ladies on the floor cause they know what we in here for
Dogg and Kelly came to ball, get your ass up off the wall
Let that middle wiggle now make that shit fall
Not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it, is that your crew?
Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
That this that shit, Kels sing that song, come on

I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (Hey) your boy Kells (Hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

So if you think you got the bomb shit
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
And if you lookin' for some good sex
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
Girl if you ever in the 3-1-2
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
And if you're ever in the 2-1-3
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa
Holla at a playa

I pull up, dip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like "That's that shit"
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like "That's that shit"
Snoop Dizzle (Hey) your boy Kells (Hey)
Let me hear you say "That's that shit"

60 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolVato Lyrics
Man, don't you know that I'm loco?
Mhm, hm

I was chillin' (Chillin') right around my way (Way)
21st, east side of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
Talkin' shit with his homies like he was a straight G
Askin' where I'm from while he runnin' up
Gangbang my set on e'ry one of 'em (20's, nigga, 20's)
Some things, sons, they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin' but the gangbang (Bang)
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggas runnin' like a marathon
Lil' G's tryna creep on the East with it
Talkin' 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (Mm)
But they don't know once they get close
It's tic-tac-toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (Watch out)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray, I heard a ese say, he said

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (Uh-huh)
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard
He started firing and then he just charged

(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run nigga, run nigga
(Blaow) Duck nigga, duck nigga
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run
(Blaow) Run, motherfucker, run

I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now there's three motherfuckers dead and I ain't seen shit
But these niggas'll scream for plea
But for a G like me, it's just a case, really, you could see
I crack the MAC back and pop off rollin'
And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin'
I haven't seen my mama in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggas say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were broads
Believin' all the things that you never saw
In it, y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow on my dope? What the fuck? No
See these niggas proceed with speed
So feel the need to bleed, all you hear my enemies goin'

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (Uh-huh)
They keep talkin' and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin' hard

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
If I didn't pop niggas in they mouth, goddamn
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggas with the heat (Heat)
You never seen a thug like this
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
In fact, I could be "Beast of the East", motherfucker
I never hesitate to blaze (Blaze)
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, 'cause my peoples
Is screamin' that we need more for fun or it's illegal
Ba-ba-bang on a song, make it feel like a drive-by (Drive-by)
It's a shame, but somebody gotta die (Die)
They see it happen state-to-state
But when I'm mobbin' L.A., all I hear the eses say, they go

Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw this pack of guys and they act real hard (And what they do?)
They twist their fingers, say, "You know who we are"

Yo what's Crip-a-latin'? This big Snoop Dogg
Leave your name and your number at the motherfucking beep
If this one of my hoes, 2-way me
Ayy, ayy, Snoop, what up? This your nigga Dre
Ayy, man I was thinking I ain't said shit on your whole motherfucking album
So check it out, put this on there:
All you motherfucking haters out there, can suck my motherfucking dick!
And we still smoking, what?!

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit 'til the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive 'cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the LBC
Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A

Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin' shit
Best move 'cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit?
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you in your dome (You little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Lugers, the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with?
The same clique he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hold they stare and act hard
That's even though your CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

What's up, pimpin'? It's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it realer, 'cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me 'cause I'm a million-dollar hitta
It's, No Limit 'til I D-I-E
CP3 or Richmond, Cali's where I be

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

Ayo, Jim, man, why don't ya...
Why don't you kick some of that, you know?
You-You know how you do it, man
It's a trip, people don't even believe we're together right now (Wow!)
Bu-, bu-, but tell your story
You know the one I like (Ride, ride, ride)
Say it for me

Riders on the storm
(Ride, ride, ride)
Riders on the storm
(Ride, ride, ride)
Into this house we're born
(Into this house we're born)
Into this world we're thrown
(Into this world we're thrown)
Like a dog without a bone (Woof, woof)
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm (Ride, ride, ride)
There's a killer on the road (Killer, killer, murder, murder, murder)
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
(Holidays, holidays)
Let your children play (C'me here and play)
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die (Ride, ride, ride)
Killer on the road (Killer, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder)
Yeah!

Goin' off of this, goin' off of that
With the Lizard king bumpin' in the back, how 'bout that?
Driftin', liftin', swiftin' (Let 'em in. let 'em in)
Coastin', testaroastin' (Yeah)
But the wheels won't stop (Won't stop)
200 on the highway, fresh up off the block
He's a rider? (Woo, woo) Naw, he's a killer
Dressed in all black, but his hat says Steeler (Steeler, Steeler)
Pedal to the metal (Metal)
I gotta go hard, drive by and say "hello"
Hey, Fredwreck, you my mello
Now let me hear what I sound like acapella (Shh)
Wow, ride, dip swish
Now bring it back, just like this
Like a dog without his bone
Unlike a G without his chrome
It's hard to imagine
The homie dog in a Jag and he's checkin' for the checkered flagin'
Comin' in first, never in last
'Cause my car too fast (Zoom, zoom)
I never ever run outta gas
'Cause I'm just too clean, I do it upperclass
So fasten your seat belts
It's so hot, it'd even make heat melt (Woo, woo)
So get a board and roll and ride
Slip through the slip and slide

Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road
Yeah

Woah!

===== Soulja Boy - Speakers Going Hammer =====
35 ContributorsSpeakers Going Hammer Lyrics
I wake up early in the morning 'round the crack of dawn and
Wave to my neighbors like what's up? (Say what's up?)
And I’m all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer-bammer-bammer

My speakers out of space like ET
Cops watch me all day like TV
SOD hit the club, we be so deep
Mayne I'm deep in the game I grind like a OG
I got 12 diamond chains like a OZ
Follow me like the Wizard of Oz
Girls love my style cause it is so neat
Ask about me in the streets I spit so heat
Ain’t nobody in the game messing with my clique
Style swift hot like it’s July 10th
Fly chick in my whip with nice tits
Her boyfriend paid for it, I didn’t
Ice game, cold as a polar bear
Sun hit my chain, watch it make a solar flare
We gettin' money over here hands in the air
Y'all making it too easy, it’s not fair

I wake up early in the morning 'round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like what's up? (Say what's up?)
And I’m all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer-bammer-bammer

I remember back in the days, man, I was broke
These days Soulja Tell 'Em run a hundred spokes
No joke, mayne I’m balling out the atmosphere
Say you ball harder then me, man get 'em outta here
I gotta my speakers going ham in my Lamborghini
Two door coupe, girl in bikini
Passenger seat and she five star she so swag
She so Fabolous, they way she throw it in the bag
Its young soulja soulja mayne I swear I’m popping tags
Back then, you could catch me in a Pontiac
These days drop top Phantom with a 100 stacks
Yeah they buy this album but they want they money back
Girls wet like they living in a fish tank
I’m getting money man what the fuck a bitch think
Young Soulja got my speakers going MC Hammer
Like Rick Ross bitch I think I’m MC Hammer

I wake up early in the morning 'round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like what's up? (Say what's up?)
And I’m all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer-bammer-bammer

32 ContributorsNew Drip Lyrics
(Yeah) Young Drako
Soulja, you already know, nigga
(Baow, baow, baow, baow, baow, baow) Yeah
Blood (Yeah), grrt

I got that new drip
Shooter pop out with the pool stick
F&N, Draco, extended .30 and it sittin' on my hip
Thirty-five thousand for the brand new Rollie, wrist
Bust down my wrist, I flex like Wrestlemania
I just might go to take the jet to Australia
Young Drako, nigga know I’m international
Pull up and serve a pint, know that I'm taxin' them

Hop in Bugatti, push it to the maximum
Young Drako, nigga I’m drippin' blood just like Dracula
In the kitchen, in the trap with a spatula
Whippin' up dope, it's looking spectacular
Bitch in London fell in love with vernacular
Count a hundred fifty K, smoking dope, watching cameras
I'm sippin' codeine and smoking on cannabis
Jump on a private jet and now I'm trappin'

I got that new drip
Shooter pop out with the pool stick
FNN, Draco, extended .30 and it sittin’ on my hip
Thirty-five thousand for the brand new Rollie, wrist
Bust down my wrist, I flex like Wrestlemania
I just might go to take the jet to Australia
Young Drako, nigga know I’m international
Pull up and serve a pint, know that I'm taxin’ them

Balenci' my feet, I put it together
Young Drako, nigga I trap any weather
He made the wrong move, you already know I'ma kill him
Slide in that Bentley, they think I'm drug dealing
Young Drako, nigga you know I’m that nigga
I pop out the cut with my finger on triggers
Flex on that nigga, I made a quarter million
Slide through the city, a matte black Bentley
Black Murci'  like Batman
Stand in the kitchen, I beat up the pack, man
Young Drako, nigga I trap with a strap, man
Pinky ring sittin' on my wrist cost a black Jag'
Nigga, we drop them bombs just like Baghdad (Boom!)
We shootin' first, nigga no we don't clap back
Walk in the VIP, broke nigga back-back
I got a hundred and fifty thousand in my backpack
Smoking on backwoods, rolling up dope, serving good crack
Serving the junkies and fucking the hoodrats
Come to your zone and you know the way I took that
Nigga fell off, ain't shoot back
Eliantte got me shining for real
Run up on Drako, get popped like a pill
Make the wrong move, boy this shit could get real
I went and dropped a ticket on my ear
Pour up a pint, I'm sippin' lean not beer
Pull up on plug, then I disappear
VVS diamond, they looking so clear
Bust down my Rollie, it's looking like burr
A hundred fifty thousand Richard Mille
Zone 1 was signing apartments and trap with the steel
I cannot stop 'til I get a billion
Stupid ass mansion with racks to the ceiling

I got that new drip
Shooter pop out with the pool stick
FNN, Draco, extended .30 and it sittin' on my hip
Thirty-five thousand for the brand new Rollie, wrist
Bust down my wrist, I flex like Wrestlemania
I just might go to take the jet to Australia
Young Drako, nigga know I'm international
Pull up and serve a pint, know that I'm taxin' them

Just Bone and Biggie, Biggie
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie (Rock the party, party)
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie (Better run and tell everybody)
Just Bone and Biggie, Biggie
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie (Everybody, everybody)
Let's ride, let's ride, Let's ride, let's ride
Get high, get high, get high, c'mon
Let's ride, let's ride, Let's ride, let's ride
Get high, get high, get high, c'mon, c'mon

Armed and dangerous
Ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious
Thug-ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryna win, tryin' not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you know who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like niggas move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo' game, talk yo' shit
Grab yo' gat, call yo' clique
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you gonna do: fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga, die slowly
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
"Cash Rule Everything Around Me"
Shit, lyrically niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke, cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer: me or you?

We forgive you, for you know not what you do

7 a.m. woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No-Doz so pop a couple of those
Lil' RIPsta, nigga Mista Clean, make it gleam
Deep in my temple and not to get sentimentally steamed
With my instrumelody, and heated, especially for your team
And a .45 indeed will beam
In between the scenes, destroy your dreams
You willin' to die? We'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene?
We mean mug, Mo' Thugs, trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue of a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, bitch, breakin' out for lies
My Messiah's better get ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender; never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen in my hand
One of my trusted friend-friends
Hey, open the last seal for real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin: baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'
In daily recruitin', there's a thug born everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little, we give 'em a bible
And a pen and a pad to hit the label—kick it, nigga!

Nigga roll with Bone up into the dank spot
To the dome with a shot of burb
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, give me that Mossberg swerve!
Up into my bag 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12 gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off, nigga, y'all loss
Take it all off, got a nigga caught off
For the pump now Leatherface, sin runnin' thuggin' and cuttin'
Little Mo Hart want to pull it ain't nothin'
Bitch if you steppin' we buckin' them guns that’s fucked up
Now let me get down for the grind
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get down for the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be servin' them dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down
If he come back talkin' like, "Give me back me money!"
Thuggin' with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now who ready to get bent?
Nigga like me fiendin' for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money
So I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke

It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie (We gon' rock the party)
Just Bone and Biggie, Biggie
It's Bone and Biggie, Biggie (Rock the party, party)

Get high, get high, get high, c'mon, c'mon

Yeah, Little Lay, hey, comin' in the form of scripture
Finna get ya and hit ya with magic
Droppin' down lead but I call it my gadgets
With an automatic status, we spray
Time to load the Glocks, but I'm thinkin' not
There's another evil force tellin' me to do what I gotta do
So I up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
Biggie, blue's on my ass
Now I pull out the cellular phone to call Bone, "What's happenin'?"
Grab artillery, a nigga start packin'
'Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin'
And I did him, hit him right between the eyes
The spot was wise; wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
Y'all get mo murdered all day, all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'ma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all niggas wanna have a little fun with number one, one, one?
Bloody red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum
Bloody red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum

Spark these bitches interest
Sex is all I expect
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know
They know, quarter past 4
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'
Except how I'm gettin home tomorrow
Cease will drop you off when he see his P.O (Hey)
Back of my mind I hope she swallow
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Griffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, "You know what you do to me"
She starts off, "Well I don't usually" (*Let's go*)
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South (Ow)
I threw that back out, in the parking lot
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top
And I don't stop until I squirt
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked - it all work

===== The Notorious B.I.G. - Gimme the Loot =====
223 ContributorsTranslationsРусскийMagyarGimme the Loot Lyrics
Yeah, motherfuckers better know
Huh, huh (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls
Huh, yeah
(I'm a bad, bad, bad)

My man Inf left a TEC and a nine at my crib
Turned him self in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G, you with me?
Motherfuckin' right, my pockets lookin' kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest
No need for that, just grab the fuckin' gat
The first pocket that's fat, the TEC is to his back
Word is bond, I'ma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (What?)
Treat it like boxin', stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin' motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogard
Have his mother singin', "It's so hard"
Yes, love, love your fuckin' attitude
Because the nigga play pussy
That's the nigga that's gettin' screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whippin'
Welts on the neck from the necklace strippin'
Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches, too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're tnangerp
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant
I'm slammin' niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
'Cause mom duke ain't givin' me shit
So for the bread and butter, I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fuckin' angel dust
When I bust my gat, motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?

When he's stickin' you and takin' all of your money

Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)

Big up! Big up! It's a stick up! Stick up!
And I'm shootin' niggas quick if ya hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in ya back and headpiece
The opposite of peace, sendin' mom duke a wreath
You're talkin' to the robbery expert
Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over bein' resistant
'Cause when I lick shots them shits is persistent
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug
Three fifty-seven slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip, (Yeah, nigga, peel!)
Before you find out how blue steel feel
From the Beretta, puttin' all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckers know the pedi'
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm diggin' in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it
Man, niggas come through, I'm takin' high school rings too
Bitches get delgnarts for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka
So go get your man, bitch, he can get robbed, too
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it, the cocksucker won't forget it

Hey bitch, hey bitch, gimme your money bitch (When he's stickin' you and takin' all your money)

Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)

Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
(What's mines is mines and what's yours is mine)

Man listen, all this walkin' is hurtin' my feet
Ooh, money looks sweet
Where at? In the Isuzu Jeep
Man, I throw him in the fiend you grab the fucking cream
And if he start to scream, bom-bom, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she think she a superstar
Ooh, Biggie let me jack her, I'll kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat
Yo, chill, shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked getting shot on the spot
Oh shit, the cops
Be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
So why the fuck he keep looking?
I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see Central Booking
Oh shit, now he looking in my face
You better haul ass 'cause I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, 'cause I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucker going out for the loot

Take that motherfuckers

===== The Notorious B.I.G. - Ten Crack Commandments =====
209 ContributorsTen Crack Commandments Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

It's the ten crack commandments, what?
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, for my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Nombre Uno: never let no one know
How much dough you hold 'cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number Two: never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know bad boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness (Uh-huh)
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number Three: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number Four: I know you heard this before
"Never get high on your own supply"
Number Five: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want an ounce, tell 'em, "Bounce!"
Number Six: that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back? Shit, forget it
Seven: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number Eight: never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number Nine shoulda been Number One to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged, stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin', they ain't tryna listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number Ten: a strong word called 'consignment'
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say, "Hell no!"
'Cause they gon' want they money rain, sleet, hail, snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, twenty-four years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up
Heard in three weeks, she sniffed a whole half a cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go, gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up (Uh)

Who the fuck is this, pagin' me at 5:46 in the morning?
Crack of dawn and now I'm yawnin'
Wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this pagin' me and why
It's my nigga, Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down, love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?
Yeah, my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah, them my niggas, nah, love, wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some niggas that you knew from back when
When you was clockin' minor figures
Now they heard you're blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warnin' me, 'cause now I'm warnin' you
I got the MAC, nigga, tell me what you gonna do

Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib
You bought your moms out in Florida, the Fifth Corridor
Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singin' and flower-bringin'
If my burglar alarm starts ringin'
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed 'em gunpowder so they can devour
The criminals tryin' to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament
Where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck what I'ma hit you with, you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket, he had a gun, he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on your asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more, nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa come for you?
I'm not runnin', nigga, I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody comin'

C'mon, motherfucker
Man, I'm comin' as fast as I can
Just g— bring your motherfuckin' ass on, come on
Are we gettin' close, huh?
It's right over here
You sure it's Biggie Smalls crib, man?
Yeah, I'm sure, motherfucker, come on
Man, fuck, this better be his motherfuckin' house
Fuck, right here
Tsk, this better be this motherfucker's house
Oh shit
What? What's wrong?
What's that red dot on your head, man?
What red dot?
Oh shit! You got a red dot on your head, too
Oh shit!

===== The Notorious B.I.G. - Sky's the Limit =====
151 ContributorsSky’s The Limit Lyrics
Baby, look at me
Mama love you
And I know you ain't no little boy no more
But you'll always be my baby
It seems like only yesterday I was holding you in my arms
Now look at you now, Biggie
But I worry about you
I worry about you all the time
Hangin' out on the corner
All times at night with the cruel people
Baby, that ain't nothin' but trouble
I always taught you that you could have whatever you dream
Well, I want you to hold onto that dream, baby
Hold on to it real tight, 'cause the sky's the limit

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin' tonight? (Alright)
I'd like to welcome to the stage (Alright, alright)
The lyrically acclaimed, ha (Woo)
I like this young man, because when he came out (Hahahaha)
He came out with the phrase:
He went from ashy to classy — haha, I like that (Alright, alright)
So everybody in the house give a warm
(Uh) Round of applause for The Notorious
B.I.G, ha
The Notorious B.I.G, ladies and gentlemen
Give it up for him, y'all

Uh
A nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
When I was young, I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pinstripes and the gray
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewin' tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You wanna see the inside? Huh, I see ya later
Here comes the drama
"Oh, that's that nigga with the fake"
Blaow! "Why you punch me in my face?" Stay in your place
Play your position (Uh), here come my intuition (Uh-huh)
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with 'em, stole with 'em
I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies — butter crunch
'88 Oshkosh and blue and white dunks, pass the blunt

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on (Gotta keep pressin' on)
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
(Gotta keep movin', gotta keep pressin' on)
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on (Gotta keep pressin' on)
Just keep on pressin' on (Gotta keep pressin' on)
Sky is the limit and you know that you can (Oh-ooh)
Have what you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want (Oh woah, oh yeah)

I was ashamed, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of 'em
Long as I got stuff from most of 'em
It's on, even when I was wrong, I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fuckin', bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in crack, gun packin'
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class to Inglés, pass off and global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Gettin' larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Your brain was a terrible thing to waste
'88 on Gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs with niggas, real-life beginner killers
Prayin' God forgive us for being sinners, help us out

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on (Ooh baby)
Just keep on pressin' on (Gotta keep pressin' on)
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
(Gotta keep movin', gotta keep pressin' on)
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on (Ohh, gotta keep pressin' on)
Just keep on pressin' on (Gotta keep pressin' on)
Sky is the limit and you know that you can (Yeah, ooh)
Have what you want, be what you want (Woah ooh, yeah)
Have what you want, be what you want (Oh, woah, yes)

After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have to be in school by ten, I then
Begin to encounter with my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart
Break it down into sections, drugs by the selections
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold separately, Frank the Deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustler's Prayer:
"If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand"
Put money in my mom's hand
Get my daughter this college plan so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid, only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase "Sky's the limit"
Motherfucker, see you chumps on top

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on (Oh oh)
Just keep on pressin' on (Gotta keep pressin' on)
Sky is the limit and you know that you can (Gotta keep movin' on)
Have what you want, be what you want (Gotta keep pressin' on, baby)
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on (Oh, oh, every day)
Just keep on pressin' on (We'll be alright)
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
(Keep on movin', keep on pressin' on)
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on (Gotta keep pressin' on)
Just keep on pressin' on (Gotta keep pressin' on)
Sky is the limit and you know that you can (Every day will be alright)
Have what you want, be what you want (If you will, oh)
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on (Oh, gotta keep pressin' on)
Just keep on pressin' on (Gotta keep pressin' on)
Sky is the limit and you know that you can
Have what you want, be what you want
(Everything will be alright if you will keep on pressin' on)
(Gotta keep pressin' on)
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on (Gotta keep pressin' on)
Sky is the limit and you know that you can (Gotta keep pressin' on)
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on (Oh, woah, ooh)
Just keep on pressin' on

===== The Notorious B.I.G. - Machine Gun Funk =====
142 ContributorsMachine Gun Funk Lyrics
Yeah

So you wanna be hardcore?
With your hat to the back, talkin' 'bout the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcore
Appeal that you're screamin', maybe I'm dreamin'
This ain't Christopher Williams
Still some MCs gotta feel one, caps I got to peel some
To let niggas know! (Let 'em know)
That if you fuck with Big and Heavy, I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me! The lyrical
Niggas sayin', "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me!
Just for niggas actin' shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smokin' funk by the boxes, packin' Glocks-es
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, baby!

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

All I want is bitches! Big booty bitches!
Used to sell crack so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitches
From stayin' in my business, what is this relentless
Approach to know if I'm broke or not?
Just 'cause I joke and smoke a lot, don't mean I don't tote the Glock
16 shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfuckin' meet again
Huh! I'm doin' rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the Ave., I'm real hard to find now
'Cause I'm knee deep in the beats
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the ****
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head 'cause when you hit the bricks
I got gin, mad blunts and bitches suckin' dick
The funk, baby!

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk (Uh)
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

So I guess you know the story — the rap side, crack side
How I smoke funk, smack bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy! The place where my head rests
Fifty-shot clip if a nigga wan' test
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfuckin' helicopter
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdemeanor
Beatin' motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
"What's love got to do..."
When I'm rippin' all through your whole crew?
Strapped like Bamboo, but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's sellin' by the tons
Niggas wanna know how I live the mack life!
Makin' money, smokin' mics like crack pipes!
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
The funk, baby!

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

29 ContributorsHold Ya Head Lyrics
Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion

Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' Buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
You see, it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Ramo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

I reach my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'

Astro, yeah

Sun is down, freezin' cold
That's how we already know, winter's here
My dawg would probably do it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know, he don't know nothin' else
I tried to show 'em, yeah
I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' on you with the pick and roll
Young La Flame, he in sicko mode

(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Some-some-some-someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-play-playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-play-playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak

Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, "Hop in, you comin' too"
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, "Where we goin'?" I said, "The moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

Someone said
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Play-playin' for keeps
Someone said, mother****, someone said
Don't play us for weak


Yeah

Got me goin' crazy (It's lit)
On tour, we'll tell 'em, we brought the section (Gang)
They keep on callin' up, it's getting hectic (Brrt)
Like we projected
So we cut the plug, he's interjected (Got me goin' crazy)

Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (Yeah)
Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby (It's lit)
Whatever I downed, it got me goin' crazy (Yah)
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (Alright)

I was hot as hell out in the heat (Yeah, yeah)
Then the storm came in and saved my life
Head up to the sky, down on my knees (Straight up)
Out of nowhere, you came here to save the night
In the nighttime (Woo, yeah)
Got me goin' crazy

Okay, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past, you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dawgs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, that's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds (Alright, alright, alright)
And she hit that booger sugar 'til her nose bleed (Alright, alright, alright)
Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever, got a whole week (Alright, alright, alright)
Plus, she know my baby mama is a trophy
She be throwin' up them B's, feel like we both bleed
She keep my dick jumpin' up, feel like I'm Moby
I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe, yeah
This right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
They keep itchin' at my spirit, I'm diabolical, you feel me?

No, you can't say if I'm mad or not
Smokin' hella weed, I'm on that alcohol
And shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off
I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turnin' out
What would you do if you heard I got it goin' on?
I had to burn, I left skrrt marks, I had to dip (I had to)
Gotta watch for 12 'round my town, you might get killed (Better watch for 12)
I'm out my mind, yeah, I'm high above the rim (I'm out my mind)
You cop it live, boy, I got it all on film

You gotta watch out where you rock 'cause shit get real
Drink too real, I can't be fake, don't know the feel
Gotta take a long drive up the hill
Gang too wavy, move like Navy Seals
I'm too wavy, think I need a Lyft
Chicago baby, she just wanna drill
The vibe's too wavy, it's too hard to kill
Gotta watch out where you go 'cause shit get real

Uh-huh, yeah
Swang, when I swang, when I swang to the left
Oh, yeah
Po—pop my trunk, dip—dip—dip—dip

You can't say if I'm mad or nah
Smokin' hella weed, I'm on that alcohol
And shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off
I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turnin' out
What would you do if you heard I got it burnin' out?
I let it burn, skrrt that mark, I had to dip (I had to)
Better watch for 12 'round my town, you might get killed (Better watch for 12)
I'm out my mind, yeah, I'm high above the rim (I'm out my mind)
You cop it live, boy, I got it all on film

You must be cautious, told the lil' hoes, "I'm all in"
Play this ballers offense, I left ol' girl, she callin'
You know I hit in the mornin', oh, yeah, she yawnin'
I met you in the club, bitch, you know this shit mean nothin'
Oh, didn't I hit your cousin? Mmm, no, no discussion
Sippin' on lean, no Robitussin, oh, yeah, I know you love me

I don't give a fuck how hard it get, that lil' bitch know I started this
Uh-huh, oh, yeah, get to the cash, no layup
Spend a big bag, Rodeo, some may ride for the fresh cut
Hoes come through just to touch us, I'ma tell the truth like Usher

Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check (Check)
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest (Drip)
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex (Checks)
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed (Shine)
Two-tone Patek (Mmm-mmm-mmm)
In The Clearport like I Uber these jets (Jets)
VVSs on me, got my Gucci shirt wet
Put an M in my bag (Mmm), gon' get used to these racks (Used)
I went to school where they teach you finesse (Mmm)
Five hundred shoes for the drip, I invest ('Vest, mmm)
I'm the bossman, I keep cash in the desk (Mmm-mmm-mmm)
Know the coupe fast (Yeah), when it end with an "S"

Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number 4s
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watchin' my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said, "I'll be there in ten," but I got there in four

I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold (Gold, gold, gold)
Mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm-hmm-mmm

She a porn star girl, ah, from the valley

Who left her hometown world all for that alley
Ooh, created Lake Tahoe all from her panties

Ooh, used to take the long way home
Long way home, all for that candy (Hahahahaha, mhm)

Baby's hooked on feeling low-ow
Do, do, do
Do, do

Jacques turned La Flame, now he rollin' on an Addy
Fifty on a chain, 'nother fifty on a Caddy
Ooh, he might pop him a pill, pop him a seal
Pop anyone, pop anything
Pop anything to find that alley
Mhm, yeah, to find that alley (Mhm)

Baby's hooked on feeling low-ow
Do, do, do

Holy Father, come save these niggas, I'm stylin' on 'em
Good Lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses

When I stare in your eyes
You'll be there forever
To watch our life (To watch our life together)
You just like going to Heaven (My heart)
More than anything (Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
I'm fallin' and I'm drownin'
But you're takin' me

One thousand on my feet, stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (Eyes)

Rollie Pollie on my wrist
Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' no FaceTime
50K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
Emboldened by the bliss
I was sworn in by a kiss
Latе from the country caters
No peacеmaker, I sweep up cases
Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
Cupid creep in, sleep with a hammer
Three time to get me T-T-T'd
Still same phone, AT&T-T
Still givin' news very vividly
Beefin' up, fuck a beef
Smokin' on some vicious type of reefer
I need no beef, no cheese (Yeah)
Even when I eat, they cheat (Uh)
Every time we meet, naive

When I stare in your eyes
You'll be there forever
To watch our life (To watch our life together)
You just like going to Heav— (My heart)

One thousand on my feet, stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (Eyes)

Yeah, it's mad how it gets so deep
It's mad how I get so high
It's mad how you get me by (By)

Tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me, it's me

Look in my eyes, tell me your tale
Do you see the road, the map to my soul?
Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
Am I picture-perfect or do I look fried?
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
Tell you demise, I went to my side
To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings, I had to decide
I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a city of people that ride wit' me
If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child
The things I created became the most weighted, I gotta find balance and keep me a smile (Hah)
Yeah, yeah
That shit wild, instead I'm a hero
I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain
I run it for miles, this shit wasn't luck
They got me fucked up, I put you on bus and take you around
A couple of guys inside of the school, I gave 'em the tools to get it off ground
They say they the ones when they make the errors
Can't look in the mirror (That shit wild)
I stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage
No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it
We do in the streets, we do it for keeps
We do it for rights, got fifty-two weeks
This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak
This shit is forever and infinity
Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
I take me a bean and I turn to a beast
Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat
If I gave you a day in my life or a day in my eyes, don't blink

Used to wanna fuck an R&B bitch, then that shit happened (Yeah, yeah, Pluto)
Used to wanna be rich, then it finally happened
Thought it'd make me happy (Thought it'd make me happy)

I could've took the pain and I could've went out sad
Streets stepped in and raised me, but I ain't have my daddy
Niggas tryna clone me, run off with my swag
From sellin' coco, got Chanel on my jacket (Jacket)
Shawty give me mop with the less, it don't last (Last)
Takin' more drugs all alone in a mansion (All alone)
Walkin' around tweakin' with the yop in my hands (Walkin' around tweakin')
Just another broke ho just prеachin' for these bands (Just another ho)
And I know I'm duе for a billion-dollar advance (Uh-huh)

I can see the future, I can see the future (I can see the future)
I can see the future, it's lookin' like we leveled through the sky
I can't wait to live in glory in eternal lastin' life (Livin' in glory)
Won't you take the wheel? And I recline and I sit still
Might as well turn up now, He gon' pop up unannounced
To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds? (Like the way it sound)

You know the future of the bounce, ayy
I can hear your thoughts so loud, I can hear the crowd so loud
Do you like the way it sounds? Ayy
I can hear your thoughts so loud, I can hear the crowd so loud (So loud), loud

I can see the future
Ride with Wolf and Storm' and some troopers
Ridin' through this shit, this shit is stupid, uh
Sky walkin' 'round like I'm Luke-uh
Duckin' all these convos like I'm Bruce-uh, super
Mobbin' with my angels dodgin' Lucifer (Mob)
Seein' every angle, I can see through ya, yeah (Yeah)

I can see the future, it's lookin' like we leveled through the sky (See enough)
I can't wait to live in glory in eternal lastin' life (Livin' in glory)
Won't you take the wheel? And (See enough) I recline and I sit still
Might as well turn up now, He gon' pop up unannounced
To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds?
You know the future of the bounce

Count so much money 'til my skin peel
Cherry-red Benz like the real pimp (Yeah)
My bro cook up dope, it take real skill
Share my bitch with my ho, ain't got no chill (No)
You either gettin' to money or you're gossipin' (Yeah)
She chose up, put on this coat, now she lottery

Places I thought I'd never go I fly models in
I hear the demons clear when they callin' (Yeah)
Flyest on the Earth, so I had to name myself a planet (Pluto)
Automatic dead when you goin' against my family
Few breakups went public, I just bought another baddie (Bought another baddie)
Bitch knew I was toxic, when she met me, I was a savage (Met me, I was a savage)
High in the hills tryna avoid any madness (Yeah)
Private on the Lear, this just like we imagined
Only settlin' for this Hi-Tech 'cause I ain't got the Actavis (Yeah)
I'm tryna be modest (Ah), it sound like I'm braggin' (Braggin')
Cartier my frames (Frames), all because my fame (Fame)
Bitch said she ashamed to love me in public, rather go private (See enough)

Count so much money 'til my skin peel
Cherry-red Benz like the real pimp
My bro cook up dope, it take real skill
Share my bitch with my ho, ain't got no chill
You either gettin' to money or you're gossipin'
She chose up, put on this coat, now she lottery

I can see the future, it's lookin' like we leveled through the sky
I can't wait to live in glory in eternal lastin' life
Won't you take the wheel? And I recline and I sit still
Might as well turn up now, He gon' pop up unannounced
To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds?

I can't get enough, told you I just want it all
I can't get enough, you ain't been doin' enough (Do you like the way it sounds?)
So cold, so cold
It's so cold, so cold, so cold

You could see the future, there's a sparkle in your eye
Why you all up on my thigh? Can't let you
Niggas plottin' my demise, I got murder on my mind
I got money on the line, I can't lose if I tried
Let no bitch break my stride
Chosen, I'm gon' bet on me
Chosen, all my shit antique
Frozen, I can't feel no heat
Diamonds dancing on me
You startin' fresh, man, you fell out of pocket
You fucked that girl that you met at the party
I got some new niggas down in the lobby
How can I sleep when you're out catchin' bodies?
I still wanna be with you, trust me, I know that's insane
I'd rather fuck on you than fuck on lames
I did some shit in Berlin, I'm OD
We both ain't shit and it's workin' for me
Workin' for me, yeah
I can see the future, I can see the future

I just poured an eight in a liter
Throw some Jolly Rancher in, make it sweeter
Versace my clothes, I'm with a white ho
And she snortin' three lines like Adidas
Got a black girl rollin' off molly
Got a white bitch snortin' up snow
Say she want real niggas in the party
Parents gon' leave the keys to the condo

Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose (That coca)

Bitch, close the door, there's shit on your nose

Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed (Yeah)

Louder (Louder)
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher (Uh, yeah)
It's like standing in the ocean
We just rocked Coachella, I gave her half of the check
It was good sex, honorable mention to the neck
(Just let this wash on me)
Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex (In the memory, standing in the ocean)
If you take a girl out, do you expect sex?
If she take her titties out, do you expect checks?
First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace (Just let this wash on me)
Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked (Feels like slow motion)
Took a church visit, you know, 'cause the world hectic

It's like floating, if I can't be in time
I don't know, I don't know (Wash on me, wash on me, yeah)
In the ocean, if I can't be loved
I don't know a sound
(That's right)

Standing in the ocean (Standing in the ocean)
Just let this wash on me (Ooh)
Bad memories like waves
Echoing (Echoing), echoing
Standing in the ocean (Oh, baby)
Standing in the ocean
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed

Tensions is definitely rising
T'd up right now
T time, T time
T time, T time, T time

Teatime like I got a cup of this shit
Tee time like golf at a quarter to six
I love to fuck on a regular bitch
Famous hoes lame, but they stay on my dick
Heard your new joint, it's embarrassing, shit
You talk to the cops on some therapist shit
You act like you love this American shit
But, really, the truth is you scared of the 6
Yeah, you scared of the 6
Yeah, you scared of the 6
Your bodyguard put in some work on a fluke
Now you wanna go and inherit that shit
Don't talk to the boy 'bout comparisons, shit
Or come to the boy on some arrogant shit
The weapons we got are some terrorist shit
Like TV producers we, grr, we airing this shit
She askin' for bread for her parents and shit
I told her I don't got no cash and she said she could wait on a rack, on some Arabic shit
I pull out a million and stare at the shit
My dick just got hard 'cause a wire just hit
My schedule is out, come spin us, for real
Man, fuck all that spinnin' the narrative shit
I melt down the chains that I bought from yo' boss
Give a fuck about all of that heritage shit
Since V not around, the members done hung up the Louis, they not even wearing that shit
Don't come to the boy 'bout repairing some shit
Don't come to the boy about sparing some shit
You lucky that Vogue was suing 'cause I would've been with the Wassas in Paris and shit

Is you fuckin' crazy? Is you fuckin' crazy? (Ah)
And they scared of the seven (Seven)
After one-three then we turn up eleven (Yeah)
Keep this shit open like 7-Eleven (It's lit)
Me at the house, I got seven in heaven
They think I'm satanic, I keep me a reverend
Lil' shawty a therapist (Yeah), poppin' her shit
She inching my way then she started confessing
I know what's at stake, I'm screamin', "Free Jeffery"
Connect collect calls right off of the celly
Gave her the blues, not talkin' 'bout belly
Don't keep it sincere, I go Makaveli
I got the juice, now it's heavy (Juice)
Always on t-time, been ready (T, ah), yeah
Is you fucking crazy? Is you f— (Yeah, stoned, let's go)
Wrappin' the cheese, wrap around me 'cause I've got property (Wrap, cheese, wrap)
Chocolate AP and chocolate the Vs (Vs), got the Willy Wonka factory (Vs)
Burn a athlete like it's calories, find another flame hot as me, bitch

Is you fucking crazy? Yeah

Swanging in the pickup truck, baby, fuck Mercedes (Fuck Mercedes)
I'll fuck a nigga bitch but she can't have the baby (Have the baby)
I'll shoot your ass in Walmart like I'm DaBaby (In Walmart)
The boy going Lionel Messi, I go Tom Brady (Woo)
Used to wear the bust down back in my old days (Woo)
Now I let the chains hang, you gotta tuck yours maybe (Tuck it, tuck it)

California love

California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a

California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (Yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

South Central
Uh, that's right
Now make it shake

Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

Shake it, Cali
Uh, uh, West Coast
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house
Uh, yeah, Oaktown
Oakland definitely in the house
Frisco, Frisco

And you know L.A. up in here
Pasadena, where you at?
Yeah, Inglewood
Inglewood always up to no good
Even Hollywood tryin' to get a piece, baby
Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?
Throw it up, y'all! Throw it up, throw it up!
I can't see ya
Let's show these fools how we do it over on this Westside
'Cause you and I know it's the best side
Yeah, that's right

Y'all know how this shit go (You know)
All eyes on me
Motherfuckin' OG
Roll up in the club and shit, is that right?
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
But you know what?

I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where those cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player 'cause even when I'm high
Fuck with me and get crossed later, the future's in my eyes
'cause all I want is cash and things
A five-double-0 Benz, flauntin' flashy rings, uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches and bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got foe niggas and low riders in ski masks
Screamin', "Thug Life!" every time they pass, all eyes on me

Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player (All eyes on me) 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high

Hey, to my nigga Pac

So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' every day, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Mediocres got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks
Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
My little homie G, can't you see I'm buster-free?
Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me

Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me

The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket
Get your money, motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it
All eyes on me

Live the life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life as a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me

Pay attention, my niggas! See how that shit go?
Nigga walk up in this motherfucker and it be like, "Bing!"
Cops, bitches, every-motherfuckin'-body

He he he, it's like what they think

===== 2Pac - Changes =====
336 ContributorsTranslationsالعربيةFrançaisРусскийPortuguêsChanges Lyrics
Ooh, yeah (Ooh)
(Come on, come on)

I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
"Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare"
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
"It's time to fight back," that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? Uh
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is

(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah-yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Come on, come on)
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other (Kill each other)
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president, uh (Oh-ooh)
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change (Never change)
Try to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)
You gotta operate the easy way
"I made a G today," but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), "I gotta get paid" (Oh)
Well hey, well that's the way it is

(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Aww, yeah, aww, yeah)

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
"Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat," that's the way it is

(Uh)
That's just the way it is (Just the way it is, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Things'll never be the same (Yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is)
Aww, yeah (Some things will never change, oh my)
(I'm tryna make a change)
(You're my brother, you're my sister, yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same (You're my brother, you're my sister)
That's just the way it is, aww, yeah
Some things'll never change

I should've seen you was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began, we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems, but we workin' at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand if you could see
I never planned to be your man, it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I opened up the door with your jealous questions
Like, where can I be? You're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucker for love

What you won't do, do for love? (That's right, sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Sucker for love)
What you won't do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy, you tried to trap me
Said you're pregnant and guess who the daddy? Don't wanna fall for it
But in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin' promises to you, tryna keep it true
What if I'm wrong? A trick to keep me holdin' on
Tryna be strong and in the process, keep it goin'
I'm 'bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head, I'm feelin' low, losin' control
My heart is sayin', "Leave!" Oh, what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear, 'cause I'm leavin', I'm out the door
Never no more you will see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you've been cheatin', I'm a sucker for love
What you won't do, do for love? (Sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Don't, sucker for love)
What you won't do, do for love? (Oh, yeah, sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Oh, baby)

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hopin' the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you, a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry 'bout it, we can do it now, I'm under pressure
Make a decision 'cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery
Replace it with happiness but I need your faith in me, I'm a sucker for love

What you won't do, do for love? (What you won't do for love, sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (That ain't right, I'm a sucker for love)
What you won't do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don't give up (No)

What you won't do, do for love? (Sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Sucker for love)
What you won't do, do for love? (Sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up (Sucker for love)
What you won't do? (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do? (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Do for love, yeah, baby, yeah
Do for love

===== 2Pac - Dear Mama =====
229 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsDeutschFrançais2Pac - Dear Mama (الترجمة العربية)TürkçeDear Mama Lyrics
You are appreciated

When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman, it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)
Lady, lady

===== 2Pac - Keep Ya Head Up =====
263 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoEnglishKeep Ya Head Up Lyrics
Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots (Oh)
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care (Oh)
And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But, huh, please, you got to keep your head up

In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?

Ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this

Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us, aight?

A toast to the gangsters

Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bombin' hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N, double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs
Sure enough, I keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin' on the outcome
"Free 2Pac" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seem they tryna take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit
So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases (Hm)
Bitches, get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down (Biatch)
Uh, me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage, I've got
Nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish
I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerino
I've got a house out in the hills, right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal, uh
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the ki's, motherfucker
Now, follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how can they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it

Now give me fifty feet, defeat is not my destiny
Release me to the streets and keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers, who can fade the thug?
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
It's like, Cuh, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have paper in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turn gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kid
They tell me not to roll with my Glock, so now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Baitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryna get up on it

===== 2Pac - Ghetto Gospel =====

Uh, hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days (Days)
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays, things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth, 'cause the truth look strange
And for me, it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts (Hurts)
‘Cause any day, they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined
My ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me (Ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

Tell me, do you see that old lady, ain't it sad?
Livin' out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady
Crack got her crazy, guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan, we jump into another form of slavery
Even now, I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles (Own bottles)
I make mistakes, but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
But am I less holy
'Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me (Yeah, ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

Lord, can you hear me speak?
To pay the price of bein' hellbound

'Round and 'round (Aw yeah)
'Round and 'round, 'round we go (I get around)
'Round and 'round
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
(Step up, step-step up, step up)
'Round and 'round, 'round we go (stronger than ever)
'Round and 'round

Back to get wrecked, all respect
To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
‘Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me—lady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying "Bye-bye"
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask "Why?", don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
When will ya learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out: I get around

What you mean you don't know?
Round and round, around we go
I get around, the Underground just don't stop for hoes
Round and round
I get around, still down with the Underground
Round and round, around we go
I get around, yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know
Round and round

Now you can tell from my everyday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (Tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Tryna make a dollar out of 15 cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby, I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me; I get around

What's up, love? How you doin'? (All right)
Well, I've been hangin', sangin' tryna do my thang, oh, you heard that I was bangin'
Your homegirl you went to school with? That's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't (Uhh)
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low, long as you know that I get around

'Round and 'round, around we go
2Pacalypse Now don't stop for hoes, I get around
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round, around we go
Why I ain't call you? Hahahah, please!
'Round and 'round

Fingertips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships
It's a trip, I love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin'
Put a little twist in her hips ‘cause I'm watchin'
Conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone, why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Somethin' is on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well, if I couldn't have it (Silly rabbit) why you sweatin' me?
It's a lot of real Gs doin' time
'Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?
I get around

How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it yeah?
How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; the Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some more weed, funk, you don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it (Tell me how you want it)

How do you want it? (Yeah-yeah)
How does it feel? (Ooh, Yeah)
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it? (Yeah-yeah)
How do you feel? (Ohh-ohh)
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real (I'm livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real)

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor, it's like erotic
Ironic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get to rockin' these, nights full of Alizé (Alizé)
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame, so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, niggas, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' 'bout us, I could give a fuck
Like we the first ones to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

How do you want it? (Tell me)
How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real (I'm livin' in the, I'm livin' in the-)
How do you want it? (I wanna know how you feel)
How do you feel? (Ooh)
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me (Haha)
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I'm with a clique that's quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
How do you want it?

===== 2Pac - Only God Can Judge Me =====
198 ContributorsTranslationsفارسیOnly God Can Judge Me Lyrics
Only God can judge me (That right?)
Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (Nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (Really)
Only God can judge me now

Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, 'cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use in tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious, 'cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
'Cause the media is full of dirty tricks

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

Flatline
I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
'Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up stranglin', danglin' my bed sheets
I call the nurse 'cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
'Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
"Black Power" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
'Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
That's for real
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know?
Let me live, baby, let me live

Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the realer
For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him, fool, start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin, wearin' a cross
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back, like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, "You can fade him"
Punk, I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin' bullets, representin' the Bay
Pac, when you was locked down, that's when "I'll Be Around"
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin', sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise

Guess you figure you know me, 'cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night clubs, drink them Buds
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm 'bout to floss some boss player shit with 4-Tay

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

Only God man
That right?
That's real
Hahahahahaha
Fuck everybody else, you know what I'm sayin'?
Man, look here, man
My only fear of death
Is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated, man
That's for the homie Mental
Hehehehe
We up out

===== 2Pac - Can't C Me =====
147 ContributorsCan’t C Me Lyrics
The blind stares of a million pairs of eyes
Lookin' hard but won't realize
That they will never see the P!
You must be goin' blind

Give me my money in stacks and lace my bitches with dime figures
Real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch 'em while they coked up and weeded
Open fire, now them niggas bleedin'
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown
Straight out the West, don't get blown
My adversaries cry like hoes, open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe? Nigga, you ain't know?
They got me stressed out on Death Row
I've seen money, but baby, I've gots to get mo'
You screamin', "Go 2Pac!" and I ain't stoppin' 'til I'm well-paid
Bail's paid now, nigga, look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens, niggas open fire
Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise, until I die
Ask me why I'm a boss player gettin' high
And when I'm rollin' by niggas can't see me!

The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And you'll never realize
You can't see me

Been gettin' word that these square motherfuckers with nerves
Sayin' they can get with us, but picture me gettin' served
My own mama say I'm thugged out
My shit be poppin' out the record store as if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga, what? It ain't nothin' but a party when we thug
And there I was, a young nigga with heart, ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules
D-R-E, you got me heated; my words like a penitentiary dick
Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed, Alizé and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down: witness me
Bail on these hoes in floss-mode
The life of a boss player, fuck what you thought though
My enemies deceased
Die like a bitch when my album hit the streets; niggas can't see me!

Niggas can't see me
They can't see me
Which way did he go, George?
Which way did he go?
Oh!! Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?

You niggas made a mistake
You should've never put my rhymes with Dre
Them thug niggas have arrived and it's judgement day
Hey homie, if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't kill me
I can make a motherfucker shake, rattle and roll
I'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rappin' bring me money, then I'm rappin' 'til I'm paid
I'm gettin' green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star and visualize my debut
Niggas know me, player, I gotta stay true
Don't be a dumb motherfucker 'cause it's crazy after dark
Where the true thug-niggas see your heart; niggas can't see me!

Yo, check this out: stay off his dick

Niggas can't see me
Right before your eyes, I'll disappear from here
You niggas can't see me
You can't see me
I know it's hard nigga, I'm all up in your face
But you still can't see me
You can't see me
All up in your range, but niggas can't see me
20/20 vision won't visualize
I'm in the flesh, baby, but you can't see me
All those glasses won't help you realize
You blinded, you blinded, you can't see me
You can't see me
Thug Life, baby
Don't believe everything you read! Alizé and weed
You can't see me, right before your very eyes
You won't even visualize, you can't see me
Dr. Dre all day, 2Pac
Niggas can't see me
I dedicate this to you punk motherfuckers!
This one's for you, BIG baby
'Cause you bitch-ass niggas can't see me
Niggas can't see me
You can't see me
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
You won't see me
Yeah, first you see me, now you don't
Wanna see me, but you won't
Come to see me, but you can't
Oh, you can't see me
You can't see me
Right between your eyes and you'll never realize
Right before your eyes, you won't even realize
Visualize what you can't see

Ah, yeah Hahaha (Yeah)
It's all about you, one time (I'ma say it's all about you, baby, yeah)
Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you (It's all about you) (This Dru Down in the house
With my boy 'Pizznac, you know what I'm sayin'?)
It's all about you (Yeah, I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, ha Yeah)

You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh at how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it? (Hell no)
Addicted to the things you do
But still true what I'm sayin', boo, 'cause this is all about you

Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoes (It's all about you)
Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoes

I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?
Creep though, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah, nigga, it's all about you

Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoes
Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoes

Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
(It's all about you)

Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoes
Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoes
Every other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoes
Every other city we go, every other video
No matter where I go, I see the same hoes

I'm tellin' ya, it's the same old shit
I mean, goddamn, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel, I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'? And then, you know what I'm sayin'?
What make that even more fucked up
I'm watchin' a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same ho
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah

===== 2Pac - So Many Tears =====
145 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsSo Many Tears Lyrics
I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please, God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest, tell me, can you feel me?
I'm not livin' in the past, you wanna last?
Be the first to blast, remember Kato
No longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

Ahh, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse, God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, I'll shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers and shed so many tears

Now, I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death, now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin', about to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the Sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come

Lord! (God!) I suffered through the years and shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers and—

Lord knows, I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy, disillusioned lately
I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady, don't trust my lady
'Cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door, shed so many tears (God please help me)

Lord, I lost so many years (I suffered through the years) and shed so many tears
I lost so many peers and shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years and shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers and shed so many tears

Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit' ya, I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean? 'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen' and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a player for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe-to-toe, when it's time to roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up-state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', "Hell, I know one day I'll be back"
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
A true down-ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha

Well, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, (Ohh) but I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
Ha, I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', "Thug 'til I die!" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, 'cause life goes on

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, and life goes on

Yeah nigga, I got the word it's hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball 'til my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug 'til I die!

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, 'cause life goes on

Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

Life goes on, homie
Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel you, nigga, trust me, I feel you
You know what I mean?
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year, nigga, life goes on, we're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Next time you see your niggas, we gon' be on top, nigga

'Pac
Hey
What's happening
Not motherfucking double R, Richie baby
What's happening baby, you know how we do it
Yeah nigga, you know I'm up out this bitch
It's time for me to uhhh regulate
Fo' sho', hey
Observe
And you ain't going back?
Nah nah nah, we got to show these motherfuckers whassup though
This is for the honeys, the superstar
I don't want to be her man, I want to be her nigga
You feel me?
Well let 'em know

You fucking with niggas that's insecure
Watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me 'til you sure
I ain't begging just trying to relocate between your legs
Dripping wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
You straight begging to sex me got you undressing to test me and uhh..

Shut me down if you want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared, go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharing skirts

I'm hoping you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is banging, got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of trying to make my songs pay
Making love all day against the wall in the hallway
Your fantasies come alive, your heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga

I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
('Cause) These busters ain't loving you right

Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see you blushing like you want something
Come get a taste of Amerikaz Most Wanted
And let's get into some touching, erotic fuckin'
My up and down with no interruptions
Have no intentions of busting until you learn your lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
And plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass

You can ride out with sport coat, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
And I'ma listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
That I's the nigga and sport coat can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind
And when I'm on the field keep you on the sidelines

I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right

Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got you naked
Totally sweating, let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissing 'til yo' head swang
I'm so into you, witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know
Now scream my name out; do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss player, freaky motherfucker, can I dig?

It's on and popping, now you see what I was seeing
Why your eyes rolling? Loosen up, girl, I ain't going
Nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stressed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold the boots, and let a nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm going home tonight
You say you don't need a man, but I don't care
You're in the presence of a player, I'd rather be ya nigga

I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
So I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)
(I'd rather be yo' nigga)

Relocate my fantasy

You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now, I don't wanna wake up

Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind (Yeah)

And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (Uh-huh)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again

Is translatin' to another form of, what you call it? (Love)
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I ain't met you, I've been lookin'
Stop the waitin' 'fore I stop the chasin', like a alcoholic
"You don't understand me"  – What the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah, it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar-honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Ugh

Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind

Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window

I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand (Ayy)
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Gone, nigga)
New magic (Woo), new magic, new magic wand

My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'
This 60-40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine

Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)

(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)

I wanna be found, passenger in your car (Don't leave)
You wanna be mean, mixed signals don't park (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)
We can finally be together

You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck? You not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one? Evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote

Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, but the walkin' depends
If you can’t understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
And let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't—
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

I was, I was, I was, I was out here playing games
You was out here with a lame one
(I can play the side nigga role easy, but not for too long)
I'm the, I'm the, I'm the, I’m the side nigga
I gotta sneak around and hide with you
I wanna see you, give me five minutes

So I know that it's fake when I see y'all
Don't wanna fuck what you got up

Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...


I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely-ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
For real, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck

They say the loudest in the room is weak

Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely (Woo)
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony (Woo)
One thing I know is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
My heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start, it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh (Hahaha)

Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla

That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed

Been fillin' it for so long

My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes (Nah)
Like a vasectomy, what have I done? (Ohh)
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (Who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (Who)
The loneliest of them all (Me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet

There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch

No, no, no, no, no, no, listen, listen (Call me when you get lost, lost)
The driver gon' drop you off
Alright, it's warm (Call me when you get lost, lost)
The waterfall is crazy
I don't know, make somethin' up, tell him somethin'
Uh, come on
Still on the boat
Call me if you get lost

You and I, we fell in love
I ain't read the signs, ain't know what it was
But God gotta know he might have peaked when he made you
The cosmos' only mistake is what they named you (What that mean?)

They should call you sugar, you're so sweet
Well, they should call you sugar, 'cause you're so sweet to me
Well, they should call you sugar, sugar, oh, you're so sweet
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest thing I've known

Baby, you're the sweetest thing

Even if
You left me out here stranded, my feelings wouldn't change a bit (You know how I feel about you, are you ready?)
You know how I feel, baby
Infinite
The love I have for you, a diamond couldn't put a dent in it (Uh, go to the bridge thing, okay)

Darling, you're the wind under my wings
My heart beats triple time when I see you
Somethin' I can't control
If I compared you, the sun is a stand-in (Sun)
You got a smile that could light up a planet (Smile), yeah (Oh, oh)
And I just wanted you to know (They should call you sugar)

They should call you sugar, you're so sweet
Well, they should call you sugar (Why?), 'cause you're so sweet to me (Sugar)
Well, they should call you sugar (Sugar), you're so sweet (Oh, oh)
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest thing I've known (Ooh, girl)

You're the sweetest

They should call you sugar, you're so sweet (Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar)
Well, they should call you sugar (Why?), 'cause you're so sweet to me
Well, they should call you sugar, you're so sweet (You're so sweet to me)
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest (I know)

And you look so good (Yeah)
And you smell so good (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you taste so good (Yeah)
And you're so, so good (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're the sweetest (Yeah)
Yeah, you are, ha-ha
Sweet like, like motherfuckin' brown sugar sweet potatoes (Are you ready?)
Or somethin'
Ha-ha

The plan was to stick my toe in and
Check the temperature, but
Next thing I know, I'm
I'm drownin'
Appelle-moi si tu te perds

This here for the sunseekers
Run the track

What makes you think
I'm not in love?
How could you know
What's best for us?
Why am I here
Standing alone?
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance, yeah (Welcome to the disco)

You're so good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, it felt good to me, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah, yeah
You're so good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, it felt so good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

So, what makes you think (What makes you think)
I'm not in love? (I'm not in love?)
And how could you know (How could you know)
What's best for us, us, us? (What's best for us?)
Why am I here (Why am I here)
Standing alone? (Standing alone?)
Because I thought you wanted to dance with me

Honestly, it's all about the timing, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I ain't mean to lead you on, because
Him and I got some things that we're trying
But my energy belongs to you
I want you so bad, but not too fast
It's not your fault, we can't pretend
Because we both in the wrong

So what makes you think
I'm not in love? (Feels so good)
How could you know, know, know
What's best for us?
Why am I here
Standing alone?
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance, yeah (Run the track)
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance
'Cause I thought, I thought you wanted to dance
('Cause I thought you wanted to dance with me) I thought you wanted to dance
('Cause I thought you wanted to dance with me) I thought you wanted to dance
I thought you wanted to dance

I wish that we never met, I wish that we ain't connect
Like Lego, connection good, but mixed signal
If you say so, like cardio
We stared up and down, but we didn't blink
Felt like dirty dishes 'cause we was in sync
I swear to God, if you and him never linked
I'd tear that ass up like somethin' was stole
I'd make them glass balls roll back to your skull
Call a tail number, where you wanna go?
The fuck do he got that I don't got a lot of?
There go my ego again, that's the problem
The fuck you expect? I go get what I want
I want you to say you pick me with your voice
I'm twenty-five up, but I can't buy your choice
You're priceless to me, but that's not the point
You got me out here smokin' joints
You got me out here losin' point
I'm cancellin' shoots and I'm cancellin'—
I'm hitchhiking, you pull over, so invitin'
The seat got my name on it, but who driving?
He hiatus, we spend time, and we repeat and we rewind it
Your headlights? It hit my eyelid
Love is blinding, y'all together? Don't remind me, so confusin'
What we doing? How y'all doing?
Oh, you choosin' him? Okay, I gotta cope with losing, fuck
I ain't been sleepin' well
Twin, I'll never tell
Stay busy so I don't think, 'cause downtime is when it sink in
I stare at old pictures, I, I thought you wanted to dance (Dance)
I thought you wanted to dance, I

Maybe, maybe (For you)
What's the chance, though?
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you
So don't forget about me, ba-ba-ba-da
I'll save a dance just for you
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you (Only for you, only for you)
So don't forget about me (No), ba-ba-ba-da
I'll save a dance just for you

If we're talkin' 'bout real meals, ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em
I've been in this fuckin' room so long
My eyeballs are turning to drywall

My stomach angry and yellin', I need some food, I could order
But I hate eating solo
Need someone, we can loiter in parking lots
As sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone

So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' blowing

Yo, now you gon' start me from the top? Listen
Shout out Harlem, man
Shout out A$AP Rocky, man
AWGE in the building, man
What's good? Is that potato salad?
Yo, listen

Niggas give me the cold shoulder, I can speak for myself
So I keep a high waist and alligator the belt
And got a belt with the holster, I ain't playing games
But got some lil' niggas who would do it so I pass the controller
You get pressed and X out, tri-angle your nose
Pause your life if you squares try to mess with my O's, woah
So cut the crap like shit barbers
'Cause we really with the beef like closeted gay fathers
Nigga we get dollars, give 'em to Ben Baller
Exchange for them chains that's all shiny with thick water
I got back pains, neck heavy like whipped cream
My whip clean, and they all white, I whip cream
And cop boys and I joystick, I whip cream and cop cribs
I got more space than big jeans, y'all sleeping on me
Explain why they got shit dreams
I'm alien, got the laser gun with the big beam
Married to the money, my bitch green
No I don't sip lean, but ride around in rockets like Yao Ming
Y'all niggas weak
They thought I was goofy and all mouses
Double C my luggage and fill them with Comme blouses
Y'all cop kush, my nigga I cop houses
And fill 'em with some Leo DiCap's and some Cole Sprouses, nigga
Where we? Rocky, A$AP
GOLF, boy, where we at? Nigga in Paris

Fuck clothes, I cop pieces
Couple thots with me and them hoes is like divas
Got my Vans on but they look like sneakers
Flipped a couple packs, BasedGod in the speakers
Bass all in the speakers
In the field like baseball, play ball, face wall when polices come
I don't rock Chanel, I rock channel
And no this ain't a purse, it's a satchel (At you)
Bless, at you, nah, I ain't sneeze
But if niggas want steam or smoke, bet I match you
Got a bullet with your name on the barrel
If hollows don't clip, you get nip like it's cat food
That dude, when I die, they gotta make a statue
Bad attitude, this ain't a purse, it's a satchel
Go to any nigga with money up in my bracket
Then I think about the state of rapping
All the freshmens in the classes
All the super seniors' mumblin' and ramblin'
Mumblin' and rappin', mumble rapping?
I find it hard to find actual talent
I find it hard to find an actual challenge
I'm like Shabazz Palace's last acid hit, elaborate
Rap lab's labyrinth, word to Kodak's Black's Lazarus
"CALLDROPS" on the album skits

Ayo, I'm the channel that you watch, I'm the ammo in the Glock
Weird nigga, full suit with the sandals and the socks, stop
And based on my neck boy
You would think I hate glass homes way I'm handling the rocks
Who cast the first stone? Bitch, it's me, fuck you thought?
Real grunge nigga, I ain't got a flannel as the top
And I'm picking up guitar, strum nigga
Bum niggas wish they could make a garden shed
But they sleeping on me man like their arm is dead
I'm a wild nigga boy and you farmer bred, born
You ain't animal, you are, corn, hahaha, yeah!

K shiz, what up, nigga!

I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
'Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves
Shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty-four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that, cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts, fuck
I love you
Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good

I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah

Girl, you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest
Look, Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathin'
And you'll see the meaning of stalkin'
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seein' with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evenin'
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name, I cannot stop cheesin'
I love you so much that my heart stops beatin' when you're leavin'
And I'm grievin' and my heart starts bleedin'
Life without you has no goddamn meanin'
Sorry, I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I fall for you, but I love you

I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

The sky's falling, girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling, girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling, girl, let's try to catch it tonight
The sky's falling, girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling, girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling, bitch, let's try to catch it tonight
C'mon, baby, even though I hate you, I still love you
I love you
And Salem, my love (I know)
I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)

See, I get jealous (Fuck)
And if I see that nigga (If I see him)
I just might kill him, haha (Look)

Love, love, love

Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (Denim pockets)
On my waist, there's a black Glock (Black Glock)
New girl moved on the block (On the block)
She been plottin' on my brown cock (Brown cock)
Last night, I slept over hers (Over hers)
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now, she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude
The blinds wide open so he can (Ooh)
See you in the dark when you're sleepin' (Ooh)
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours (Ah, ah)
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom (Ah, ah)
You're sleeping alone in bed (Ooh, ooh)
But check your window (Swag)
He's at your window

Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to Earth nigga with intentions that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one (Nope)
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See, when I'm with my friends, I just put on a front
But in the back of my top, I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time, yeah
The blinds wide open so he can (Ooh; Yeah)
See you in the dark when you're sleepin' (Ooh)
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours (Ah, ah)
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom (Ah, ah)
You're sleeping alone in bed (Ooh, ooh)
But check your window
He's at your window

One, two; you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven; shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, baby, you're gorgeous (Ooh)
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest (Ooh-ooh)
And fornicate with it
But that's because I'm in love with you, cunt
I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place (Cunt)
I just wanna talk and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place, cunt
The blinds wide open so he can (Ooh)
See you in the dark when you're sleepin' (Ooh)
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours (Ah, ah)
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom (Ah, ah)
You're sleeping alone in bed (Ooh, ooh)
But check your window
He's at your window
The blinds wide open so he can (Ooh)
See you in the dark when you're sleepin' (Ooh)

Home invasions got my brothers dyin'
Notice every car that's drivin' by
I think my neighbors want me dead
I got a cannon underneath the bed
Triple checkin' if I locked the door
I know every creak that's in the floor
Motherfucker, I am paranoid, I (Such a—)
Loop around the block, eyes glued to the rearview
Rather double back than regret hearin', "Pew, pew"
Never trust a bitch, if you good, they could trap you
So just strap it up 'fore they fuck around and strap you, bitch

You'll never see it comin' 'cause you're blinded from the start
Know that you're that one for me, it's clear for everyone to see
Ooh, baby, ooh, yeah (You gotta rock away to this one)
You will always be my boo (Come on)
See, I don't know 'bout y'all, but I know about us and, uh (Oh!)
It's the only way we know how to rock
I don't know 'bout y'all, but I know about us and, uh (Oh!)
It's the only way we know how to rock

Do you remember, girl?
I was the one who gave you your first kiss
'Cause I remember, girl
I was the one who said, "Put your lips like this"
Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
Girl, I was there when you were my baby

It started when we were younger, you were mine (My boo)
Now, another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (My boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (It's alright, girl, that's okay)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine (My boo)
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like (My boo, that's my baby)
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide (I can't hide it, my boo)
And even though there's another man who's in my life
You will always be my boo

Yes, I remember, boy
'Cause after we kissed, I could only think about your lips
Yes, I remember, boy
The moment I knew you were the one I could spend my life with
Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
I was there
And you were my baby

It started when we were younger, you were mine (You were mine; My boo)
Now, another brother's taken over, but it's still in your eyes (Yes, in here; My boo)
Even though we used to argue, it's alright (It's alright now, it's okay; My boo)
I know we haven't seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
I was in love with you when we were younger, you were mine (You were mine, my boo; My boo)
And I see it from time to time, I still feel like (It's still in your eyes; My boo)
And I can see it no matter how I try to hide (It's alright now, it's okay; My boo)
And even though there's another man who's in my life (But we hadn't seen each other)
You will always be my boo (You will always be my...)

Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got somethin' to tell you
Listen

See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See, this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent, she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

But you remind me of a girl that I once knew (Oh, oh)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Whenever I look, I look)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (Won't believe, won't believe, won't believe it, baby, uh, oh no, no)
This is why I just can't get with you

Thought that she was the one for me
'Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexin' everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

You remind me of a girl that I once knew (No, no no no, no, ah yeah)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Have a bad look, I look at you)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (She put me through, yeah)
This is why I just can't get with you (Uh)

(I know, yeah)
I know it's so unfair to you (Ha! It's so unfair)
That I relate her ignorance to you (Whoa, oh I)
Wish I knew (Wish I knew how to separate the two)
You remind me (You remind me)
Whoa, whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ah, oh...

You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Gotta let you go)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (Said I had, huh)
This is why I just can't get with you (Gotta let you go)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (You remind me, of a girl, hey)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Hey! Oh! Oh! You wouldn't believe it)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (All the shit she put me through)
This is why I just can't get with you (No no)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (You remind me of a girl that, that I once knew, oh no no)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Oh no, no, no, no)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you (You wouldn't believe )
You remind me of a girl that I once knew (Uh, baby I'm sorry, I gotta let you go, oh whoa, no)
See her face whenever I, I look at you (Baby I'm sorry, I gotta let you go, no, no, no)
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (Oh no, oh no)

If you dance on a pole, that don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind
When you work until three, if you're leavin' with me
Go make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
'Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you comin' home
Girl, I don't mind

The ballers in here tonight, they gon' buy a hundred bottles
As soon as you shake it I know they gon' make it colossal in here
'Cause shawty, you thinkin' them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas, they crowdin' around you like they seen Beyoncé in here (she here, she here!)
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
'Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

Shawty, I don't mind
If you dance on a pole, that don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind
When you work until three, if you're leavin' with me
Go make that money, money, money

You can take off your clothes, long as you comin' home

When you get off of work I'll be ready to go in the 'Rari
And when we get home we'll have us our own private party in here
So I don’t worry at all about the things they do or say
I love you anyway
You can twerk while in a split, you rackin' up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin', I'm proud to call you my bitch
They'd be lookin', but they can't touch you, shawty, I’m the only one to get it
So just go ahead and keep doin' what you're doin'

Shawty, I don't mind
If you dance on a pole, that don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind
When you work until three, if you're leavin' with me
Go make that money, money, money

'Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you comin' home
Girl, I don't mind

(It's ya boy, Juicy J)
I’m just tryna cut her up, tryna bust a nut
Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

Shawty, I don't mind
If you dance on a pole, that don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind
When you work until three, if you're leavin' with me

===== Usher - U Got It Bad =====
55 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschU Got It Bad Lyrics
Ooh-oh
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No-ooh

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe...

(You) You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone (Oh, yeah), hang up and you call right back
(Oh, you) You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off-track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (You can have it all and)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just 'cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know, I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her, "I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
Ladies, say, "I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can"

See, I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that, this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad

You got it, you got it bad (Hey, hey, no, no)
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, ha, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track (Yeah)
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house (Oh, you're stuck)
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about (Look at yourself)
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else (Somebody)
You got it bad


You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else

On the couch, on the table, on the bar, or on the floor
You can meet me in the bathroom
Yeah, you know I'm trained to go

Might as well give me a kiss
If we keep touchin' like this
I know you're scared, baby, they don't know what we doin'
Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up, girl, and I swear

69 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschBurn Lyrics
Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is somethin' I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn

It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time comin', but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn (Yeah), let it burn (Ooh), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through (Yeah)
Let it burn (Let it burn, woah), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn

Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feelin' ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now, it's too late
I know she ain't comin' back
What I gotta do now (Now) to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to (Oh)
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't (Cause the party ain't)
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (Gotta let it burn, oh), gotta let it burn (Oh)
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over (Know it's over), we knew it was through (Know it's through)
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn (Ooh, girl, I)

I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Can you feel me burnin'?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn), let it burn, gotta let it burn
Ooh, deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn)

===== Usher - You Make Me Wanna... =====
31 ContributorsYou Make Me Wanna... Lyrics
This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ooh, baby)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me (Make me, you're makin' me)
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me

Before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was havin' problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how—

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, babe)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, babe)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Oh yeah)
You make me, you make me

Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowin' it should've been you
And what's sad is that I love her, but I'm fallin' for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Say what you do)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Ah, yeah)
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Yeah-hey)
You make me, you make me

At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go (Gotta let her go)
And if she may not understand it while all of this is goin' on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me (You make me wanna)

(Hey) You make me wanna
You make me wanna (Oh)
(Oh, you make, make, make me)
You make me wanna
You make me wanna (Ooh, oh, babe)
You make me wanna (Go on, babe, do your thing)
You make me wanna (Ooh, ooh-ooh yeah)
(Come along wit' it, you're makin' me, you're makin' me)

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Say what you do)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Ah, yeah)
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Yeah-hey)
You make me, you make me (You're makin' me)
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ooh, you're makin' me, you're makin' me, you're makin' me)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Oh)
You make me, you make me (You make me)
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Wanna leave the one I'm with)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (You make me, you make me do)

Watch this

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say (Oh, oh)
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Yeah, yeah)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do (No)
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions (This is part two, oh, oh)
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (Tell it all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (I don't know, I don't know)
But to give you part two of my confessions

Sitting here, stuck on stupid, tryin' to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with, over with
I'm riding in my whip, racin' to her place
Talking to myself, preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't wanna come near me
I said, "One second, baby, please hear me"

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say (Oh)
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Chick on the side, oh, I)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed (So gone, so gone) and I don't know what to do
(What to do) I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (Cried, when I got it)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (Didn't know what to do)
But to give you part two of my confessions (But I need to tell you, baby)

This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm havin' a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please

These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call

Watch me as I dance under the spotlight
Listen to the people screaming out more, more
'Cause I create the feeling that keep them coming back
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep them coming back
So captivating when I get it on the floor

Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left, I show up

If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

Get up both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite
Put em in the air, if you more, and more
'Cause I can't wait to feel it
I go hard, can't stop
But if I stop, just know that I'ma bring it back
Never quitting, don't believe in that

Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure with seconds left, I show up

If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more, scream it out louder
If you on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

Oh, oh

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made a mess of what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all, at all

Going nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now
When I need you around?
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going

Nowhere fast
We've reached the climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit, so we choose to run away
Do we separate?
Oh, don't wanna give in, so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax

In and out my life, I've hit, love and left in tears
Without a care

Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
Met this girl, turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise and I

27 ContributorsLove in This Club Part II Lyrics
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Soundz, I hear you, man
Usher
Yeah, this hit right here
Queen B, yeah
I'm the king, y'all know that
She the queen, came right back
Listen to me
Yeah, yeah
Oh, remix

Now, baby girl, there ain't nothin' more that I can say
You know by now, I want it more than anything
If I walk away and just let you leave
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody
I know you want it (Yeah)
But I'm hesitatin' (Why?)
You must be crazy, I got a man, you got a lady
I know, we here together, so this must be somethin' special
'Cause you could be anywhere you wanted

But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
Don't be shy, come let your boy get in
So you can tell all of your friends
You was on the remix, like...

In this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watchin', I ain't stoppin'
Baby, I don't give up
In this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watchin'
Baby, I don't give up in this club

Baby, you know I'd be down
But we can't have all these people starin', standin' around
This right here is only for your eyes to see
But you gettin' carried away, sayin' we can do it wherever
The way you touchin' me like no other
I'ma make you feel insane
Tryin' your hardest to make me give in
But I'ma be down to give you whatchu wantin' if you keep it up
I strongly doubt this velvet rope would hold me up
And I don't want security rollin' up on us (I got you)
I'm not hesitatin', I just don't wanna rush
You could be anywhere you wanted

But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
I guess if I mess around and let you get in
You gon' tell all of your friends
You was on this remix, like...

In this club, in this club
Fellas, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watchin', I'm stoppin'
Baby, I don't give up
In this club, in this club
Ladies, can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watchin'
Baby, I don't give up in this club

Ahem, shawty want a thug
It started with a hug
And the rest went like this
I gave her neck, a kissy-kiss
She gave my neck a kiss back
I said, we could do it like a stack
I mean, we could do it like a G
On the couch in V.I.P
Shawty, we could get it on
I'm like, "Shout out to the DJ for playin' this song"
Girl, we could act like two damn fools
And everybody think we doin' a dance move
Call me, so I can make it juicy for ya
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover, girl
Haha, and it started with a hug
But now we makin' love in this club
And we not gonna stop just because
The people in the crowd are watchin' us
But we don't give a damn what they say
And this is the, the remix, baby

Come a little closer to Daddy, put it on you
Need you to know what happens here, stays here
And I'm ready and willin', almost got to go
Got you standin' at attention, keep it on the low
Ain't nobody watchin', don't worry, they can't see us
I know I got you hot, now let me in
You in the club or the car, wherever you are
Run and tell the DJ, run it back on replay

In this club, in this club
Fellas (Ladies), can I put this love up on you one time?
If you ain't scared, say what's up
In this club, in this club
They can keep watchin', I ain't stoppin'
Baby, I don't give up
Now, run and tell all of your friends
You gotta hear this remix, like...

King and queen, y'all know
Yeah, man
If we make love in this club
What would music be without Soundz?
In this club, in this club
Nobody will know, baby...

Fifty thousand fans screamin' in a rage
Bodyguards (Bodyguards) and limousines
This is the way I see you in my dreams
Paparazzi flash, a hundred pictures, all of you
Hangin' on my bedroom wall
I'm a kid again, I feel like thirteen
But I knew since we fell in love, girl, I'd be

===== Vanilla Ice - Ice Ice Baby =====
170 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolIce Ice Baby Lyrics
Yo VIP, let's kick it
Ice, ice, baby
Ice, ice, baby

Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
"Will it ever stop?" Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights, and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance, go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gangway
You better hit bullseye, the kid don't play
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby

Now that the party is jumpin'
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point, no fakin'
Cookin' MCs like a pound of bacon
Burnin' 'em if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With the ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby, wavin' just to say hi
“Did you stop?” No, I just drove by
Kept on, pursuin' to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm headin' to the next block
The block was dead, yo, so I continued to
A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous, 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a 9
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my 9, all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene, you know what I mean?
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla

Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
These are rhymes you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say, “Damn!”
If rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while Deshay revolves it
Ice ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice, ice, baby
Vanilla Ice ice, baby
Vanilla Ice

Yo man, let's get out of here
Word to your mother
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)
Ice, ice, baby (Too cold, too cold)

YO! It's the green machine
Gonna rock the town without being seen
Have you ever seen a turtle Get Down?
Slammin and Jammin to the new swing sound
Yeah, everybody let's move
Vanilla is here with the New Jack Groove
Gonna rock, And roll this place
With the power of the ninja turtle bass
Iceman, Ya know I'm not playin
Devastate the show while the turtles are sayin

Ninja, Ninja, RAP! Ninja, Ninja, RAP! GO GO GO GO!
Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO: Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO!
Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO: Go Ninja, Go Ninja, GO!
GO GO GO GO!

Lyrics, fill in the gap
Drop that bass and get the NINJA RAP
Feel it, if you know what I mean
Give it up, For the heroes in green
Just flowin, Smooth with the power
Kickin' it up, Hour after hour
Cause in this life there's only one winner
You better aim straight so you can hit the center
In it to win it, With a team of four
Ninja Turtles that you gotta adore it's the

Chorus

Villians you better run and hide
Because one day you might not slide
So choose, Your weapon but don't slip
Vanilla's in control with the flex of the mic grip
Rockin the crowd the way it should be rocked
With the Miami drop that you like alot
You know it's hittin, Like a ninja turtle
When the bass kicks in, You better check your level
The power of the ninja is strong
Fightin all crooks until they're all out cold
Chorus 2x

Yo, Vanilla. Kick it one time, boy!
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell
A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell
In ecstasy in the back of me
Well that's my DJ D-Shay cuttin' all them Z's
Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy
Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy
I'm lettin' my drug kick in
It controls my mouth and I begin
To just let it flow, let my concepts go
My posse's to the side yellin', Go Vanilla Go!
Smooth cause that's the way I will be
And if you don't give a damn, then
Why you starin' at me
So get off cause I control the stage
There's no dissin' allowed
I'm in my own phase
The girlies say they love me and that is ok
And I can dance better than any Kid 'N Play

Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music, white boy I can't hear you, say it
Play that funky music say it, say it, say
Play that funky music, white boy it, come on
Yea, a little bit louder
Now come on, come on
Stage 2—Yea the one ya' wanna listen to
It's off my head so let the beat play through
So I can funk it up and make it sound good
1-2-3 Yo—Knock on some wood
For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious
Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious
I'm an effect and that you can bet
I can take a fly girl and make her wet
I'm like Samson—Samson to Delilah
There's no denyin', You can try to hang
But you'll keep tryin' to get my style
Over and over, practice makes perfect
But not if you're a loafer
You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls
Soon—Oh my God, homebody, you probably eat
Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it!

Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music white boy Let's do it
VIP. Vanilla Ice yep, yep, I'm comin' hard like a rhino
Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino
So punks stop trying and girl stop cryin'
Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin'
Cause why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue
Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along
All through the ghetto groovin' this here song
Now you're amazed by the VIP posse
Steppin' so hard like a German Nazi
Startled by the bases hittin' ground
There's no trippin' on mine, I'm just gettin' down
Sparkamatic, I'm hangin' tight like a fanatic
You trapped me once and I thought that
You might have it
So step down and lend me your ear
'89 is my time! Yo, '90 is my year
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, I
Play that funky music white boy can't hear you

You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it
Your body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it
So don't be mad and don't be sad
Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad
You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure
Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure
So come up close and don't be square
You wanna battle me—Anytime, anywhere
You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong
So come on, everybody and sing this song
Say—Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go
Play that funky music Go white boy, go white boy, go
Lay down and boogie and play that funky music till you die
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, let me hear
Play that funky music white boy you say it, say it
Play that funky music A little louder now
Play that funky music, white boy Come on, Come on, Come on
Play that funky music

===== Vanilla Ice - Baby Got Back =====
3 ContributorsBaby Got Back Lyrics
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough
'Cause you noticed that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin’
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin’
Oh baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take yo’ picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (Me so horny)
Ooh, Rumpo Smoothskin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen her dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! Fellas!
Has your girlfriend got the butt?
Tell 'em to shake it! Shake it!
Shake that healthy butt!

Baby got back!
Baby got back!

I like 'em round and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh!
I ain't talkin' ‘bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Vanilla's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna
Til’ the break of dawn!
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! Ladies!
If you wanna roll my Mercedes
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout

Baby got back!
Baby got back!

Yeah, baby
When it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection
36-24-36? Ha ha
Only if she's 5'3"!

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that "hard" role
And tell you that the butt ain’t gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well, I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' ‘bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sister, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a Triple-X throwdown
Dial 1-900-VANILLAICE
And kick them nasty thoughts

Baby got back!
Baby got back!

Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back

To the one on the flamboyant tip
I'll just toss that ham in the frying pan
Like spam, I’m done when I come and slam
Damn, I feel like the Son of Sam
Don't make me wreck shit, hectic
Next get the chair got me going like General Electric
"Aaaant", the lights are blinking, I'm thinking
It’s all over when I go out drinking
Ohh, making my mind slow
That's why I don't fuck with the big 4-O
Bro, I got to maintain
'Cause a brother like me is going insane

Insane in the membrane
*Insane in the brain!*
Insane in the membrane
*Insane in the brain!*
Insane in the membrane
*Crazy insane, got no brain!*
Insane in the membrane
*Insane in the brain!*

Do my shit undercover, now it's time for the blubber
Blabber, to watch that belly get fatter
Fat boy on a diet, don't try it
I'll jack yo' ass like a looter in a riot
My shit’s fat, like a sumo, slamming dat ass
Leavin’ dat face in the grass
You know, I don't take a duro, lightly
Punks just jealous ’cause they can't outwrite me
So kick that style, wicked, wild
Happy face brother never seen me smile
Rip that mainframe, I'll explain
A brother like me is going insane

Insane in the membrane
*Insane in the brain!*
Insane in the membrane
*Insane in the brain!*
Insane in the membrane
*Crazy insane, got no brain!*
Insane in the membrane
*Insane in the brain!*

Like Louie Armstrong, played the trumpet
I'll hit that bong and break you off something
Soon, I got to get my props
Cops, come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Underground to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I’m out in a nine-deuce Cad'
Yes I'm the pirate, pilot
Of this ship if I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen?
Look, but don't make you eyes strain
A brother like me is going insane

Insane in the membrane

===== Vanilla Ice - Hooked =====
9 ContributorsHooked Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4
Hit it, hit it

Yeah, here's a story bout' my homeboy Randy
He was hooked on a girl named Candy
Started off as sex for fun
Now the girl's got him on the run
Made love to her just one time
Now she runs his body and mind
He calls everyday on the phone
But baby's playin' games ("Leave a message at the tone")
Soft and gentle is not her style
This girl is so damn wild
All my partners wanna get next to her
But she ain't down with that, She moves right through 'em
Yeah, like paper plates
Tears 'em up and she throws 'em away
If you had any guts today
You'd get your butt up, and you'd walk away
But you're hooked

Hooked, hooked
Know what I'm sayin', you're hooked, hooked
Hooked (Two, hit it!)

Yo, Get tough was your new campaign
Cryin' over a girl, boy, you're insane
She treats you like a dirty diaper
Use you one time and then she wipes you out
You understand what I'm sayin'?
If you're a man, you'll stop delaying and betraying
Try to act like you were mack
You can't go an hour without that sex attack
What's wrong, boy, is it that good? (You got it!)
There's a lot of girls that would and could
Take you, But you're so damn weak
I think you need to seek
Professional help, For your problems
Lay on the couch and let the doctor solve 'em
Talkin' to you and now he took your money
You're took on that honey, You're hooked (Hooked, hooked, hooked, hooked...)

Hooked, hooked
Fellas, you know what I'm sayin', he's hooked
Ain't got an ounce of mack in him, he's hooked

Yeah, baby, run you, she takes your money
While you'll kick back cryin' over honey
Now, I must admit she's fly
But i'll be damned if oh me oh my
If I ever let a girl run my thing
I'm poppin' it the most, you know what I'm sayin'?
So understand, you gotta be real hard
Don't treat her like a dog, but let her know
You'll pull her card if she ever gets outta hand
What is you a boy or a man?
Stand up and tell baby you ain't gonna be shook
Yo punk, you're hooked on that s-s-s-y
I don't know why
I don't stand by
And just let a girl run over me
Fool, I'm a man, can't you see?
Boy, you're hooked

Yeah, you're hooked, might as well give her to me man
Let me do the wild thing, you're hooked
Shoot, I'm poppin' it man, you're hooked

Yo man, check it out, let me talk to you for sec
So, what's up, Vanilla?
Yo man, come here man, what?
You know, man, you ain't doin' it right. You're off man
See, you know what the problem is?
That ring I bought her... The diamonds weren't big enough (Nah man)
I'm tellin' ya' the diamonds weren't... I'm goin'... You know
What she wants... I'm goin' tell ya'... (Nah man, nah)
When I first met her she said she wanted a 'vette (A 'vette?!)
I'm gonna' get her a vette
No man, no...a 'vette...
I'm gonna get her the 'vette! (No man, hey, wait up!)

Now it's Saturday, the day you hate most
Why, because from coast to coast
You see girls everyday in the club, cold kickin' it
Reminds you of baby when you used to be wit' it
But now she took you one time for sex and you're so sprung
That the next time she seen you
We knew, she had to leave you
Boy, you're hooked

Boy, you're hooked
Boy, you're hooked
Hooked
Hooked

===== Vanilla Ice - Stop that train =====
5 ContributorsStop That Train Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4

It was an average night, backstage at a show
I seen this girlie that I knew, she was a cutie and yo!
She had it goin' on, from her head to her feet
Her shape was so petite, and so unique
Her eyes, flamed with passion like she was possessed
As I shivered and quivered, while she rubbed on my chest
'Slaved and engraved I couldn't scream, huh
Moaning and groaning like she could take on the A-Team
I was one of many that she'd choose
Do me, pursue me, twice as nice but don't refuse
Leaving her breathless as the sweat poured on
The spot that I was in was so soft and warm
This was far from a story you will find in a book
Hot off the platter, and boy, could she cook
Roastin' my body it left a stain in my brain
And all I kept sayin' to myself was

Stop that train, I wanna' get off
Stop that train, I wanna' get off

Oh my God, what have I got into?
Sooner or later I thought she'd get the clue
Cause my body was tired and full of sweat and perspire
The situation I was in could've started a campfire
No more skeezin' and teasin' for the Ice right now
I found me a corner, play it cool for a while
Just mackin' and schemin' on a woman I thought was cool
But now I realize that the Ice was the fool
Cause a woman will play you, lay you and obey you
You better watch your back, cause a woman will slay you
Not to mention the one who got me
Yea, she got me, the I-C-E
But, back to the story of a one night stand
I thought I was strong but she was He-man
Lovin' every second tryin' to make me blush
And all 'n all it was for the lust
I though, she was an angel, and soft as a cream puff
Until I seen her come out with the whip and handcuffs
Breathin' down my neck I was scared to death
The sweat from my body as it rolls down my neck
And out of all nights, where was my crew?
Cause this was somethin' I didn't know what to do
Dee already told me that the girlie was strange
But I didn't know, until she pulled out the chains
Walkin' and stalkin' towards me with a plan
And now I regret all the things I was sayin'
Now the moment is critical, so what should I do?
Leave while I can, or just take the abuse
Now I'm drippin' with sweat, Why? cause I'm afraid
Handcuffs and chains is a game I don't play
No doubt in my mind that the girlie is the boss
Stop this train cause I wanna get off!

Stop that train, I wanna' get off
Stop that train, I wanna' get off

Later on that night as it got worse
My body's steamin' up and I was ready to burst
She had me hot as a skillet taken from a flame
And my admission was free for me to ride on this train
Yea, I must admit to myself, it was fun
But, now I'm lookin' for my shoes, I'm ready to run
So, now I'm hopin' and prayin' for the moment to come
Cause I couldn't move and my body was numb
So, now what have I done to get myself into this?
It started from a kiss, now I'm ready to resist
I couldn't take it no more, on the bed, or the floor
My knees were gettin' weak and my back was gettin' sore
The room was destroyed, not to mention my body
Why did I ever tell her to "Pump it, Hottie?"
What could I do to just ease the pain?
I think I'll let the hook just try to explain

Stop that train, I wanna' get off
Stop that train, I wanna' get off
Stop that train, I wanna' get off
Stop that train, I wanna' get off

Makin' niggas go Bo! Bo! like I'm Super Cat
Me fear no one, oh no, here come

Put the needle to the groove, I gets rude
And I'm forced to fuck it up
My style carries like a pick-up truck
Cross the clear blue yonder, sea to shinin' sea
I slam tracks like quarterback sacks from L.T
Now why try and test the Rebel INS?
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best
'Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake
And eat it, too, with my crew while we head state to state

And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus!

Meth is the legend, niggas is sleepy hollow
In fact I'm a hard act to follow

Yes, I come to get a slice of the punk and the pie
Rather do than die, check my flavor

Whatever you say rubs off me sticks to you

I smoke on the mic' like "Smokin' Joe" Frazier
The hellraiser, raisin' Hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider-Man
So, uh, tick-tock and keep tickin'
While I get you flippin' off the **** that I'm kickin'
The lone ranger
Code red, danger
Deep in the dark with the art
To rip the charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin', "Goodbye," like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck
Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel
I make more noise than heavy metal

The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal
Call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project
Then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, yo, flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with sixteen shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh'

It's the Method Man, for short, Mr. Meth
Movin' on your left
Uh, and set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like fame, my style'll live forever
Niggas crossin' over like they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a, "Soo?"
'Nough respect due to the 1-6-ooh
I mean, "Oh"
Yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson
Or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical bud make me—

Ooh
What? Grab my nut, get screwed
Ow
Here comes my Shaolin style
True
B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with the, "Soo"

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid (Come on, baby, baby, come on, baby, baby, come on, baby, baby, come on)
Watch your step, kid (Protect your neck)
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid
Watch your step, kid (Yo, you best protect your neck)

First things first, man, you're **** with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a **** nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat, rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man come to my center
You enter the winter
Straight up and down, now **** is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin', Ason Unique
Rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your **** ass

For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with **** in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stomping grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point blank as I kick the square biz
There it is
You're **** with pros
And there it goes

Yo, chill with the feedback, Black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the **** your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, wearin' Aéropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy robe
Then attack the globe
With the buckest
Style, the ruckus
Ten-times-ten, men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your **** chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums
He'll be comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My Clan increase like Black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare
Ge-Gecka-Genius, take us the **** out of here

The Wu is too slammin' for these cold killer labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now, that thought is just as bright as a twenty-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy, they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter fact, bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight

Huh, huh
Huh
Huh
Yo, yo, yo, yo

You best protect your neck (Watch your step, kid)
You best protect your neck (Watch your step, kid)
You best protect your neck (Watch your step, kid)
You best protect your neck (Watch your step, kid)

===== Wu-Tang Clan - Gravel Pit =====
111 ContributorsGravel Pit Lyrics
1,2, 1,2, yo check this out, it's the jump off right now
I want everybody, to put your work down, put your guns down
And report to the pit, the gravel pit
Leave your problems at home, leave your children at home
We gon' take it back underground, I be Bobby Boulders
Wu-Tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off, so just jump off my nigga

Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it

Ha, holocaust from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse, off course (off course)
Follow me, Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since Starks and Clark Wallabees
African killer bees blackwatch
On your radio, blowin out yo' watts
From Park Hill, the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill
Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill
Elbow grease, and elbow room
Baby play me, baby fall down, go boom
Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse
(I'm the kid with the golden arms)
And I'm the motherfuckin Hot Nicks pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month
Now I'm chokin, smokin, hopin
I don't croakin, from overdosin
Hey, kid, walk straight, master your high
Wu and Meth got you open (open), let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough
Remember what Ol' Dirty said: "I'll fuck yo' ass up!"
Now listen

Back, back and forth and forth

Eat with the English, extinguish styles extremist
Bald head beamers run wild
It's the kid with the gold cup
Stepped out like what
What's poppin, and y'all niggas dobo
Blastin shae shae, chocolate shortae
Rich color mocks, rock those all day
1960 shit I'm Goldie
That's right motherfucker don't hold me
The world's greatest, Las Vegas, paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos, Ghost bang out condos
Jeff from Hamo, ex three bangos
Bancos, stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those, bang those, same old, same old

Yeah y'all, straight up this the jump off right here
The gravel pit, word up represent, rock the boulders
All my rich gangsta style, killers, y'all know what time it is
Shorty do your thing, get up on that shit right now boo, do you
That's what I'm talkin 'bout

Yo, step to my groove, move like this
When we shoot the gift of course it's ruthless
Grab the mic with no excuses
In a sec, grab the Tecs, salute this
Executing, shaking all sets, and I'm breaking all hex
I'm taking all bets, wu bomb best, who want the dram' next
You want stank, we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real, while you crank
Slide, do or die, fry to bake
Admire the greats, on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark, every part I take, heavy darts that quake
It's okay, all fakes, get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill, yes it's Park Hill
Yo we hit 'em with the hot grits
On the go, check the flow, saying Wu don't rock shit
Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweating my pockets
I hear the hot shit

Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
You don't have to move a mountain
Just give me enough strength to climb
Oh Lord ! Don't take away my stumbling blocks to lead me around

Yakub, maker and creator of the devil. Swine merchant... your time is near at hand. Fuck with me and your time will be now. Your presence here effects the mind of my people like a fever. You, Yakub, are the bearer of nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine diseases, evil, corrupt, porkchop-eatin' brain!

===== Wu-Tang Clan - Triumph =====
261 ContributorsTriumph Lyrics
What? Y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me?
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here Forever, motherfuckers
This like, this '97
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to '79
I bomb atomically, Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun, explosion when my pen hits tremendous
Ultraviolet shine blind forensics
I inspect you through the future see millennium
Killa Beez sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets, Queen Beez ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight, incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, diehard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow, swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block

As the world turns, I spread like germ
Bless the globe with the pestilence, the hard-headed never learn
This my testament to those burned
Play my position in the game of life, standing firm
On foreign land, jump the gun out the frying pan
Into the fire, transform into the Ghost Rider
A six-pack and A Streetcar Named Desire
Who got my back? In the line of fire, holding back
What? My peoples; if you with me, where the fuck you at?
Niggas is strapped and they tryna twist my beer cap
It's court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm
What the blood clot? We smoke pot and blow spots
You wanna think twice? I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone, rip through your slums
I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP
Martini on the slang rocks, certified chatterbox
Vocabulary Donna talking, tell your story walking
Take cover, kid, what? Run for your brother, kid
Run from your team and your six camp rhyme groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reign supreme, your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my dart
I got the fashion catalog for all y'all to all praise to the Gods

The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Olympic torch flaming, we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony of defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow for
Judgment Day cometh, conquer, it's war
Allow us to escape, hell glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes split the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fateful step make, the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie, vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, catwalk, squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthesias
My orchestra, graceful music ballerinas
My music Sicily, rich California smell
An axe killer adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing Sing, sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperon, rotating ring kings
March of the Wooden Soldiers, C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square, we stand and glow like flare
Escape from your Dragon's Lair
In particular, my beats travel like a vortex
Through your spine, to the top of your cerebrum cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle, clog up your bloodstream
Heart terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat bass lines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation

War of the masses, the outcome, disastrous
Many of the victim families save their ashes
A million names on walls, engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for the axe
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song

The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
93 million miles away from
Came one to represent the Nation
This is a gathering of the masses
That come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The High Chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none
Yo, yo, yo, fuck that! Look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a navy green salamander fiend, bitches never heard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in '81
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cord by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black Noble Drew Ali, came in threes
We like the Genovese, Caesar needs the greens
It's Earth, 93 million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst, split the megahertz

Ayo, that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man-child walk
Swift notarizer, Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank' visor, word tranquilizer
Just a dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white-gold tarantula
Track truck diesel, play the weed God, substantiala
Max mostly, undivided, then slide in, sickening
Guaranteed, made 'em jump like Rod Strickland

"Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style"
"If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous. Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?"
"En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style"

Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!

Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!

Ghostface! Catch the blast of a hype verse
My Glock burst, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Your head rush, fly like Egyptian musk
Aww shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks, an'
However, I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin' terror, quick, damage your whole era
Hard rocks is locked the fuck up or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous, 'cause I wreck this dangerous
I blow spots like Waco, Texas

I watch my back like I'm locked down
Hardcore-hittin' sound, watch me act bugged and tear it down
Illiterate-type asshole, songs goin' gold
No doubt, and yo, watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah, they fake and all that, carryin' gats
But yo, my Clan roll with like forty macs
Now you act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo, soooo—represent!
I wait for one to act up, now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react what?
And that's one in the chamber, Wu-Tang banger
36 styles of danger

Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!

So bring it on!
I rip it, hardcore like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin'
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hangin'
Bust this, I'm kickin' like Seagal: Out for Justice
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder One, my style shocks your knot like a stun gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty-ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga
So bad, stabbin' up the pad with the vocab, crabs
I scream on your ass like your dad, bring it o-on!

Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!

Yo, I'm more rugged than slave man boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loose, and trample shit, while I stomp
A mudhole in that ass 'cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin' up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin' through your back *swish*
Givin' bystanders heart attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me, who is him?
I blow up his fuckin' prism, make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it, come on and bring the ruckus!
And I provoke niggas to kick buckets
I'm wettin' cream, I ain't wettin' fame
Who sellin' 'caine? I'm givin' out a deadly game
It's not the Russian, it's the Wu-Tang crushin' roulette
Slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin' rockets!

Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus!
“En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style.”
So, bring it on!

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck—I'll fuck your ass up!

Yo, hut one, hut two, hut three—hut!
Ol' Dirty Bastard, live and uncut
Styles unbreakable, shatterproof
To the young youth, you wanna get gun? Shoot!
Blaow! How you like me now? Don't fuck the style
Ruthless, wild—do you wanna
Get your teeth knocked the fuck out?
Wanna get on it like that? Well, then, shout!

Yo, RZA, yo, razor—hit me with the major
The damage, my clan understand it, be flavor
Gunnin', hummin', comin' at ya
First I'm gonna get ya, once I got ya, I gat ya
You could never capture the Method Man's stature
For rhyme and for rapture, got niggas resignin', now master
My style? Never!
I put the fuckin' buck in the wild, kid, I'm terror, razor-sharp
I sever, the head from the shoulders, I'm better than my compet'ta
You mean competitor, whatever, let's get together

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the tri—blaow!

I react so thick, I'm phat, and yo
Rae came blowin' and blew off your headphones, black
Rap from, yo, Cali to Texas
Smoother than a Lexus, now's my turn to wreck this
Brothers approach and half step
But ain't heard half of it yet and I bet you're not a fuckin' vet
So, when you see me on the real
Formin' like Voltron, remember I got deep like a Navy Seal

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
I'll fuck your ass up!

Yo!
I come with that ol' loco style from my vocal
Couldn't peep it with a pair of bifocals
I'm no joker, play me as a joker
Be on you like a house on fire—smoke ya
Crews be actin' like they gangs, anyway
Be like, "Warriors, come out and play!"
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea
Got burnt once—but that was only gonorrhea
Dirty, I keep shit stains in my drawers
So I can get fizzy-funky for ya
Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang
Rah! Here comes the Tiger vs. Crane
I'll be like wild with my style
Punk—you play me, chump, you get jumped
Wu! is comin' through at a theater near you
And get funk like a shoe

Hey, you, get off my cloud
You don't know me and you don't know my style
Who be gettin' flam when they come to a jam?
Here I am, here I am, the Method Man
Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, hey, the Method Man
Don't eat Skippy, Jif or Peter Pan
Peanut butter 'cause I'm not butter
In fact, I snap back like a rubber
Band, I be Sam, Sam-I-Am
And I don't eat green eggs and ham
Style'll hit ya, wham, then goddamn
You'll be like, "Oh shit, that's the jam"
Turn it up, now hear me get buck w-w-wild
I'm about to blow, light me up (Light me up)
Upside, downside, inside and outside
Hittin' you from every angle, there's no doubt I
Am the one and only Method Man
The master of the plan, rappin' shit like Saran
Wrap, with some of this and some of that
Hold up (What?) I tawt I taw a putty tat
Over there, but I think he best to beware
Of the diggy dog shit right here
Yippy-yippy-yay, yippy-yah, yippy-yo
Like Deck said, "This ain't your average flow"
Comin' like rah, ooh-ah, achie-kah
Tell me, how you like it so far, baby paw?
The poetry's in motion, coast to coast and
Rub it on your skin like lotion
What's the commotion? Oh my Lord
Another corn chopped by the Wu-Tang sword
"Hey, hey, hey" like Fat Albert
It's the Method Man, ain't no if ands about it
It's the Method

Alright, y'all, get your White Owls
Get your Meth', get your skins
Don't forget your 'orty
And we gonna do it like this

I got fat bags of skunk
I got White Owl blunts
And I'm about to go get lifted
Yes, I'm about to go get lifted
I got myself a Forty
And I got myself a shorty
And I'm about to go and stick it
Yes, I'm about to go and stick it, uh

H-U-F-F, huff, and I puff
Blow like snow when the cold wind's blowin'
Zoom, I hit the mic like boom
Wrote a song about it, like to hear it? Here it goes
Question, what exactly is a panty raider?
Ill behavior, savior or major flavor
All of the above, oh yeah, plus seducer
Also, flam, I'm the man, call me super
Not an average Joe with an average flow
Doin' average things with average hoes
Yo, I'm super, I'll make a bitch squirm
For my super sperm (Check it)
Check it, I give it to you raw butt-naked
I smell sess, pass the method
Let's get lifted as I kick ballistic
Missiles and shoot game like a pistol
Clip is loaded when I click bang (Bang)
A Wu-Tang slug hits your brain
J-U-M-P, jump, and I thump
Make girls rump like pump and Humpty Hump
Wild, the Shaolin style is all in me
Child, the whole damn isle is callin' me
P-A-N-T-Y, R-A-I-D-E-R, mad raw, I don't fry
Meaning, no one can burn or toss and turn me
Ooh, I be the super sperm
Chim-chimney, chim-chim, cher-ee
Freak a flow and flow fancy free
Now, how many licks does it take
For me to hit the Tootsie Roll center of a break?
Peep and don't sleep, the crew's mad deep (Wu-Tang)
Fadin' motherfuckers like bleach
So to each and every crew
You're clear like glass, I could see right through
Your whole damn posse be catchin' 'em all, 'cause you vic'd
And you didn't have friends to begin with, I'm—

The M-E-T-H-O-D Man
M-E-T-H-O-D Man
M-E-T-H-O-D Man
Here I am, here I am, the Method Man

Straight from the slums of Shaolin
Wu-Tang Killa Beez on a swarm
Your soul have just been tooken
Through the 36 Chambers of death, kid
Word to mother, Method Man signin' off, peace

===== Wu-Tang Clan - Da Mystery of Chessboxin' =====
257 ContributorsDa Mystery of Chessboxin’ Lyrics
A game of chess is like a swordfight
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used, it's almost invincible
Raw, I'ma give it to ya with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MCs approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force you're doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains

Well, I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum and the isle I'm from
Is comin' through with 'nough niggas and 'nough guns
So if you wanna come sweatin', stressin', contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain, there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like an eighteen-wheeler
With a drunk driver drivin', there's no survivin'

Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan, and yo, the Land Cruiser's out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome TECs, nickel-plated MACs, black Acs
Drug-dealin' styles with phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cause I gots to get my props and win it, yo
I got beef with commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lampin' in a Lexus, eatin' beef
Straight up and down, don't even bother
I got forty niggas up in here now who kill niggas' father

My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gat
Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombin' shit, boom
Just warmin' up a little bit, ah-eh-em
Rappin'-in' is what's happenin'
Keep the pockets stackin'-in', hands clappin'-in'
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody
Grab the microphone, put strength to the bone
Dun-dun-dun, enter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff, huff, puff
I'm gonna catch your bluff, tuff, rough
Kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley, m-m-Beetle Bailey rhymes
Comin' raw style, hardcore
Niggas be comin' to the hip-hop store
Comin' to buy grocery from me
Pretendin' to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot RZA
Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ho gettin' low with his flow
Introducin' the Ghostface Killah
No one could get iller

My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gat
Speakin' of the Devil, psych
No, it's the God, get your shit right
Mega trife, and yo, I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast shit
You reneged, tried again, and got blasted
Half-mastered-ass style, mad rough task
When I struck, I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night, yo, I was hittin' like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs
So, grab your eight-plus-one, start flippin' and trippin'
Niggas is jettin', I'm lickin' off, son

Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang (Toad style is immensely strong)

Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies the homicide when he dies in his own iniquity?
It's the master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at ya
We have an APB on an MC killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist, hard to capture
The flow changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim
You scream as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Movin' on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfuckin' contender

My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
In the front, in the back, Killa Beez on attack
My peoples, are you with me? Where you at?
Smokin' meth, hittin' cats on the block with the gat

And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used, it's almost invincible
Toad style is immensely strong
And immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used, it's almost invincible
When it's properly used

===== Kool G Rap - Streets of New York =====
29 ContributorsStreets of New York Lyrics
In the streets of New York
Dope fiends are leanin' for morphine
The TV screens follow the homicide scenes
You live here? You’re takin' a chance
So look and I take one glance, there’s a man inside an ambulance
Crowds are gettin' louder
I wonder how the people wanna go fight for the white powder
People hangin' in spots
They waited 'til the blocks got hot and got raided by the cops
I’ll explain, the man sleepin' in the rain
His whole life remains inside a bottle of Night Train
Another man got his clothes in a sack
'Cause he spent every dime of his rent playin' blackjack
And there’s the poor little sister
She has a little baby daughter named Sonya and Sonya has pneumonia
So why’s her mother in a club pullin' zippers?
Yo, that’s her job, Sonya’s mommy is a bar stripper
Drug dealers drive around lookin' hard
Knowin' they’re sendin' their brothers and sisters to the graveyard
Every day is a main event, some old lady limps
The pushers and pimps eat shrimps
It gets tirin', the sight of a gun firin'
Then there's desire for the sound of a siren
A bag lady dies in an alleyway
She’s seen the last of her days inside the subways
More and more down the slope, the kid couldn’t cope
So he stole somebody’s dope and a gold rope
Now my son’s on the run
He’s a wanted one, had fun then was done by a shotgun
Upstairs, I cover my ears in tears
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers
'Cause every day of his life, he beats his wife
'Til one night she decides to pull a butcher knife
Blind man plays the sax
A tune called “The Arms on My Moms Show Railroad Tracks"
Many lives are cut short
That’s when you’re livin', in the streets of New York


Baby needs new shoes
But his papa uses all the money for booze
A young girl is undressed in the back seat of a Caddy
Callin' some man daddy
Three men slain inside a apartment
All you could see was the sparks when it darkened
Daylight broke, cops roll on the scene
The drug war, daily routine
Gamblin' spots, just a poor man’s jackpot
You winnin' a lot, you get shot
The drug dealin' fanatics, but you don’t want no static
'Cause they got crack addicts with automatics
Shoot-outs for a desire for territory
A kid got caught in the crossfire
A tired mother can’t take no more
She grabbed a bottle full of sleepin' pills and took about 24
Human beings are layin' on the pavement
'Cause they’re a part of a mental enslavement
The cop snipers, little babies in dirty diapers
This type of life is makin' you hyper
People scoutin' a torched-out building
And got killed when the cold air filled in
Is Hell really suggested?
No more persons arrested, a child molested
A little kid says "Yo, I got a color TV, CD player and car stereo
And all I want is a castle, I also got a .38, don’t give me no hassle"
One kid heads straight for the top
And gets stopped and popped by a crooked cop
Look behind you when you walk
That’s how it is, in the streets of New York

===== Sir Mix-a-Lot - Posse on Broadway =====
50 ContributorsPosse On Broadway Lyrics
Me and Kid Sensation at home away from home
In the black Benz limo with the cellular phone
I'm calling up the posse it's time to get rippin'
A freak in each sunroof to keep you suckas trippin'
Everybody's looking if you're jealous turn around
The AMG kit keeps us closer to the ground
We're getting good grip from the 50 series tires
The Alpine's bumping but I need the volume higher
'Cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb
We're rolling Rainier and the jealous wanna get some
Every time we do this sucka mc's wanna battle
I'm the man they love to hate, the J.R. Ewing of Seattle
Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson
Heading for the strip, yes we're looking for some action
The limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leaning back
Maharaji's watching T.V. with two girlies on his lap
On Martin Luther King the set looks kinda dead
We need a new street so posse move ahead
We all look kinda swass, the crew you can't forget
The Mix-a-lot posse cold ripping up the set

My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

Rollin in, my posse was getting kinda bored
There's not another posse with more points scored
We don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas
My homeboy Kid Sensation is the teenage lady killa
Maharaji's on the def side dancing like a freak
The girlies see his booty and their knees get weak
Larry is the white guy people think he's funny
A real estate investor who makes a lot a money
Clocking lots a dollars, we all got gold
Cruising in this Benz and ain't got no place to go
Wheeling 23rd we saw nothing but thugs
The girlies was too skinny from smoking all them drugs
Cause the rock man got em and their butts just drop
The freaks look depressed because the Benz won't stop
At 23rd and Union the driver broke left
Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def
My girl blew me a kiss she said I was the best
She's looking mighty freaky in her black silk dress
The closer that we get, the crazier I feel
My posse's on Broadway, it's time to get ill

My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

Cruising Broadway and my wheels spin slow
Rolling with your posse is the only way to go
The girlies by the college was looking for a ride
We tried to pick em up but we had no room inside
We put em on the trunk we put em on the hood
Some sat up with the driver they made him feel good
The posse's getting bigger, there's much too many freaks
My muffler is dragging, my suspension's getting weak
Now the freaks are getting hungry & Mix-a-Lot's treatin'
We stopped at Taco Bell for some Mexican eatin'
But Taco Bell was closed the girls was on my tip
They said, "Go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Dick's"
Dick's is the place were the cool hang out
The swass like to play and the rich flaunt clout
Posse to the burger stand so big we walk in twos
We're getting dirty looks from those other sucker crews
Kid Sensation dropped a 20 and didn't even miss it
Skeezer from another crew, she picked it up and kissed it
Her boyfriend's illin, he went to slap her face
My homeboy PLB cold sprayed the boy with mace
Cause I never liked a punk who beat up on his girl
If you don't have game then let her leave your world
We took his girl with us
With him she rode the bus
She gave the boy the finger and the sucker starts to cuss
Boy, I got a def posse you got a bunch a dudes
You're broke cold crying about the rock man blues
Ya beat up on your girl and now your all upset
She's with the Mix-a-Lot posse on the Broadway set

Yeah

Welcome to Atlanta, jackin' hammers and vogues
Back to the mackin' and jackin' the clothes
Adolescent packin' a four
A knock on the door, (Who is it?) I would happen to know
The one with the flow, (Who did it?) it was me, I suppose
JD in the Rolls, and Luda's in the Cut Supreme
Skatin' down Old Nat, gat tucked and leaned
I split your spleen—as a matter of fact, I split your team
No blood on the sneaks, gotta keep it so my kicks is clean
I get the cream, cops see me flick my beams
I'm allergic so doc' prescribed antihistamines
Oink oink, pig pig, do away with the pork
Only silverware I need's a steak knife and a fork
Did you forget your fuckin' manners? I'm Bruce with banners
Ludacris, Johnny Rockets when I shoot the cannon
The wooly mammoth, saber-tooth, bitch, bite your tongue
I won't stop until I'm rich as them whites'll come
I pulled up in the black Lotus, your plaques are bogus
So I stripped them off the wall
Waitin' for my cue to corner pocket eight balls, you rackin' 'em up
I'm big paper like pancakes, stackin' 'em up
In fact, I'm slappin' 'em up, Cadillac is the truck
I can't lose with twenty-twos, bitch, that's what's up
Runnin' in the back to fuck, better that than the aquaduct
Chil-li-li-li-li-n.. fli-pi-pi-pi-pi-n, what?

Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin'
And parties don't stop 'til eight in the mo'nin'
Welcome to Atlanta where the players play

Yo, uhh
Now the party don't start 'til I walk in
And I usually don't leave until the thing ends (Uh)
But in the meantime, in between time
You work yo' thing, I'll work mine
I been puttin' it down here since eighty-three
Since the Lakeshore/MD rivalry
When Frozen Paradise was the place to be
If you was ridin', you was bumping to homie Shy-D
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballin-ist Player (Uh huh)
Make my own rules, bitch, call me the mayor
Monday night, Gentlemen's Club
Tuesday night, I'm up in the Velvet Room, gettin' fucked up
Wednesday, I'm at Strokers on lean
Thursday, Jump Clean, then I fall up in Kream
Friday, Shark Bar, Kaya with Frank Ski
Right on the flo' is where you can find me
Saturday, is off the heezy fo' sheezy
You can find me up in One-Tweezy
Sunday, is when I get my sleep in
'Cause on Monday we be at it again, holla!

60 ContributorsMiami Lyrics

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Miami, uh, uh
South Beach, bringin' the heat, uh
Ha-ha, can y'all feel that?
Can y'all feel that?
Jig it out, uh

Here I am, in the place where I come let go
In Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a Mardi Gras, everybody party all day
No work, all play, okay?
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me and Charlie at the bar, runnin' up a high bill
Nothin' less than ill, when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass, they be like, "Hi, Will!"
Can y'all feel me? All ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Haitian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami, welcome to Miami

Yo, I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin' to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin' out, "Will, we loved your last hit!"
So I'm thinkin' I'ma scoop me somethin' hot
In this salsa-merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees in the Caribbean seas
With the hot mamis screaming "¡Ay, papi!"
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your dough and flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound, anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
And if you ask how I know, I got's to plead the fifth

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami, welcome to Miami

Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin' on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin' heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnamon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimme your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jet skis, loungin' in the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, everybody got 'em
Ain't no surprise, in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home (Miami)

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami, welcome to Miami
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenidos a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin' to Miami, welcome to Miami

===== N.W.A. - Straight Outta Compton =====
259 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsStraight Outta Compton Lyrics
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas With Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)

Yo, Ren! (What's up?)
Tell 'em where you from!

Straight outta Compton, another crazy-ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)

Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming
Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is the autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)

Damn, that shit was dope!

I'm a BK brawler, Marcy projects hallway loiterer
Pure coke copper, get your order up

But it's gonna cost you more if I gotta get 'em to Florida
Rucker game attender with the Bent parked
On the sidewalk with the temp plates on the fender
I ain't hard to find, you catch me front and center
At the Knick game, big chain in all my splendor
Next to Spike if you pan left to right
I own Madison Square, catch me at the fight
With Cam, once again if you pan left of his ice
It be the man that write checks with the hand that don't write
I go off the head when I'm rambling on the mic
And I throw off the feds when I'm scrambling at night
And it was often said I brought hammers to the fight
But we from New York City, right Cam? (Ya damn right)

You get jammed with them jammers, blammed with them blammers
Hot here, ask Mase, he ran to Atlanta (Minister)
You think you know what life do, mink on the motorcycle
Trinkets they so delightful, blinging in so much ice fool (Bling)

And we won't stop 'til I get back blood, holla at 'em, Hov
I'm from Flushing, Marcy, Nostrand, Myrtle and Park
Niggas'll drive by in the day, murder you in the dark
That's why the Johnny gun I'm holding
Wet niggas up like the Johnny-pump is open, homie, I play hard

It's the home of 9/11, the place of the lost Towers
We still banging, we never lost power, tell 'em
Welcome to New York City
Welcome to New York City
Y'all fucking with BK's banger and Harlem's own gangster
Now that's danger, there's nothing left to say but, oh
Welcome to New York City
Welcome to New York City (Uh-huh)

Y'all niggas, man, y'all can't fuck around, man
It's the Roc, bitch, Killa (Welcome to New York City)
My nigga Jigga, Sigel, Beans (Welcome to New York City)
Diplomats, man, Hoffa, Dash
Get the fuck off our dick, no homo (Welcome to New York City)
Bullshit, whatever y'all wanna say for two minutes, man (Welcome to New York City)
I own this shit right now, man, I ain't going nowhere
Welcome to New York City

===== Lupe Fiasco - Paris, Tokyo =====
88 ContributorsParis, Tokyo Lyrics
I know, I know but I gotta get up outta here, you know?
I gotta go pay these bills, I got a show to do, you know?
One time, for your mind
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Wherever I go she go

I love her, and I hate to leave her lonely
Ring-ring went the iPhone, it was my homie
He said, "Let's hit Japan, if we can make 'em jam
We can make a hundred grand, spend it in the south of France"
Nothing further; I jumped, grabbed my Goyard trunk
Got ready to walk it out like Unk in my John Lennon Chucks
That's when I heard murder
"You're killing me, you're filling me with sorrow
Sunrise, goodbyes, and missing you tomorrows"
I turn to see my dream, love supreme queen
Meanest thing on the scene cry
I drop my bags in a flash, that's faster
Than 180 on that dash, shirt to dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher
You's the dame who's the username to all my passwords
The reason I get fly is Ibn Jasper
I even keep your picture in my passport
Love, love

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

So let's keep it real, all in together, "Free Chill"
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class seat and sleep
Don't wake me 'til I land
Where they barely understand what I speak
But they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am and they stand
And they clap, they applaud, they love me, my God
Otsukaresama deshita, or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint-Honoré, then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been, and
Everything that I done, and
Tell her that she's the one, and, umm

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

Guess who's back in the house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed you
In my dreams 'fore I went to sleep
To la-la land to count them sheep
I swear you're looking prettier than ever
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together, evermore
For better or, less or poor
Or worth our weight in buried treasure, X's on the shore
I know my world tour's like war to you
But Ian said, "Aloha", and Harley said, "Cheers"
Julian said, "Bonjour", Big O was like, "Yeah!"
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we going there
Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness
She said, "Pursue your interests 'cause even if I'm ticketless
I'll be there, by your side
In your heart, and on your mind"
So, as I taxi down another runway
I gotcha, who loves you bae
Now bring it back now

Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little whack
And my friends are just as screwy as me
I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they? I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket

Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills

Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean (Oh my god, do you see them?)
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between
I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
'Cause I'm the next big thing in

Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills


The truth is
I don't stand a chance
It's something that you're born into
And I just don't belong

No, I don't, I'm just a no-class beat-down fool
And I will always be that way (Yes, you will)
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play

Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills

Yeah, Beverly Hills (Rollin' like a celebrity)

Ah New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around, too much
Ah too many people, too much -- a ha hah
Too much, too many people, too much, rrrrrrrah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high
Built to shelter the rich and greedy
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows
Lookin' down on the poor and the needy
Miles of people, marchin' up the avenue
Doin' what they gotta do, just to get by
I'm livin' in the land of plenty and many
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, ah too many people, too much
Too much, too many people, too much!

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump
People gather round, said, "He won't he's just a chump"
'Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought
He got nothin' to eat, no shoes on his feet
She even left his clothes, out in the street
He keeps hearin' noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib
In this man's world, so much for women's lib

New York New York big city of dreams
But everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I know my way around

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly
But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes
They're sugar and spice and everything nice
But when you get 'em home ain't no tellin' what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eatin dog food out of a can
He says, "I got to eat, when I can't afford meat
I barely can stand, on my own two feet"
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it
Somethin's on my mind and I just can't shake it
I need some time, and I want some space
I gotta get away from the human race

Too much, ah too many people, too much... a-ha hah
Too much, ah too many people, too much! Rrrrrrrah!

Stand at a skyscraper reachin' into heaven
When over in the ghetto I'm livin' in hell
Just play ball or be an entertainer
'Cause niggas like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
I dream about a life but I'm livin' in a nightmare
Paranoid schitzo, set back, snowbound
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!

Hee, huh (16X) HUH!

If only I could sleep just ten more minutes
I might find the strength to make another day
If I didn't have to get up, and do my thing
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin 'bout ice cream
Whipped cream fruits and a cherry on top
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh
The pressure is on it ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind
I don't wanna be kissin' nobody's behind
Just standin' on line lookin' like a jerk
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work
I ran into a pothole, got into a car crash
Shoulda been thinkin and tried to fake whiplash
A crowd gathered round, they're callin' me fat
Who you lookin at wit a face like that?

New York New York big city of dreams
Everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

On 42nd Street, lookin for some action
Women standin' on the corner sellin' satisfaction
One young punk just leanin' on the fence
Tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Really is a prankster, tried to be a gangster
Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up
One dead punk, killed by the man

New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seem
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around
Too much, too many people, too much... ah ha hah hah
Too much, too many people, too much! HUAHH!

A baby cries and a mother dies
And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes because
In this room, on this day
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh
The gift of life really means a lot
And in the ghetto your life is all you got
So you take to the streets, tryin to exist
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch, on TV
A tells you what life is supposed to be
But when you look outside the only thing you see
Is the poverty stricken, reality, heh
Abandoned places, angry faces
Much hate and hunger throughout the races
You say, "I'm grown and I'm on my own
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!"
Now you stay at home, talkin on the phone
Doin ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone
They never took the time to tell you bout sex
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there
And the nigga that did it said, "I don't care!"
You don't have enough money to help feed two
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was cryin', rain and hail
When you put yo' baby in the garbage pail
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid
And you tried to forget what you just did, huh
The muffled screams of a dyin' baby
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy
So she ran in the rain tryin to ease the pain
Huh huh, and she drove herself insane

New York New York big city of dreams
But everything in New York ain't always what it seem
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Ah too much, too many people, too much... ah ha hah hah
Too much, too many people, too much! HUHHH!

Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got

Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine
Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it, my nigga?
Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from

Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans, nigga?
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans, nigga
Kendrick Conan, nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats

Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the Eastside
Know that's just how Compton roll

And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in

Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'ma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby

Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of N.W.A
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"
Ooh
Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie
Just Blaze
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine
Mom, I finna use the van real quick!
Be back, 15 minutes!

151 ContributorsI Used to Love H.E.R. Lyrics
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat, Com Sense'll be the sure shot, come on

I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out, and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her
Eventually, if it was meant to be, then it would be
‘Cause we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh, yo, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister
Boy, I tell you, I miss her

A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
A-Com Sense y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
UAC, yo, we gotta be the sure shot

Now, periodically, I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick
Did a couple of videos, and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
About my people she was teachin' me, by not preachin' to me
But speakin' to me, in a method that was leisurely
So easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool
'Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin', so why should I stand in her way?
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul
She said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
She said, "Afrocentricity was of the past"
So she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz
Now, black music is black music, and it's all good
I wasn't salty she was with the Boyz n the Hood
'Cause that was good for her, she was becomin' well-rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung

A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat, Com gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
If you don't check it, mm-mm, bust it, bust it

I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once The Man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin' about poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
Tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it, but I'm committed
(Girl, he's committed) But so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same, lettin' all these goofies do her
I see niggas slammin' her, and takin' her to the sewer
But I'ma take her back, hopin' that the shit stop
'Cause who I'm talkin' about, y'all, is hip-hop

To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Mainframe, yo, they gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, Com Sense is gonna drop, haha

I used to love H.E.R, uh-uh, uh, uh
I used to love H.E.R, uh-uh, uh, uh
I used to love H.E.R, uh-uh, uh, uh
I used to love H.E.R, uh-uh, uh, uh
I used to love H.E.R, uh-uh, uh, uh
I used to love H.E.R, uh-uh, uh, uh
I used to love H.E.R., went and fucked up all the shit, y'all, buss it

168 Contributors8 Mile Lyrics
It's alright, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Gonna make it, can't give up now
I'ma make it somehow

Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been 'vict'd
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)

I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryna regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryna chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, ‘cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryna do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But, yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back

You gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
‘Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army, tryna salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryna travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin', no, next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these Free World leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)

First to put it down for North Carolina
But guess what (what?), it's been worth it
I'm a superstar, bought me a big ol' car
Four point six (see the car!)
Black with the bars from the front to back
And got a button in the middle, make the trunk go "eh-eh"
But it ain't 'bout that
It's about getting what you getting and driving all back here
Big fellas (six fellas)
Half of me and Carolina niggas done time together
Polk, Bladen, Marshall, Hoke, Greene County, Tillery, damn
Transfer, Sandy Ridge, Browns over here (greens over here)
Pasqoutank, down on the, Odom East (let me think)
Johnson County, Franklin, Burgaw, Newport, Warren, Shelby, Kenansville

We used to (Rep our city, rep our city!)
Running through the school halls
Just before our basketball pep-rally jumped off
(hah!) My house, my home, my hood (hah!)
My brother, my sister, my cous' (hah!)
My niggas that was there from the beginning
Been wit me even 'fore they knew what bein' with me was
Y'all niggas just glanced at it, now I got y'all staring at it
But it's been the same ol' North Carolina it's been being
Y'all niggas just getting it, oh it's a shame isn't it?
Oh you thought we said we were coming wit a whole lotta something
We were bullshhh! (ahh!)

Man I had to do it
Just in case you were one of the ones
Who wanted to come and ask something stupid
(What you think you doin'?) What it look like?
Putting it down for my niggas in the south side
North Carolina, South Carolina
And all my little bitty overlooked hick towns
We gonna hit y'all asses, ain't nothing but a T. T. blast
What we got coming at you?
(Beats?) slamming, (verses?) classic
(Gold for this) What's after platinum?
(Baby you don't want the bomb)
And I don't meant to scare ya
But I'm about to bring it home
Blow these valleys, these hills, these streams
And N. C. outta the water
How's it feel to look a motherfucker dead in the grill
And tell 'em, "I told ya!"

===== Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz - Deja Vu (Uptown Baby) =====
44 ContributorsDeja Vu (Uptown Baby) Lyrics

New York to the heart, but got love for all
Lie and die in the fire, where I learned to ball
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome
On the streets of the Bronx where my family roam
Ho damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat
Splat, like deja vu
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Dom P, Mo' with pist-al
Just cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should misdoubt
Keep em near da fifties and, hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that, you keep the change
Not filthy rich, but bitch I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope
Friends call me Gunz, sons call me trife
Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her
I guarantee Peter, knows how to eat her
And beat her, niggas in the Bronx call me Lex
Cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex
And I lounge on Lex, and I love sex
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin to flex
Like Dex, nigga God rest your soul
But when you're playin cards for Gunz, it ain't no time to fold

New York niggas got crazy game
But outta town niggas is all the same
Brooklyn niggas get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot
Harlem niggas know how to play
Mack the 600, getting crazy pay
Niggas outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the Glock, running up in your spot

But if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)
Now if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)

Yo the RM-80, is parked in the lot
Right next to the Mercedes, keep the heat cocked
For these blocks that are shady, you're crazy if you walk around
Thinking shit's gravy; stop me? Maybe
I'm livin life lawless, makin big investments
On them 8-class flawless, and hoes call us
I'm comfortable like Recaro, two quarters of my life
Walkin roads type narrow, deep thoughts which I abide by
Puffin high, got my mind's eye, points sharper
Than an arrow gettin high, keep your eye on the sparrow
Riches like the pharaoh, bought a new five
With the snitches for these hoes, trunk full of ammo
Keep my toast closer than most niggas keep they own shadow
And I strap for my foes like a saddle
I rock stones, other niggas rock gravel
Talk shit? Whatever have you, I'm from Soundview
Bronx most wanted, front get confronted
Playa, we rollin deep in the one point five hundreds
Like Big I., red eyed, mad blunted
You step outside and get blooded have your whole block flooded
With the Bronx it's a warnin, stormin guns out
From dusk 'til dawn and it's on, no doubt
Keep a eye on yo' bitch when I'm roamin about
And put a eye on yo' lip nigga, watch yo' mouth
I'm from the Bronx, wipe yo' feet when you step in my house
Cause you's a small-time nigga, bout a half an ounce now

New York niggas got crazy game
But outta town niggas is all the same
Brooklyn niggas get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot
Harlem niggas know how to play
Mack the 600, getting crazy pay
Niggas outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the Glock, running up in your spot

But if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)
Now if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)

Uh, Peter Gunz like what
Uh, The Lord Tariq is like what

Yeah
And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
-Min' home again

I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, but
My name is Windy and I like to blow trees," and
From that point, I'd never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me"
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me"

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes, I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you," and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
Comin' home again
Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al

Ciudad de Nueva York, por favor trátame bien esta noche
Ciudad de Nueva York, por favor ten cuidado con este corazón mío (Que?)

Sí, mira, negro, esta es mi ciudad
Bienvenido a la ciudad de los dioses (Que?)
Pop era el rey de Nueva York, ahora soy el negro que realmente está a cargo
Solo los perforadores, la ciudad es nuestra
Descubrí a los oponentes, los separamos
Les doy mi tiempo, así quе les doy mi corazón
Si la ciudad me ama, entoncеs soy realmente una estrella (Que?)

Ciudad de Nueva York, por favor trátame bien esta noche
Ciudad de Nueva York, por favor ten cuidado con este corazón mío
Porque estoy perdiendo a mi amante en los brazos de otro
Ciudad de Nueva York, por favor trátame bien esta noche
Ciudad de Nueva York, por favor trátame bien

Sí, mira, esta es la ciudad del dinero y la violencia
Lo mismo que hagas vendrá con un desafío
Los negros van a venir con violencia (Qué?)
Cada tirador conmigo viene en silencio (Que?)
Mejor elige un lado (Mejor elige un lado), los negros elijen el lado hoppers (Estos negros elijen el lado hoppers)
Si quiero que no te dejen entrar a la ciudad, es mi opción (Bow)
Este es el hogar de la mosca Shaka (Sí)
Aquí es donde la perra va a ver los bolsillos (Sí)
Cuando estoy en la televisión, tengo que lucir bien, porque conozco a toda la cuadra mirando
Nos relajamos con los oponentes, no somos violentos
Si los veo en persona, los Fox 5
Pon a la policía sobre nosotros, no nos detendremos
(Pon a la policía sobre nosotros, no nos detendremos, no)
Este es el momento del gran goteo (Gran goteo), charla suave (Charla suave)
Milly Rock, Shmoney Dance (Shmoney Dance), Caminata Woo (Woo)
No sobreviviremos siendo demasiado blandos (No)
Ha pasado mucho tiempo, tomamos un nuevo mundo
Los tiradores disparan, así que tenemos una nueva causa
Si nos atascamos, dejaremos que se enfríe

Ciudad de Nueva York, por favor trátame bien esta noche
Ciudad de Nueva York, por favor ten cuidado con este corazón mío
Porque estoy perdiendo a mi amante en los brazos de otro
Ciudad de Nueva York, por favor trátame bien esta noche
Ciudad de Nueva York, por favor trátame bien

Nos salimos de la red (¿Qué?)
No miramos el trono, lo tomamos
Nos volvimos virales con ellos, se ven
Es un servicio dominical en Brooklyn (¿Que?)
Es la ciudad que viene con las luces
Estoy con los perforadores que vienen con la noche
No hacen cuatro años en la universidad, pero harán veinticinco en la vida
Ganamos dinero todas las noches (¿Qué?)
Nunca lo demasiado alto de un precio (¿Qué?)
Después de comprar los Chicago Bulls, me vincularé con Mike
Y les dejé tener a mi esposa, deberías agradecerme
Con este Balenciaga y botas de Balenci y un nuevo Yankee azul
Este es Ye, estoy tan concentrado, ponte una máscara, sin COVID
Voy a convertir tu vida en un meme y dejar que Justin LaBoy lo publique
Tienes un álbum, pospónlo
Lanzo dos y ambos se van
Tengo la sensación de que ellos están en sus sentimientos
Están filmando un programa, pero no lo mostrarán
Tienes que mirarme en cámara lenta, estoy en un Benz de cuerpo ancho
Vuelvo a la universidad, hago un álbum y luego lo dejo de nuevo
Me tomó un minuto llegar aquí, mi visión es clara como el cristal
Ayy, Fivio, disculpe, pero este es el feat del año
Siéntete como Sinatra en estas calles, yo y Drizzy, estamos en paz
Así es la mochila con el Polo y la primera pieza de Jesús
Soy de Chicago pero siempre seré de Nueva York
La ciudad que me trata como Jesús está caminando
He pasado por el dolor y todo el trauma
Estoy diciendo su nombre, lo hago importante (¿Qué?)
Ahora es el momento de darles un infierno
Pregúntale a mi personal, les pago bien
Esta tarde, cien matones llegan a SNL (¿Qué?)
Cuando me detengo, está muerto al llegar
Actúan como si te quisieran, ni siquiera les gustas
Hacen una fiesta, ni siquiera te invitan
Vi que le pasaba lo mismo a Michael
Negro y rico te dicen psicópata (¿Que?), es como un ciclo
Si me envías un mensaje de texto exagerado, será mejor que respondas y digas que es un error tipográfico
La ciudad de los dioses, ninguna ciudad es como tú
Esta es la nueva Nueva York, Ye es la cabra
Fivi es viral y esta es la B.I.B.L.I.A (¿Qué?)

Ciudad de Nueva York, por favor trátame bien esta noche (Pero que mierda?, que mierda?)
(Pero que mierda?) Ciudad de Nueva York, por favor ten cuidado con este corazón mío
Porque estoy perdiendo a mi amante en los brazos de otro
Ciudad de Nueva York, por favor trátame bien

No me abandones, trátame bien, trátame bien, trátame bien
No me abandones, trátame bien, trátame bien, trátame bien
No me abandones, no me abandones, no me abandones, no me abandones

Yeah, dirty words, dirty birds, it's mean in the Dirty South
If you ever disrespect it, then we'll clean out ya dirty mouth

I got five Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at ya Georgia dome

My small city's called Albany (Georgia!)
Hahaha, pecan country like catfish with grits
Candy yams and chitlins, grandma's homemade baked biscuits
The land of classical Caprices and Impalas and Super Sports
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia (Georgia! Hahaha)
I love the women out in L.A. and the shoppin' stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A but ain't nothin' like that GA red clay
Look on ya map, we right above Florida, next to 'Bama
Under that Carolina to Tennessee, you'll see (Georgia! Hahaha)
Where Gladys Knight took the midnight train
The birthplace of Martin Luther King
Where ass so plump and hips are thick
Where 'Llac trucks sittin' on twenty-sixes
Know where you goin' or you'll be lost
Found in these plumb trees in the South
These choppers'll tomahawk your top down here in (Georgia!)

Now I was born in the belly on the bottom of the map

Country as hell, they some warriors
Tote somethin' that spray same shape as Florida
Lookin' for me boy, you'll find me
Down in Dougherty County in a small city
Called Albany, Georgia (Georgia!)
Where they used to call us some bamas
And now they jockin the grammar
Watch your mouth 'less you out for some manner

Now you might come for vacation, leave on probation
Home of the strip club, known for the thick girls
Where the tricks put tips in the tip cup
For the thick chick in the thong with the big butt
Wanna get love? Won't be cheap, long money like Peachtree

Alright

Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named Quik
I come from the school of the sly, wicked, and the slick
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
'Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of my hometown
I'm throwin' down in the town, where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin' a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doin' nothin' but (claimin' my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doublin' up, and provin' to suckers that I can throw 'em
I'm passin' a natural ten, or four, or six, or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestylin', all the while, still profilin'
Never trickster, DJ Quikster steals the show
So, yeah, that's how I'm livin', I do as I please, you see
A younger brother that's up on reality
'Cause everybody knows, you have to be stompin'
If you're born and raised in Compton

(Born and raised)
(Born and raised)
(Born and raised)

(Born and raised in Compton)
(Born and raised)

(Where you from, fool?)
(Compton)

Now, Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see
But then, I found that it wasn't no place for me
'Cause way back in the day, somebody must of wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house, and cold stole my shit
They must of thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't going out like no sucker-ass clown
They found, they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, mothafucka, silly sucker-
Ass clucker, now you're duckin', 'cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gon' never be the same
'Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin' over
I really don't think I should have to explain it
Oh, yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin' no pain
Sometimes I have to wear the bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'CPT' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceasin' to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin' like this, and I'm comin' directly
'Cause suckers get dain-bramage if I'm doin' damage quite effectively
Rhymin' is a battlezone, and suckers have no hint
'Cause I'm a veteran from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
Kick it

You ready to do this, nigga?
You ready to come down here?
It's Virginia, nigga
We do this in broad daylight
That's a whole different degree of homicide, nigga
You ready?

I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (Talkin' 'bout what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple price, fuck the books (Talkin' 'bout what?)
Where we re-up, relocate, re-off them rooks (Talkin' 'bout what?)
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (Talkin' 'bout what?)

In my home sweet home, I keep chrome next to my bones
Alters my walk to limpin', since I love the feel
I guess I'm passionately pimpin', it is what it seems
That thing imprintin' through the seam of my jeans, by all means
Lost it all, from lives to love
But my faith and my money helped me rise above
See, I turned to the Lord when them times got tough
Bullied through the streets, powder I pushed and shoved
In that ol' Virginny, out of ten niggas, nine are guinea
No money, all they know is gimme
Got semis waitin', heat like Caribbean summers
I been there, each year, a different bitch wonder
Who wing she gon' fall under
Push' or Mal', Gonz or Grimes
With me, with thoughts of fuckin' them cross her mind
Look ma, that's right up my alley
I love my family, I want them all happy
In Virginia, we smirked at the Simpson trial
Yeah, I guess the chase was wild, but what's the fuss about?
See, plenty my partners feelin' like OJ
Beat murder like the shit is okay, that's what our dough say
Talk the evil that men do, I'm lost in the mental
I miss you Shampoo, we miss you Shampoo
And your grams too

I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (Talkin' 'bout what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple price, fuck the books (Talkin' 'bout what?)
Where we re-up, relocate, re-off them rooks (Talkin' 'bout what?)
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (Talkin' 'bout what?)
I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (Talkin' 'bout what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple price, fuck the books (Talkin' 'bout what?)
Where we re-up, relocate, re-off them rooks (Talkin' 'bout what?)
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (Talkin' 'bout what?)

Seem like they all got a comment to make
In regards to my paper, now they guessin' my weight
They fast to predict the outcome of my fate
Wonderin' 'bout Clipse and if they got what it take
"Malice, he think he hard, tough guy of the clique
And Pusha, he walk around like he swear he the shit"
You right on both counts, bitch, Clipse is us
And there are some things that you don't discuss
Don't ask me 'bout the Neptunes and what's they fare
Don't ask about the loud screamin' chick with the hair
Don't ask about my music and how that's comin' 'bout
Don't ask about my album, or when's it comin' out
'Cause I feel like you really being funny on the sly
Now face down, layin' on your tummy or you die
I tried being humble, humble get no respect
Now the first sign of trouble, that's a hole up in your neck
Plus what I look like spendin' my nights in jail?
I could never be a thug, they don't dress this well
I reside in VA, ride in VA
Most likely when I die, I'm gon' die in VA
Virginia's for lovers, but trust there's hate here
For out-of-towners who think that they gon' move weight here
Ironic, the same place I'm makin' figures at
That there's the same land they used to hang niggas at, in Virginia

I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (Talkin' 'bout what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple price, fuck the books (Talkin' 'bout what?)
Where we re-up, relocate, re-off them rooks (Talkin' 'bout what?)
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (Talkin' 'bout what?)
I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (Talkin' 'bout what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple price, fuck the books (Talkin' 'bout what?)
Where we re-up, relocate, re-off them rooks (Talkin' 'bout what?)
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (Talkin' 'bout what?)

Youngin (Talkin' 'bout what?)
This is real, youngin (Talkin' 'bout what?)
You lookin' into a whole different world, youngin (Talkin' 'bout what?)
This is real
Live

===== OutKast - West Savannah =====
62 ContributorsWest Savannah Lyrics
Yeah, I’m back off in this bitch one more time
To drop this rhyme, about where my roots at
Yeah, Westside is in the house
Frazier Homes is in the house
Cloverdale is in the house
And Savannah, GA is in the house, so check it…

February 1st, 1975 – it happened
Was born in West Savannah, way before I started rappin'
My mama had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin' that sack, now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
And she couldn't watch my every move, so, shit, I started servin'
Around Frazier Home, down in the Westside projects
Changin' over food stamps, and hittin' a lick, was next
See, I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin', or floatin', a Brougham is what I'm sportin'
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm moving in slow motion, boi
So meet me deep in the streets, that's where I learned the capers
Us lickin' blunts, lickin' leaves, rolling reefer papers
I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the ave, and the hoes, they love me (Yeah)
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin' cable off in every room
So follow the fiends, follow my lead, through the nooks and crannies
It's everyday life off in my hood, so come and holla at me
But go 'head on, with that foolishness, bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve, because I'm true to this shit
And if you coming with eight dollars, you shit out of luck
Because the Westside ain't taking no shorts on the dime
So fire it up

Now, now, now – nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(Like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)
Nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(And it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)

See, niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doing it for years, so these niggas ain't gone change
They coming around the ghetto, so you might call 'em soul
Been wearing furry Kangol's, so that shit is old
You might slang a rock or two, just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance, so now your money's spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
As long as there's that "tic-tic" followed by that "bump"
I'm down to stick a ho if she got a G-string
'Cause the niggas in the Point ain't changed, man
You might call us country, but we's only Southern
And I don't give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another
Now, now, now – nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(Like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)
Nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(And it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)
Now, now, now – nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(Like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)
Nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(And it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)
Now, now, now – nine in my hand, ounce in my crotch
Diggin' the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(Like that now, like this, and it don't quit, and it don't stop)

Hold on, I'm 'bout to call my girl
Man, see, how weak yo game is?
Shut up, you ain't even got one, shut up
Hello?
Wassup?
Wassup?
Get yo ass in here!
I gotta go
Hold up
Mark wants- Mark wanna know if he can get some cut-up
Some cut-up?! {*record scratch*}
Ain't no cut-up going here, I'll cut y'all ass up!
