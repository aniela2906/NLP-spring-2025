===== Michael Jackson - Billie Jean =====
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh), hey-ey
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Don't break no hearts; hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo), hey-ey
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee-hee, ah, hee-hee-hee)
She says I am the one, uh
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no, hoo, ohh)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (You know what you did to me, baby)
No-no-no (No-no-no, ah), no-no-no-no (No-no-no)
She says I am the one (No)
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no)
She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breakin' my heart, babe)
She says I am the one
Yeah, yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl)
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl; don't call me Billie Jean, hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl; she's not at the scene)
Billie Jean is not (Hee), aaow, ooh
Yeah, Billie Jean is

===== Michael Jackson - Smooth Criminal =====
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
You've been hit by—
A smooth criminal
Ow!
So they came in to the out way
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
He's leaving no clues left behind him
And he had no way of knowing
Of the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?
Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been struck by—
Choo-cha, choo-cha
Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!
It was your doom, Annie 
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie 
He came into your apartment, 

===== Michael Jackson - Rock with you =====
Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
We're gonna rock the night away (Rock, right)
Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go
When you feel that heat
And we gonna ride the boogie
And when the groove is dead and gone (Yeah)
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever on
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you

===== Michael Jackson - Thriller =====
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller, ow
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (thriller night, babe)
The foulest stench's in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
Are closing in to seal your doom (oh, yeah)
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
There ain't no second chance against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (ooh-ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a
Killer, thriller, killer, thriller here tonight
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul would ever dare try
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow

===== Michael Jackson - Man in the Mirror =====
I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh, yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ohh yeah!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man, you know, that man)
(Well I'll change!)
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!
Hoo, hoo (Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na), hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Gonna feel real good (Oh, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na)
Yeah, yeah, oh no, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, hoo!
(Man in the mirror) You've got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You've got to, you got to move, shamone, shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah), stand up (Make that change), stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Aaow! (Yeah, make that change)
Go make that change, shamone (Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)
Make that change

He wouldn't let this be, no, no

===== Michael Jackson - Chicago =====
Ah, I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I, so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me
She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home, she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah
I never woulda thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me, this girl, she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me
She said she didn’t have no man (Ah, ah)
Raised the kids the very best she can (Look, she's lovin' me)
Said at home, she didn't have no phone (She was lovin' me)
Fifty-nine was the code she gave
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Look who's lovin' me)
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife (She was wantin' me)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was lovin' me)
She said like it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can (She was wantin' me)
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah
Woah-oh-oh, no
Alright
Oh, I'm in love, love
I didn't know she was already spoken for
'Cause I'm not that kind of man
Swear that I would've never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I'm holdin' her to blame
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (Holdin' her to blame)
Said at home, she didn't have no phone (Holdin' her to blame)
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (Holdin' her to blame)
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Holdin' her to blame)
Loving me while she was still your wife (Holdin' her to blame)
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (Holdin' her to blame)
Tried to keep me any way she can (Holdin' her to blame)
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (She's with me)

===== Michael Jackson - Dirty Diana =====
You'll never make me stay, so take your weight off of me
I know your every move, so won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before, but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time, you won't seduce me
She's saying "That's okay, hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want, I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes, she's touching me so to start
She says "There's no turning back", she trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
(Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no)
She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She's saying "That's okay, hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far
I'll be your everything if you make me a star"
Dirty Diana
Diana, Diana
It's Diana, -iana, -iana
C'mon!
No, no, oh-, stop this
She said "I have to go home, 'cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone, why don't you come with me?"
I said "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright"
Diana walked up to me, she said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that, I ran to the phone saying, "Baby, I'm alright"
I said "But unlock the door, 'cause I forgot the key"
She said "He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me"
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana) (Hey, hey)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana, no) (Hey, baby, won't you-)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana) (Hey, baby, won't you-)
C'mon! Aaow! (Dirty Diana, no)
C'mon! (Dirty Diana)

===== Michael Jackson - Black or White =====
(Hey!) What?
(Turn it off) But dad, this is the best part!
(Turn it off) No!
(It's too late for this, turn it off)
Dad, this is the best part, come on
(No, turn it off now) No, this is the—, I wanna listen to it, okay?
('Cause it's too loud and disturbs the neighbors, turn it off now)
Right, too late? Sure, eat this
Aaow! (Ooh)
Aaow!
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, ooh
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em, "I ain't second to none"
And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right, hee
It don't matter if you're black or white, hoo
Gone wit' ya, babe
Hee-hee
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Go when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Go when the going gets mean
Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from, it's where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life being a color
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye (Hee-hee)
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
Alright, alright (Ooh-ooh)
Alright (Yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah, now
Shamone, don't (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, now, alright, ah
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to beat, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white (It's white)
It's black, it's white, hoo!

===== Michael Jackson - Heal the World =====
Think about, um, the generations and, uh, say we wanna make it a better place for our children and our children's children, so that they, they, they s—they know it's a better world for them, and think if they can make it a better place...
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
Make a better place for you and for me
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
So make a better world
And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
To make a better place
Make it a better place (Better place)
Heal the world (Heal the world)
For you and for me and the entire human race (Oh, no)
There are people dying (Oh)
(Yeah) There are people dying (Oh)
(Then) Make a better place for you and for me
(Everyone, there are) There are people dying (Oh)
(You and for me) Make a better place
(You and for me) Heal the world we live in
(You and for me) Save it for our children

===== Michael Jackson - Human Nature =====
Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
Tell 'em that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
Just tell 'em that it's human nature
(She's giving in by keeping him a-round)
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
(That way) Why? Oh, why?
Looking out across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em!
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?), why (Why?)
Cha-da-cha-sha-sha-sha-sha-sha (Aah-ah)
If they say why (Why? Why?), why (Why? Why? Why?)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em! (Aah-ah)
Ooh, tell 'em!
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? (That way)

===== Michael Jackson - Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' =====
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothin' he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
To keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin' (Hee)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
Still, they hate you (Still, they hate you)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet) (You're a vegetable)
They eat off of you (They eat off of you) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable, aaow!
Billie Jean is always talkin' when nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Talkin', squealin', spyin'
You're a vegetable, ow!
Ow!
Yee-haw! (Ooh!)
If you can't feed your baby 
Then don't have a baby 
And don't think maybe 
You'll be always tryin'
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustlin', stealin', lyin'
Now, baby's slowly dyin'
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder
Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
"I know I am someone," and let the truth unfurl (Hee-ha)
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so you believe in you
Help me sing it
Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa

===== Michael Jackson - I Just Can't Stop Loving You =====
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
This time is forever, love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now, the love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps and angels sing
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living if I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
'Cause I just can't stop loving you
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true (Mmm)
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel (Ah), I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do" (I do)
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living if I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you (Woah-oh)
I just can't stop loving you (If I stop)
And if I stop (Uh-huh)
Then tell me just what will I do (Woah-oh)
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I want to see you for always
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby, oh)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop (Oh, oh)
Then tell me just what will I do (Oh, oh, what will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Hee-hee-hee, love you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (I know I do)
And if I stop (Oh, oh, oh)

===== Taylor Swift - Lover =====
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my

===== Taylor Swift - Cardigan =====
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levis
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothin'
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in 20 lifetimes, I
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

===== Taylor Swift - Blank space =====
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ay
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh, my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
'Cause we're young, and we're reckless (oh)
It'll leave you breathless, mm (oh)
They'll tell you I'm insane (insane)
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
You can tell me when it's over (over)
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
'Cause we're young, and we're reckless (yeah)
We'll take this way too far (ooh)
Or with a nasty scar (leave a nasty scar)

===== Taylor Swift - Cruel Summer =====
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh
It's new, the shape of your body
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

===== Taylor Swift - Anti-Hero =====
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
And life will lose all its meaning
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from Hell"
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees
It's me, hi (Hi)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)

===== Taylor Swift - Shake It Off =====
I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mm-mm
I go on too many dates (Haha)
But I can't make them stay
At least, that's what people say, mm-mm
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
I never miss a beat
I'm lightnin' on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mm-mm
That's what they don't see, mm-mm
I'm dancin' on my own (Dancin' on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mm-mm
That's what they don't know, mm-mm
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
Hey, hey, hey
Just think, while you've been gettin' down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been gettin' down
To this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, "Oh my God," but I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh-oh, oh
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (Haters gonna hate)
I shake it off, I shake it off (Ha)
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (Mmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (They fake and fake and fake)
I shake it off, I shake it off (I, I)
I, I, I shake it off (Yeah), I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (You got to)

===== Taylor Swift - august =====
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you
But I can see us lost in the memory
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"
(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car")
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
("Meet me behind the mall")
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

===== Taylor Swift - Style =====
Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm, yeah
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl
He says, "What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I"
I said, "I've been there too a few times"
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go), we never go out of style
Take me home (Ah)
Just take me home (Ah)
Yeah, just take me home (Ah)
Oh-oh, woah-oh, oh (Out of style)
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And when we go crashing down (And when we go), we come back every time

===== Taylor Swift - Don’t Blame Me =====
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Somethin' happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacin', I just need you
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time"
Oh Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
My name is whatever you decide and
I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes (Echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo hidin' my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now, I'm your daisy
And, baby, for you, I (I) would (Would) fall from grace
Just (Just) to (To) touch your face
If (If) you (You) walk away
I'd beg ya on my knees to stay
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (Yeah, ooh)
I get so high, oh
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh, woah)
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right, no)
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (Oh)
Don't blame me, love made me crazy (Ooh)
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it right)
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

===== Taylor Swift - Look What You Made Me Do =====
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
I (I) don't (Don't) like your kingdom keys (Keys)
They (They) once belonged to me (Me)
You (You) asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time (Nick of time)
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time (I do it all the time)
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starrin' in your bad dreams
(Ooh, look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)
(Look what you just made me)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now"
"Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead" (Oh)

===== Taylor Swift - Delicate =====
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best
(Yeah, I want you) We can't make
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
Sometimes, I wonder, when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes, when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine all the damn time
('Cause I like you)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)
Is it chill that you're in my head? (Isn't it? Isn't it?)
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Isn't it delicate?)
Is it too soon to do this yet? (Isn't it? Isn't it?)
Isn't it delicate?

===== Taylor Swift - Wildest Dreams =====
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Follow (Follow) you (You) around
(Follow you around)
Standing in a nice dress
Even if it's just pretend
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha

===== Taylor Swift - You Need To Calm Down =====
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?

===== Taylor Swift - All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault] =====
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

===== Taylor Swift - Love Story =====
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
Oh, oh
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'"
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

===== Taylor Swift - willow =====
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
They count me out time and time again
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man

===== Taylor Swift - I Knew You Were Trouble =====
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now, I see, now, I see
Now, I see-e-e-e-e
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Yeah, trouble)
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)

===== Taylor Swift - ME! =====
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kinda guy the ladies want
(And there's a lotta cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lotta lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Let me keep you company
Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up, one, two, three
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
You're the only one of you (Oh)
Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm the only one of me (Oh-oh)
(Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
You can't spell "awesome" without "me"
You're the only one of you (Yeah, yeah)

===== Taylor Swift - Karma =====
You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that
Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)
'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me
'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god (Ah)
Uh-huh, mm

===== Britney Spears - Oops!...I Did It Again =====
Mmm, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh, baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Ooh, baby, baby
Oops, I did it again, I played with your heart
Got lost in the game, oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love, that I'm sent from above

Wishin' that heroes, they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways?
But to lose all my senses
Oh, baby, oh
"All aboard!"
"Britney! Before you go, there's something I want you to have."
"Oh, it's beautiful! But wait a minute, isn't this...?"
"Yeah, yes, it is."
"But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end."
"Well, baby, I went down and got it for ya."
"Aw, you shouldn't have"
Oops, I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh, baby (Baby)

===== Britney Spears - Baby One More Time =====
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now
Oh, because
My loneliness is killin' me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
The reason I breathe is you (Oh yeah)
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
How was I supposed to know?
I must confess that my loneliness is killin' me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here and give me a sign?
I must confess that my loneliness (My loneliness is killin' me)
Is killin' me now (I must confess, I still believe)
Don't you know I still believe (When I'm not with you, I lose my mind)

===== Britney Spears - Gimme More =====
It's Britney, bitch

And I just wanna dance with you
Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
Public display of affection (Oh-oh-oh)
Feels like no one else in the room (But you)
We can get down

We keep on rocking (We keep on rocking)

===== Britney Spears - Toxic =====
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?
Taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under (toxic)
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now

===== Britney Spears - Womanizer =====
Superstar, where you from? How's it goin'?
I know you got a clue what you're doin'
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby
Look at you, gettin' more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, you-you are, you, you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you are, a-are
(You, you) You got me goin', you're oh-so-charmin'
(You, you) But I can't do it, you womanizer
(You, you) You say I'm crazy, I got your crazy
(You, you) You're nothin' but a womanizer
Daddy-o, you got the swagger of a champion
Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many
Makes it hard, it could be easy
Who you are, that's just who you are, baby
Lollipop, must mistake me, you're the sucker
To think that I would be a victim, not another
Say it, play it how you wanna
But no way, I'm never gonna
Fall for you, never you, baby
You, you-you are, you, you-you are (Womanizer, womanizer)
Maybe if we both lived in a different world, yeah
(Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer)
It would be all good and maybe I could be your girl (Yeah)
But I can't 'cause we don't, you

===== Britney Spears - Circus =====
There's only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well, baby, I'm a put-on-a-show kinda girl
Don't like the backseat, gotta be first (Oh, oh)
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (Call the shots)
I'm like a firecracker, I make it hot
When I put on a show
I feel the adrenaline movin' through my veins
Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break
I'm like a performer, the dance floor is my stage
Better be ready, hope that you feel the same
All eyes on me in the center of the ring
Just like a circus
When I crack that whip, everybody gon' trip
Don't stand there watchin' me, follow me
Show me what you can do
Everybody let go, we can make a dance floor
There's only two types of guys out there
Ones that can hang with me and ones that are scared
So, baby, I hope that you came prepared
I run a tight ship, so beware
I'm like the ringleader, I call the shots (I call the shots)
Let's go
Let me see what you can do
I'm runnin' this (Like-like-like-like a circus)
Yeah, like a what? (Like-like-like-like a circus)

===== Britney Spears - My Only Wish (This Year) =====
Oh, yeah, yeah
Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa, can you hear me?
I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, it just said this:
"I know exactly what I want this year"
I want my baby, baby
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (Maybe, maybe)
He'll be all my own in a big red bow
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing:
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year
Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep
Would I be wrong for taking a peek?
'Cause I heard that you're coming to town
I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh, please make my wish come true
I want my baby, baby (Oh)
We'll be all the love under the mistletoe
And all I want is one thing
I hope my letter reaches you in time, oh yeah
Bring me love I can call all mine, oh yeah yeah
'Cause I have been so good, so good this year
Can't be alone under the mistletoe

He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
The man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Oh-oh, I know, oh
Should've let go, but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And he's got my name
Tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm
So I guess it's okay
He's with me
And I hear people talk (People talk)
Try to make remarks, keep us apart
But I don't even hear
I don't care
'Cause mama, I'm in love with a criminal
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy (I love the guy)
(Oh-oh, I know, oh) Mama, I'm in love with a criminal

===== Britney Spears - Sometimes =====
You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close, I move away
I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know
Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right
Be with you day and night
Baby, all I need is time
I don't wanna be so shy, uh-oh
Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me
Sometimes I run (Sometimes)
All I really want is to hold you tight
I'll just hang around and you'll see
There's nowhere I'd rather be
If you love me, trust in me

Sometimes I'm scared of you (Ooh, oh)
But all I really want is to hold you tight (Hold you tight)

===== Britney Spears - I Wanna Go =====
Lately, I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out
Shame on me
To need release
Un-un-uncontrollably
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt I got running through my mind, woah
Lately, people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
I've been told just what to do with it
To keep both my hands above the bla-blanket
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow all the di-i-irt I got running through my  mind, woah
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame on me (Shame on me)
To need release (To need release)
Un-un-un-uncontrollably (Uncontrollably, -lably, -lably, -lably...)
I-I-I wanna go-oh-oh (I wanna go...) all the way-ay-ay
I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow (I wanna show...) all the di-i-irt I got running through my mind

===== Britney Spears - Till the World Ends =====
(Aw)
This kitten got your tongue tied in knots, I see
Spit it out, 'cause I'm dying for company
I notice that you got it, you notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
If you want this good -ish, sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ, what you, what you waiting for?
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Watch me move, when I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch, dancin' in the dark
You notice what I'm wearin', I'm noticin' you starin'
Hotter than the A-list, next one on my hit list
DJ, what you, what you waitin' for?
See the sunlight, we ain't stoppin'
Keep on dancin' 'til the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen

===== Britney Spears - Everytime =====
Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?
Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy
And every time I try to fly, I fall
I see your face, you're haunting me
I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry
Ooh
At night, I pray
That soon your face will fade away

===== Britney Spears - Lucky =====
This is a story about a girl named Lucky
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say
"She's so lucky, she's a star"
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
"If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?
"Best actress, and the winner is, Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News, standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"
"Oh my God, here she comes!"
Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?

===== Britney Spears - Stronger =====
Ooh, hey, yeah
Hush, just stop
There's nothing you can do or say (Baby)
I've had enough
I'm not your property as from today (Baby)
You might think that I won't make it
On my own
But now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I, I'm stronger
Than I ever thought that I could be (Baby)
I used to go with the flow
Didn't really care 'bout me
You might think that I can't take it
But you're wrong
'Cause now I'm stronger than yesterday
Come on now
Oh, yeah
Here I go, on my own
I don't need nobody, better off alone
Here I go, on my own now
I don't need nobody, not anybody
Here I go (Here I go, here I go, here I go...)
Alright
(Here I go, here I go, here I go) Here I go
Stronger than yesterday
It’s nothing but my way
I, I'm stronger than yesterday
And I'm stronger than yesterday
My loneliness ain't killing me no more (No more)
(I'm) I, I'm stronger

===== Britney Spears - Piece of Me =====
Oh

You want a piece of me? (You want a piece of me?)

Now, for real, are you kiddin' me?

===== Lady Gaga - Shallow =====
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?
I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?
I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh-ah, ha
In the sha-ha, shallow

===== Lady Gaga - Die With A Smile =====
(Ooh, ooh)
I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for
Right next to you
Next to you
Oh-oh

===== Lady Gaga - Poker Face =====

And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh

(Mum-mum-mum-mah)
I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be (Woo)
A little gamblin' is fun when you're with me (I love it, woo)
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby, when it's love, if it's not rough, it isn't fun, fun
I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lyin', I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous

===== Lady Gaga - Always Remember Us This Way =====
That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul

You found the light in me that I couldn't find
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons
If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay
Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
Hey, ehh, ehh, eyy
Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay, ehh, ehhy
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one
When I bow down to pray
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay

===== Lady Gaga - Telephone =====
Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service in the club, you say, say? (Say)
Wha-wha-what did you say, huh? You're breakin' up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
K-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy), k-kinda busy (I'm kinda busy)
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy
Just a second, it's my favorite song they're gonna play (Play)
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop callin' me, I'm kinda busy
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephonin' me)
I'm busy
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (Stop telephonin' me)
Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone (No)
Out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone (Phone)
Won't make me leave no faster (Pu-put)
Put my coat on faster (Le-leave)
Leave my girls no faster
I should've left my phone at home
'Cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer
It's not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringin'
Sometimes I feel like I live in GrandCentral S-Station (Station)
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin'
('Cause tonight I'm dancin', dancin')
'Cause I'll be dancin' ('Cause tonight I'm dancin', dancin')
'Cause I'll be dancin' ('Cause tonight I'm dancin')
Stop telephonin' me, eh, eh eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh (I'm busy)
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub

We're sorry, we're sorry
The number you have reached is not in service at this time
Please check the number or try your call again

===== Lady Gaga - Judas =====
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga
When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times, he betrays me
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
A king with no crown, king with no crown
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
I've learned love is like a brick, you can
Build a house or sink a dead body
Ew
In the most Biblical sense (Ew)
I am beyond repentance
Fame, hooker, prostitute, wench
Vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense
I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offenced
Or wear ear condom next time
I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue
And Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to
Just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel (Just a Holy Fool, woah-oh-oh)
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah)
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as (Juda-a-as)

===== Lady Gaga - Paparazzi =====
We are the crowd, we're c-comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastico
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I
I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine (Yeah-ha)
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rockstar in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt, yellow, dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry, it don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
Real good, we dance in the studio
Snap, snap to that shit on the radio
Don't stop for anyone
We're plastic, but we still have fun

===== Lady Gaga - Born This Way =====
It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital "H-I-M" (M, M, M, M)
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Right track, baby
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be (Don't be, don't be)
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M, hey-hey-hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (Same DNA)
(Way)
Don't be, don't be, don't be, d—
Church
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, chola descent
You're Lebanese, you're Orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause baby, you were born this way
No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgender life
I was born to survive
No matter black, white, or beige
Chola or Orient made
I was born to be brave
'Cause God makes no mistakes ('Cause God makes no mistakes)
I'm on the right track, baby (Right track, baby)
Just love yourself and you're set (Love yourself and you're set)
I was born this way, yeah
I was born this way, hey (Hey)
I was born this way, hey (I was born this way, hey)
I was born this way, hey (Born this way, hey)
I was born this way, hey
Same DNA (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
But born this way (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
But born this way (Hey, hey, hey)

===== Lady Gaga - Applause =====
I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "Is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an IV, baby, could I bear
Being away from you? I found the vein, put it in here
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
I've overheard your theory, "Nostalgia's for geeks"
I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture, in me
Ooh-woo, touch, touch
Ooh-woo, touch, touch now
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
A-R-T-P-O-P

===== Lady Gaga - Bloody Mary =====
Money
Love is just a history that they may prove
And when you're gone, I'll tell them my religion's you
When Punktious comes to kill the king upon his throne
I'm ready for their stones
I'll dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands, hands
Above my head, head, head
Like Jesus said
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance
With my hands, hands
Hands above my head, hands together
Forgive him before he's dead because
I won't cry for you
I won't crucify the things you do
I won't cry for you, see (See)
When you're gone, I'll still be Bloody Mary
Love
We are not just art for Michelangelo to carve
He can't rewrite the aggro of my furied heart
I'll wait on mountaintops in Paris, cold
J'e veux pas mourir toute seule
Gaga, Gaga
Dum, dum, da-di-da
Dittie-da-di-da
I won't crucify the things you do, do, do
Oh (Gaga)
Liberdade e amor

===== Lady Gaga - Alejandro =====
"I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro"
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
She's got both hands
In her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love
En su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
"Stop, please
Just let me go
Alejandro, just let me go"
She's not broken
She's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that
Burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad
Don't bother me, don't bother me
Bye, Fernando
(Don't call my name, don't call my name) Alejandro, Alejandro

(I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe) Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

===== Lady Gaga - Stupid Love =====
You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me

We got a stupid love, love (Love, love, oh)

===== Lady Gaga - I’ll Never Love Again (Film Version) =====
Wish I could
I could have said goodbye
I would have said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew it would be the last time
I would have broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you
Don't want to feel another touch
Don't want to start another fire
Don't want to know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't want to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love again
I'll never love again
Oh, oh, oh
Oh
When we first met
I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself lyin' in your arms
Mmmm mmmm
And I wanna pretend that it's not true oh baby that you're gone
Cause my world keeps turnin' and turnin' and turnin' and I'm not movin' on
No I'll never love
I don't wanna know this feeling unless it's you and me
I don't wanna waste a moment
Hoooo ouuu
And I don't wanna give somebody else the better part of me
I would rather wait for you
Baby unless they are your lips
Don't let another day begin
Won't let the sunlight in
Oh I'll never love again
Never love again

So sweet, then I get a little angry, yeah
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm super psycho
Make you crazy when I turn the lights low
Sour candy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ask me to be nice, and then I'll do it extra mean

비싼 척이란 말들로 날 포장한 건 너야, 너야
If you wanna fix me, then let's break up here and now
거리낌 없는 눈빛에 넌 거릴 두니까
툭 까보면 어김없이 소리질러와
Uh-huh, uh-huh (Oh)
I'm hard on the outside
But if you give me time
Then I could make time for your love
But if you see inside, inside, inside
I might be messed up
But I know what's up
You want a real taste
At least I'm not a fake
Come, come, unwrap me

===== Lady Gaga - The Cure =====
I'll undress you 'cause you're tired
Cover you as you desire
When you fall asleep inside my arms
May not have the fancy things
But I'll give you everything
You could ever want, it's in my arms
So baby, tell me "yes"
And I will give you everything
And I will be all yours tonight

Hush now baby, don't you cry
Anything you want could not be wrong
(I'll fix you with my love-lo-love)

===== Justin Bieber - Sorry =====
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

===== Justin Bieber - Love Yourself =====
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

===== Justin Bieber - Ghost =====
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know
That if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know
That if I can't be close to you
I miss you more than life (Yeah)
Your memory is ecstasy (Oh)
Woah
Na-na-na
More than life (Oh)
So if I can't get close to you

Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn’t hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa

Hand in my hand because I'm yours, I can't
I can’t pretend, I can't ignore, you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh
Done bein' distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (Oh)
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine

And just shake me till you wake me from this bad dream (Yo, uh-huh)
I'm goin' down (Yo), down, down, down (Uh-huh)
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around, and I'm like
I thought you'd always be mine, mine (Luda!)
When I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby, and nobody came between us nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy, oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks (Woo)
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing 'cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'
I'm gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Gone, gone, gone, gone), I'm gone

===== Justin Bieber - Lonely =====
Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid

===== Justin Bieber - Mistletoe =====
(Let's go)
It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreadin' so much cheer
I should be playin' in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop starin' at your face
(With you) Shawty, with you
(With you) Shawty, with you (Yeah, you know?)
(With you) Under the mistletoe
Everyone's gatherin' around the fire
Chestnuts roastin' like a hot July
I should be chillin' with my folks, I know
Word on the street, Santa's comin' tonight
Reindeers flyin' through the sky so high
I should be makin' a list, I know
(With you) Under the mistletoe (Yeah)
(With you) Shawty, with you (Oh)
Hey, love
The wise men followed a star (The wise men followed a star)
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Hey, love (Hey, love)
Don't you buy me nothin' (Don't you buy me nothin')
'Cause I am feelin' one thing
Your lips on my lips
That's a merry, merry Christmas
I should be playin' in the winter snow (I know)
(With you) Shawty, with you (Oh, yeah)
(With you) Under the mistletoe (Under the mistletoe)
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe (Kiss me underneath the mistletoe)
Show me, baby, that you love me so (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Oh, oh, oh (Yeah)
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe (Kiss me under the mistletoe)
Show me, baby, that you love me so (Oh, woah)
Oh, oh, oh (Oh, woah, mm-mm-mm-mm)

===== Justin Bieber - Yummy =====
Yeah, you got that yummy-yum
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy
Say the word, on my way
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe
Any night, any day
Say the word, on my way
In the mornin' or the late
Bona fide stallion
Ain't in no stable, no, you stay on the run
Ain't on the side, you're number one
Yeah, every time I come around, you get it done
Fifty-fifty, love the way you split it
Hundred racks, help me spend it, babe
Light a match, get litty, babe
That jet set, watch the sunset kinda, yeah, yeah
Rollin' eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah
Any night, any day
Standin' up, keep me on the rise
Lost control of myself, I'm compromised
You're incriminating, no disguise
And you ain't never runnin' low on supplies
That yummy-yum, that yummy-yummy (You stay flexin' on me)
Yeah, you got that yummy-yum (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, babe, yeah, babe, yeah, babe (Yeah, babe)
Hop in the Lambo', I'm on my way
Drew House slippers on with a smile on my face
I'm elated that you are my lady
You got the yum, yum, yum, yum
You got the yum, yum-yum, woah
Woah-ooh

===== Justin Bieber - Holy =====
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper)
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
Can't wait another second, on God
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy

===== Justin Bieber - Hold On =====
You know you can call me if you need someone
I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone
Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone (Someone)
Feels to be someone who loses their way
You're looking for answers in a place unknown
You need the connection but you can't get close (Can't get close)
I need you to hold on (Hold on)
Heaven is a place not too far away (Away, yeah)
Take my hand and hold on (Oh, oh, oh-woah, oh-woah)
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone
Midnight 'til morning
Call if you need somebody
I will be there for you (I will be there for you)
I will be there for you
Take my hand and hold on (Hold on)
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone (Ooh, yeah)
I will be there for you (Oh, yeah, yeah)

Eenie-meenie-miney-mo

===== Mariah Carey - All i want for christmass =====
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
Yeah
There is just one thing I need (and I)
Don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (and I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
Oh-oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air (oh, oh, yeah)
And everyone is singing (oh, yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own

===== Mariah Carey - We Belong Together =====
Sweet love, yeah
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I shoulda held on tight, I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothin', I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lyin' to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt
The feelin' that I'm feelin' now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lyin' by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby (We belong together)
When you left, I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
(Come back, come back, come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? (Who else)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singin' to me, "If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryna catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, "I only think of you"
And it's breakin' my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm fallin' apart
I'm feelin' all out of my element
Throwin' things, cryin'
Tryna figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feelin' inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)
(We belong together)
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby
(We belong together) (Who will?)
When you left, I lost a part of me (Who will?)
It's still so hard to believe (Who will?)
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)
Who's gon' talk to me 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)
Who's gon' take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)
(Who will? Who will? Who will?)
We belong together

===== Mariah Carey - Obsessed =====

So, oh, oh-oh-oh (Ay, ay, ay)

So, oh, oh-oh-oh (Place to be)
So, oh, oh-oh-oh (MC, the MC)
All up in the blogs saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping
Ooh-oh, woah
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me, oh
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
See right through you like you're bathing in Windex
Oh, oh, oh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
So, oh, oh-oh-oh (Oh)

So, oh, oh-oh-oh

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Obsessed)
You on your job, you hating hard
Ain't gon' feed you, I'ma let you starve
Grasping for air, I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waiting
Telling the world how much you miss me
But we never were, so why you tripping?
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference, you a conversation
Ooh, woah, woah, woah
Why you so obsessed with me? And boy, I wanna know
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this
Boy, you're losing your mind (Mind)
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know?
Why you wasting your time? (Time)
So, oh, oh-oh-oh (Ooh)
(Hey, he's all up in my George Foreman)
(Lying that you're sexing Mimi)
It's clear that you're upset with me, oh (Eh)
Last man on the earth, still couldn't get this (No)
You're delusional, you're delusional (Ah)
(He's all up in my George Foreman)
(But I can't do nothing for him)
(You love me, you love me, you really, really love me)

===== Mariah Carey - Fantasy =====
Sha-do-do-do-do
Sha-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Mmm, baby, I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
(And I want you so badly)
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
Oh, oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping
Oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby

===== Mariah Carey - Always Be My Baby =====
Do do doop dum
Do do doop do doop da dum
Do do doop dum (Oh ah ah yeah yeah)
Do do doop do do do
Do do doop dum (Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)
We were as one, babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, babe
Our love will never die, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Do do doop do doop da dum (Yes, you will)
I ain't gonna cry, no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave, boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably
You'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart, babe
Our love will never end, no
I know that you'll be back, boy
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder, oh
I know that you'll be right back, baby
Oh, baby, believe me, it's only a matter of time, time
And we'll linger on (And we will linger on and on)
No way you're never gonna shake me (Ooh baby)
(You and I) And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong (You and I)
No way you're never going to shake me (you and I)
You and I will always be

===== Mariah Carey - Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) =====
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Ooh, yeah, yeah
(Christmas) The snow's coming down
(Christmas) I'm watching it fall
(Christmas) Lots of people around
(Christmas) Baby, please come home
(Christmas) The church bells in town
(Christmas) Are ringing in song
(Christmas) Full of happy sounds
(Ah) They're singing "Deck The Halls"
(Ah) But it's not like Christmas at all

===== Mariah Carey - Hero =====
There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way

===== Mariah Carey - Without You =====
No, I can't forget this evenin', or your face as you were leavin'
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrow when I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't give, I can't give anymore
Well, I can't forget this evenin' or your face as you were leavin'
You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows
Yes, it's shows
No, I can't live, no, I can't live
No, I, no, no, no, no, I
Can't live (No, I can't live) if living is without you (No, I can't live)
Can't live (No, I can't live, no, I can't live)
No, no, I, no, no, no, no, I

If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gon' leave with me when I do, I do

You won't wanna go nowhere
In the lap of luxury
Laying intertwined with me (La-la-la-la-da-da-da)
You won't want for nothing, boy (No)

===== Mariah Carey - One Sweet Day =====
Sorry I've never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away, so far away
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive, alive
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (Together)
One sweet day
(And I'll wait patiently to see you in Heaven)
Darling, I never showed you (No, no, no, no)
Assumed you'd always be there (Always there)
I thought you'd always be there
I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared (But I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared (Yeah, and I know)
Like so many friends we've lost along the way (Lost along the way)
And I know eventually we'll be together (Oh, no, I know)
(Although the sun will never shine the same again)
(I'll always look to a brighter day) Yeah, yeah
Lord, I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day (One sweet day)
And I know eventually we'll be together (Yes, we will)
(One sweet day) One sweet day
Sorry, I never told you

===== Mariah Carey - When You Believe =====
Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could
Oh yes
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
Somehow you will
You will when you believe
Oh (Mmm, yeah)
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say
(When you believe)
It's hard to kill (Mmm)
You can achieve (You can achieve)
They don't always happen when you ask, uh
And it's easy to give in to your fears, oh (Oh)
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small, but still, resilient voice
Says help is very near, oh
There can be miracles (Miracles)
When you believe (Oh, when you believe)
It's hard to kill (Hard to kill, oh yeah)
You can achieve (You can achieve, oh)
Somehow you will (Somehow, somehow, somehow)
Now you will
You will when you, when you believe, oh
Just believe (You will, you will)
Just believe

===== Mariah Carey - My All =====
Nah-mm-mm-mm
Nah, ooh, mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm
I am thinkin' of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then, my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you and I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Baby, can you feel me?
Imaginin' I'm lookin' in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet, you're so far, like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
Give my all for your love
Tonight

===== Mariah Carey - O Holy Night =====
O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night
O night divine, yeah
O night divine (O night divine)
Ooh, yes it was (O night divine)
Oh, it is the night of our dear Savior's birth (O night divine)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, it is (O night divine)
It was a long night, long night, long night
Oh, oh, oh, woah, woah, woah, yes it was (O night divine)

===== Mariah Carey - Heartbreaker =====
Yeah
We're gonna do it like this
Aight
Let's go
Jigga
Gimme your love (Uh), gimme your love (What?)
Gimme your love (MC), gimme your love (Uh, jigga)
Gimme your love, gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love (Hey)
Gimme your love, gimme your love (You gotta bounce to this like this)
Gimme your love, gimme your love (You almost gotta watch and listen)
Gimme your love (Uh-huh), gimme your love (Woo)
Gimme your love (X-Scape), gimme your love
Boy, your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all
Boy, if I do
The things you want me to (Uh-huh)
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby (Uh-huh)
Or leave me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Gimme your love (Uh-huh), gimme your love (Yeah)
Gimme your love, gimme your love (What?)
Gimme your love (She want), gimme your love (She said)
Gimme your love (Uh-huh), gimme your love
Gimme your love, gimme your love (Yeah, we comin' back)
It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things that you know
Persuade me to relinquish my love to you
But I cannot resist at all
Boy, if I do (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah-yes)
The things you wanna do
Would you love me, baby (Love me, oh)
Or leaving me feeling used?
(Heartbreaker, you got the best of me)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me (You got the best)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on, keep on)
(Why, why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start (I'm all over ready, uh-huh, okay, cool)
(The start that you'd go and break my heart)
You'd go and break my heart (Alright, yo)
She wanna shop with Jay, play box with Jay
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my day
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi (Uh-huh), rub up in the movies (Uh-huh)
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her mom's
She calls me "heartbreaker"
When we apart, it makes her want a piece of paper
Scribble down "I hate ya"
But she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does, and all
(Oh boy, you got the best of me)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on coming back)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me (Why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start, (Right from the start that you'd)
You'd go and break my heart (Go and break my heart)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me (Ah)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (Ooh)
I should have known right from the start (I should have known)
You'd go and break my heart (That you would go and break my heart)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (Break it down)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me (Boy, if I do)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (The things you want me to, the way I used to do)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me? (Would you love me, baby)
I should have known right from the start (Or leave me feeling used?)
You'd go and break my heart (Would you go and break my heart?)
Gimme your love, gimme your love (Damn straight)
Gimme your love, gimme your love (That's a wrap)

Heard y'all was- hold up, my phone's breakin' up
I'ma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time (No) so I'm leaving you behind (Uh-huh)

Save this recording because I'm never coming back home (Uh-huh)

You do the things you do while I'm 'sleep on Christmas Eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby

So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
'Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, ol' Kris Kringle, save me
They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you, Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa, won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night?
Oh, Santa (Oh, oh, oh)
Come on, Santa (Oh, Santa)
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas (Oh, Santa)

Oh, Santa Claus
If you get this letter, please don't make me wait
'Cause all December, I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies
The tree's all sparkly and gold
But inside, I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa, won't you come and make him mine this Christmas?
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho (Oh)

But I like the way I feel inside
In the morning when I rise
You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine

It's like tha-a-a that, a like that y'all (That y'all!) (It's like)
This is my night!
Let's go now, what, let's go now, what
Here we go now, what, here we go now, what

===== Justin Timberlake - CAN'T STOP THE FEELING! =====
I got this feelin' inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket, got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (Ooh)
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine (Just imagine, just imagine)
Nothin' I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
A feelin' good, good, creepin' up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leavin' soon
So keep dancin'
I can't stop the feelin'
So just dance, dance, dance
Ooh, it's somethin' magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushin' on (Rushin' on)
I don't need no reason, don't need control (Need control)
I fly so high, no ceilin', when I'm in my zone
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket, got that good soul in my feet
But you dance, dance, dance (No, no, no)
I can't stop the feelin' (Woo)
I can't stop the feelin' (Yeah)
So keep dancin', come on
Oh
Yeah, oh
I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
So just dance, dance, dance, come on (Oh)
But you dance, dance, dance (Dance, dance, dance)
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'
Everybody sing
(Got this feelin' in my body)
(Got this feelin' in my body) Oh, no
(Wanna see you move your body) No, no, no
(Got this feelin' in my body, come on)
Break it down
(Got this feelin' in my body) Uh
(Got this feeling in my body, come on) Ooh

===== Justin Timberlake - Mirrors =====
Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror's staring back at me  (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror's staring back at me, staring back at me
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Ooh, I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time
I'm here tryna pull you through
My mirror's staring back at me (Oh)
Yesterday is history, oh
Tomorrow's a mystery, oh
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me
Show me how to fight for now (You show me, baby)
Ohh (Oh oh, oh oh)
Ohh ohh (Oh oh, oh oh)
Uhh (Oh oh, oh oh)
You are, you are the love of my life
Now, you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are
Girl, you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you

===== Justin Timberlake - SexyBack =====

===== Justin Timberlake - Rock Your Body =====
Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me

Just let me rock you 'til the break of day
Guy time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you, girl

See, I've been watchin' you
And I like the way you move
So go ahead, girl, just do
That ass-shakin' thing you do
So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right
So you pass to the left, then you sail to the right
I don't mean no harm
Make a move, but be calm
Let's go, let's give it a whirl
See, it appears to me
You like the way I move
I'll tell you what I'm gon' do
Pull you close and share my groove
Talk to me, boy

But I can't wait to have you in my arms
Hurry up 'cause you're takin' too long
Better have you naked by the end of this song
So what did you come for?
I came to dance with you
And you know that you don't wanna hit the floor
Came to romance with you
You're searchin' for love forever more
And I'll take a chance
If love is here on the floor, girl
Hey, dance with me
Yeah

Let's make a bet
'Cause I
I better have you naked by the end of this song

===== Justin Timberlake - Cry Me a River =====
You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance and made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no
You don't have to say
What you did
I already know
I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy
The bridges were burned, now it's your turn to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)
You know that they say that some things are better left unsaid
And it wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
And all of these things people told me keep messin' with my head (Messin' with my head)
Should've picked honesty, then you may not have blown it, yeah
You don't have to say (Don't have to say)
What you did (What you did)
I already know (I already know)
I found out from him (Uh)
Now there's just no chance (No chance)
With you and me (You and me)
You told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone? (All alone)
Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone (When you call me on the phone)
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused with some other guy (Not like them, baby)
The bridges were burned, now it's your turn (It's your turn) to cry (So)
Cry me a river (Go on and just)
Cry me a river (Baby, go on and just)
Oh (Oh, well)
The damage is done, so I guess I'll be leavin' (Oh, oh, oh)
The damage is done, so I guess I'll be l-l-l-l-leavin' (Oh, oh, oh)

Oh, cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river (Cry me, cry me)

===== Justin Timberlake - Say Something =====
Mhmm, yeah, alright
Ooh
Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere
I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there
Everybody says, "Say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin', say somethin'"
Then, "Say somethin'"
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have
(Maybe I'm lookin' for somethin' I can't have)
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still, in my heart somewhere
There's melody and harmony for you and me tonight
(Ooh, woah) I hear them call my name
Sometimes, the greatest way to say somethin'
Is to say nothin' at all
Is to say nothin'

===== Justin Timberlake - My Love =====
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my—
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? (Tell me, would you?)
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying "I do")
Because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)
My love (So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Girl, my love, my love
Now if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (What would you do?)
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? (Tell me, would you?)
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure (That, baby, it's you)
And everything that you'd been waitin' for (Just say it, "I do")
Aight, it's time to get it, JT
I don't know what you're hesitatin' for, man
Ay, ay, ay
Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again (Ay)
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan (Nah)
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When they wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends, so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy (Why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire (Haha)
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try (Nah)
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what'd you mean, you can't go? Why? (Why?)
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie (Uh-uh)
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high (Man...)
Well, baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
St. Bart's, Anguilla, anywhere I chill (Nice)
Just bring with me a pair, I will (C'mon)
See, all I want you to do is be my love (Love)
My love (Love)

===== Justin Timberlake - What Goes Around.../...Comes Around =====
Hey, girl
Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end, but I guess I was wrong, uh
Don't wanna think about it (Uh)
Don't wanna talk about it (Uh)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's endin' this way
Just so confused about it (Uh)
Feelin' the blues about it (Yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Tell me, is this fair?
Is this the way it's really goin' down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breakin' my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're livin' a lie
But that's okay, baby, 'cause in time, you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Comes all the way back around (Yeah)
Now, girl
I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were movin' on now (On now)
And maybe I should do the same (Maybe I should do the same)
The funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
And now it's all just a shame and I guess I was wrong, uh
Don't wanna think about it (No)
Don't wanna talk about it (Hmm)
Can you tell me, is this fair?
Is this how we say goodbye? (Uh)
Should've known better that you were gonna make me cry
And now it's breakin' my heart to watch you run around
That's okay, baby, 'cause in time, you will find
What goes around comes around
Yeah
You should know that
You should know that (Yeah)
Is this how we say goodbye? (Oh)
(Now it's breakin' my heart)
Comes all the way back around, yeah
Yep, yep, yep
Let me paint this picture for you, baby, yep
You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him, all you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out that he's doin' to you
What you did to me, ain't that the way it goes?
When you cheated, girl, my heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without sayin' that you left me feelin' hurt
Just a classic case, a scenario
Tale as old as time, girl, you got what you deserved
And now you want somebody (Hey)
To cure the lonely nights (Hey)
You wish you had somebody (Hey)
That could come and make it right (Hey)
But girl, I ain't somebody (Hey)
With a lot of sympathy (Hey)
You'll see, see
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(Take it to 'em, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ha-ha-ha-ha
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, take it to 'em)
See, you should've listened to me, baby
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, take it to 'em)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, take it to 'em, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, girl)
Because (What goes around comes back around)
Hahahaha

Nothing exceeds like excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best

-Aurant with my rant disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
Uh! This is truffle season

Ass-tight denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young, uh!

You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her, 'cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, huh, uh
As long as I got my suit and tie
Show you a few things about love, love, love
Le-le-let me show you a few things (Show you a few things)
Oh!
No, no, no, no, yeah
Ooh, ooh, oh
Yeah, hey, hey
Still swinging the night away
Swinging the night away, oh

===== Justin Timberlake - Selfish =====
Uh
If they saw what I saw
They would fall the way I fell
But they don't know what you want
And baby, I would never tell
If they knew what I know
They would never let you go
So guess what?
I ain't ever lettin' you go
'Cause your lips were made for mine
And my heart would go flatline
If it wasn't beatin' for you all the time
So if I get jealous, I can't help it
I want every bit of you, I guess I'm selfish
It's bad for my mental, but I can't fight it, when
You're out lookin' like you do, but you can't hide it, no
Put you in a frame, ooh, baby, who could blame you?
Glad your mama madе you
Makin' me insane, you cannot be еxplained, ooh
You must be an angel
Every time the phone rings
I hope that it's you on the other side
I wanna tell you everything ('Thing)
Everything that's on my mind
And I don't want any other guys
Takin' my place, girl, I got too much pride
I know I may be wrong
But I don't wanna be right
If it wasn't beatin' for you all the time, uh
Glad your mama made you
Makin' me insane, you cannot be explained, ooh
Owner of my heart
Tattooed your mark
There for the whole world to see
You're the owner of my heart
And all my scars
Baby, you got such a hold on me, so
I want every bit of you, I guess I'm selfish (I guess I'm selfish)
Glad your mama made you (Glad your mama made you)
You must be an angel (You must be an angel)
Jealous, but I can't help it

So put your filthy hands all over me
Go on and put your filthy hands all over me
No, this ain't the clean version
Do you see me?
Can you find me?
Look closer, through the trees
Do you see it?

===== Justin Timberlake - Like I Love You =====
Just somethin' about you
Way I'm lookin' at you, whatever
Keep lookin' at me
You're scared now, right?
Don't fail me, baby
It's just Justin
You feel good, right?
Listen
I kinda noticed somethin' wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kinda weird to me since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change
If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song with me
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
See, people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing? (Thing, thing)
They say so and so was datin'
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight
Just be limber, baby
Baby, just remember
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey)
Yeah, you know I can make you happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
I won't let you down, baby
Here, baby, put on my jacket
And then
Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you, baby)
Girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl (Ooh)
Ma, whatchu wanna do? I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see? I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
In the mall, kids ask, "How'd the chain glow?"
Point to her, they say, "Wow, it's the same glow"
Point to me, I say, "Yeah, it's the same dough"
We the same type, you my a-like (Yeah)
You have me sleepin' in the same bed every night
Go ride with me, you deservin' the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play number three, joint called "Brain" (I just love your, brain)
Ma, took a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake, now how heavy is that?
Girl
Ho
Ain't nobody love you like I love you (Can't love you like I do)
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust you (Makes me trust you like I do) (Hey!)
Late at night, I talk to you (Hey)
You will know the difference when I—
Break it down
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, drums (Hey)
It's kind of special, right? Yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes, people just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now, everybody dance

===== Justin Timberlake - September =====
Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancin' in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda
My thoughts are with you
Holdin' hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now December found the love we shared in September
Remember, the true love we share today
And we say
The bell was ringin', aha
Our souls were singin'
Do you remember?
Never was a cloudy day
Break it down for me (Say do you remember)
Dancin' in September
Ba de ya
Say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancin' in September (We're dancin' in September)
Uh huh! (Bring it back now)
Uh huh!
All the way down to the summer

===== Justin Timberlake - Hair Up =====
Hair up
Hair in the air
Put your hair
Put your hair in the air
I've got a fever coming on
And now it's beating on my bones
I feel like diamonds or some gold
So DJ play it
That's my song
Go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Come on baby
Let's go crazy
We ain't never gonna stop
Put your hair in the air (hair up)
We don't care (hair up)

===== Justin Timberlake - Mirrors =====
Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror's staring back at me  (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror's staring back at me, staring back at me
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
Ooh, I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time
I'm here tryna pull you through
My mirror's staring back at me (Oh)
Yesterday is history, oh
Tomorrow's a mystery, oh
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me
Show me how to fight for now (You show me, baby)
Ohh (Oh oh, oh oh)
Ohh ohh (Oh oh, oh oh)
Uhh (Oh oh, oh oh)
You are, you are the love of my life
Now, you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are
Girl, you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you

About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm goin'
There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you, girl
And what you give me lets me know that I'll be alright
'Cause if your love was all I had
In this life
Well, that would be enough
Until the end of time
So rest your weary heart
And relax your mind

Everybody, sing, "Oh, woah, yeah"
Everybody's singin', "Oh, woah, yeah"
Now if you're ever wonderin'
About the way I'm feelin'

Just to be around you is a blessing
Sick and tired of tryna save the world

And what you give me lets me know that we'll be alright

===== Justin Timberlake - LoveStoned / I Think She Knows (Interlude) =====
Hey, uh
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it
Listen
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight
And she looks like a model
Except she got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
Ooh, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight
Hey
Those flashin' lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I have to stop and stare
She's got me love-stoned
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows
I think that she knows, uh
Yeah
She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
Well, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
Man, I swear she's bad and she knows
Those flashin' lights seem to cause a glare (Cause a glare)
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare (I had to stop and stare)
She's got me love-stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows
I think that she knows
Now, dance
Get it, girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn
Let me put my funk on the guitar
Uh, ah
Ow!
Those flashin' lights come from everywhere, uh
Those flashin' lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her, I hafve to stop and stare (Hey)
I think that she knows (Hey, yeah)
Those flashin' lights come from everywhere (Hey, yeah)
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare (Whoa, oh-oh-oh)
The way they hit her, I just stop and stare
I think I'm love-stoned
Think that she knows, oh, oh

The way they hit her, I just stop and stare, but I'm (Seem to stop and stare)
I'm love-stoned from everywhere, and she knows
I think that she knows (Oh, oh)
And now I walk around without a care (Without a care)
She's got me hooked, it just ain't fair, but I
I'm love-stoned, and I could swear that she knows
I think that she knows, oh, oh
She knows, she knows, oh, oh
Mmm-mm-hmm-mm, mm-mm-hmm (Oh, oh)

===== Justin Timberlake - Drink You Away =====
Bittersweet thing, could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake?
Feel it in my brain, tall shot of pain
Pour a little out now for the love that we've made
I feel it in the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see ya but you're gone, telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth, I dive in, but I can't
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin I'm livin' in
Say, now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me, baby, oh, yeah, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Got that poundin' on my brain, so I drowned it away
When the sun comes up tomorrow, you can find me doin' the same
'Cause I just can't forget the way we turned out this bad
And now, the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead
And then I feel it in the morning, you're still here in the morning
But I can't drink you away (No, I can't)
Say, tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Oh, tell me, baby, one time, come on, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Break it down
I can't drink you
No, I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you away, away
No, I can't drink you away
Say, so tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me, baby, oh, yeah, one time, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak, yeah?
Oh, yeah, tell me, baby, can't they make a medicine for my heartbreak, heartbreak?
Tell me, baby, can't they make a medicine for my heartbreak?
'Cause I can't drink you away

===== Jennifer Lopez - Love Don't Cost a Thing =====
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw the dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast, so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (Ooh)
When I took a chance thought you'd understand (You don't understand)
Baby, credit cards aren't romance
So you're trying to buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you (You) that I really feel (Feel)
Doing way too much (Much), never keep it real (Real)
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys? I've got to go
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't (Baby)
My love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (No)
Love don't cost a thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You think the money that you make (That you make)
Can substitute the time you take (The time you take)
To get the keys into my heart
Think you can win my heart, don't know what's in my heart (Don't cost a thing)
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true (Ooh)
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart
Even if you were broke (Even if you were broke)
My love don't cost a thing (My love don't cost a thing)
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (Think I wanna)
If I wanna floss, I got my own (If I wanna, don't)
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't (Think I wanna)
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't (If I want my own)
If I wanna floss, I got my own (If I want my own)

===== Jennifer Lopez - If You Had My Love =====
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?
Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you?
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool (Yeah, yeah)
You said that we could possibly spend eternity
(You said that we could possibly spend eternity, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams
(You want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you really want me, bae
Would you comfort me? Tell me, baby
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue, yeah (How you knew)
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? (Na, na, na, na, na)
You said you want my love and you've got to have it all
But first, there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah
I don't want you trying to get with me (Don't want you)
(Don't want you trying to get with me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain
So before I do give myself to you
(So before I do give myself to you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust (Had my love, gave you trust)
Would you comfort me? What would you do, babe? Tell me right now
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue (I need to know, be untrue)

And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue (Tell me)
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? (Don't you lie to me, call me, call me "baby")

===== Jennifer Lopez - Waiting for Tonight =====
Oh, yeah
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh, oh)
Waiting for tonight, oh (Tonight, tonight)
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh (Tonight, tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh)

===== Jennifer Lopez - All I Have =====
Love is life and life is living
It's very special
All my love…
Oh-oh-oh
Uh, baby, don't go
All my, all my, all my love
Baby, don't go, yeah
Very special
Baby, don't go, uh
All my love
Baby, don't go
I understand, just chillin'
Baby, don't go, yeah, yeah
Why you actin' like that?
It's such a shame, but I'm leaving (Uh)
Can't take the way you mistreated me (Uh)
And it's crazy, but oh, baby (Come on, yo, uh, uh, uh)
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man
Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (What you want, baby?)
I gotta leave you alone (Come on now)
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block (Don't go, baby)
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right? (Come on, baby)
All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh
The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you (Uh, uh, uh)
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town (Creepin')
I thought my tender touch could lock you down (Yeah)
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now (Come here)
Stop playing (Haha, aw), you gaming
I gotta leave you alone (What you want now?)
'Cause I'm good holding down my spot
Stop acting like that
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
Now you know you need to stop
So without me you'll be fine, right?
Here we go
People make mistakes to make up, to break up, to wake up
Cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me, you love me (Oh)
I'm like your homie, instead of beefin', come hold me
I promise I'm not a phony, don't bounce, baby, console me (Come here)
Ain't nothing you can say to me that
Can change my mind, I got to let you go now (Chill, baby)
And nothing will ever be the same, so just (Yeah)
Be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now (Baby, don't go)
And there's no more to explain to me, you know (Come on, now)
I know your game and I'm not feeling what you do (Come on, now)
So I'm bouncing and I'm out, son (Don't bounce)
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah (Don't bounce, don't bounce, baby)
All my pride is all I have (Don't bounce, baby)
You'll be needing me, but too bad (Don't bounce, baby)
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (Uh)
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have (Baby, don't go)
You'll be needing me, but too bad (You're everything to me)
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad (You mean everything to me, baby)
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own (We all make mistakes, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah (I still love you, baby)
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone? Huh (I'll always love you, baby)
I promise you
You know what I'm sayin'?

Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Yes)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Miss Lopez, uh um)
Hi, I'm Tune, the man on the moon
I live on the beach, get the sand out your shoes
And all of that changed since I met you
So we can leave that old shit in the restroom
Young Money
You got me and I could not defend it
I tried, but I had to surrender
Your style got me under the spellbound
Let me no other choice but to get down
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, ah
It's too late, tell 'em
You got it, you got it
You got it, ah
When I look into your eyes, it's over
You got me hooked with your love controller (Yeah)
I'm tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover
I'm into you (Ayy)
I'm into you, yeah (Come on, ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy, I'm into you)
I'm into you, yeah (Uh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Ayy)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (Yeah)
Listen, now I'm strong, baby, I bring the fire on
Sharpshooter, you can call me "The Zion"
I'm not the one easy to get to
But all that changed, baby, when I met you
It's too late, come on

You got me hooked with your love controller
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover (Why?)
I'm into you, yeah (Ayy)
I'm into you (Ayy, hahah!)
I'm into you, yeah
Okay, now I'm into you, like you never knew
I'm falling for you, baby, I need a parachute
Pussy so wet, I need a wetsuit
You're way too fly, I could be your jet fuel
Now tell me what you like, I like what you tell me
And if you understand me, then you can overwhelm me
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race, ha!
When I look into your eyes, it's over (When I look into your eyes, baby, yeah)
You got me hooked with your love controller (I know)
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover (Come on)

'Cause I'm into you, I'm into you (Ayy)

===== Jennifer Lopez - Ain't It Funny =====
It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind (In my mind)
I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance (Ooh)
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be (Never be)
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me (Ooh)
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about (You're about)
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt (Ooh)
You've touched my heart, and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid
I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be (Ooh)
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be
And you can't move on even though you try?
Oh, I wish this could be real (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life  (Oh, yeah)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No, no)
In the story of your heart? (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even if you try)
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (Wrong or right)
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even though you try)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life?
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right?
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny

===== Jennifer Lopez - Feel The Light =====
Here I go, here I go
Feel better now, feel better now
It's better now, feel better now
Do you remember when we fell under
Did you expect me to reason with thunder
I still remember when time was frozen
What seemed forever was just a moment
Hurry up, hurry up
There's no more waiting
We're still worth saving
Feel the light
Shining in the dark of night
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back
Shining like the stars tonight
I still remember when things were broken
But put together the cracks we'll close in
You and I can have it all tonight
So let's bring it back to life
Now we have another chance to fly
Another chance to make it right
Here we go, here we go

===== Jennifer Lopez - Play =====
I could wait all night and day
To go to a party, sit down and wait
Give my request to the DJ
'Cause my song, he's gotta play (Just play my song)
And when I hear that beat, I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playing my song
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play, come on, DJ, play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
DJ, just play that song
'Cause I wanna be dancing (DJ) all night long
Play my, play my, play my, play my
Play my favorite song (Uh)
I don't care if everybody's gone
Turn it up 'cause it turns me on
Keep dancing all night long
Feels so right that it can't be wrong (Can't be wrong)
I get chills up and down my spine
Whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops, better press rewind (Play that shit again)
Let me hear it one more time
'Cause I wanna be dancing all night long (You know this song)
Just turn it up, and turn it on (One more time)
'Cause I wanna be dancing all night long
I just wanna dance, is that a crime?
Alright then
Ooh, uh
Oh (Alright)
(Yeah, that's the hotness right here)
(Play, play, play, play)
Play, come on play that song (Now, Mr. DJ)
Play it all night long (I've asked you three times already)
Just turn it up and turn it on (Play my motherfuckin' song)
Play, come on, DJ, play that song (Haha)
(Turn it up, turn it up)
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn the track)
Play, come on play that song (Oh)
Play, come on play that song (Turn it up)
Play it all night long (Play it all night long)
Just turn it up, and turn it on
Play, come on, DJ, play that song (Uh-huh)

So good, knowing I could just keep it real, t-shirt and jeans
See you making me feel so fly
Oh, oh (Oh)

===== Jennifer Lopez - On My Way (Marry Me) =====
Always knew you even when I didn't
Know you, don't make sense, but it do
I was on my way to you
Every teardrop fell so heavy
Hurt like hell but Heaven sent me through
I was on my way to you
Every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointing me straight, just taking me home
I was never lost, I was just passing through
Hope was hopeless, faith was running
Didn't notice you were coming through
You were on your way too
And you don't believe in meant-to-be
But somehow you were meant for me, it's true
Yeah, you were on your way too
I was on my way to you, oh
I'm on my way
On my way to you
On my way
On my way to you, oh
On my way (On my way)
And every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Hoo, hoo, hoo
On my, darling, I'm on my way

Press my buttons, yeah, blow the stage (Grenade)
Oh my, tonight we go orangutan (Bananas)
No hold, there is no stopping us tonight

Feeling like a billion, billion
No hold, there ain't no stopping us tonight
Hey, put your palms on the ceiling
Nobody move, nobody get shot
Next rounds on me
I love a hot mami when she around on me
So I never get enough of yelling, ven aqui
Officer on duty, J.Lo what they call her
Take me to jail, 'cause I wanna be your robber
Put me in a cell if you really need to holler
Put me in a cell, feet down, Flo Rida, hey
To the sky, put your hands on rock
Plus nobody telling please that the club is mi casa
Shorty want a freak, I'm the one you call papa
Got to make them sing high notes like opera
When the ego, I got four leo
Even the DJ, wanna rep Puerto Rico
Got it on replay, like you just broke a needle
Whatever that he say, better listen up people
Tonight, feels like
Tonight, feels like, the best night of my life
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, hey

===== Miley Cyrus - Malibu =====
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am
Next to you
The sky is more blue
In Malibu
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping I just stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish
To swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you
If three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
The sky is so blue
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true

===== Miley Cyrus - Flowers =====
We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn
Mm, I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna lie
Started to cry, but then remembered I
I can buy myself flowers
Write my name in the sand
Talk to myself for hours
Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Paint my nails cherry-red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said
Ooh, I didn't wanna leave you, baby, I didn't wanna fight
Talk to myself for hours, yeah
I can take myself dancing, yeah
I can hold my own hand
Can love me better, I (Ooh, I)
I didn't wanna leave you, I didn't wanna fight
I can buy myself flowers (Uh-huh)
Talk to myself for hours (Yeah)
Say things you don't understand (You never will)
Yeah, I can love me better than
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby (Uh)
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby (Than you can)
Can love me better, I

===== Miley Cyrus - Party In The U.S.A. =====
I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Woah)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?"
"She gotta be from out of town"
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
Feel like hopping on a flight (On a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (Town tonight)
Something stops me every time (Every time)
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright (Hey, hey)
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah" (N-n-n-noddin' my head)
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah" (Ooh, yeah)
I know I'm gonna be okay (Gonna be okay)
Yeah (Na-na, na-na), it's a party in the U.S.A. 
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away (Flying away)
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah" (Noddin' my head like, "Yeah")
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah" (Movin' my hips like, "Yeah")
I know I'm gonna be okay (I'm gonna be okay)
Yeah (Yeah), it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah (Ha-ha-ha-ha), it's a party in the U.S.A. 

===== Miley Cyrus - Angels Like You =====
Flowers in hand, waiting for me
Every word in poetry
Won't call me by name, only "baby"
The more that you give, the less that I need
Everyone says I look happy
When it feels right
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight, mother says you don't look happy
Close your eyes
La, la, la, la
Oh, ah, ah
Ah, oh
It's not your fault I ruin everything (Everything)
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me, oh
Angels like you can't fly down here with me

If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "hell no"? (Hell no, hell no)
'Cause we gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
So la-da-di-da-di, we like to party

Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothin' from nobody, yeah, yeah
To my homegirls here with the big butt

===== Miley Cyrus - Wrecking Ball =====
We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win

===== Miley Cyrus - Prisoner =====
Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Strung out on a feeling, my hands are tied
Your face on my ceiling, I fantasize
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (I can't control it)
I try to replace it with city lights
I'll never escape it, I need the high
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (Oh)
You keep making it harder to stay
But I still can't run away
I gotta know why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
I tasted Heaven, now I can't live without it
I can't forget you and your love is the loudest
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it (Can't control it)
You keep making it harder to stay (Oh, ah)
I gotta know, why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind (Off my mind)
Can't get you off my mind
Why can't you just let me go?
Million times
I wanna know why can't you, why can't you

===== Miley Cyrus - The Climb =====
I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
"You'll never reach it"
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost with no direction
My faith is shaken
But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb
The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that
I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going
And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on 'cause
Yeah
Sometimes you're gonna have to lose
Keep on moving
Keep climbing
Keep the faith, baby
It's all about, it's all about the climb
Keep your faith, keep your faith
Whoa-ooh-oh

===== Miley Cyrus - Midnight Sky =====
La, la, la-la, la
Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own (Uh)
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes (Your ropes)
Forever and ever, no more (No more)
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds (Oh, oh)
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true (Yeah)
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you (Loved by you)
She got her hair pulled back 'cause the sweat's drippin' off of her face (Her face)
Said, "It ain't so bad if I wanna make a couple mistakes"
You should know right now that I never stay put in one place
Oh
I don't hide blurry eyes like you
Like you
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, you know
See his hands 'round my waist, thought you'd never be replaced, baby
I don't need to be loved by you (Yeah)
La, la
You know it's true, you know it's true
Loved by you

===== Miley Cyrus - When I Look At You =====
Everybody needs inspiration
Everybody needs a song
A beautiful melody
When the night's so long
'Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy
Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves are flooding the shore
And I can't find my way home anymore
When I look at you, I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone
You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that
Cover me, all I need
Every breath that I breathe
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh (I look at you)
And you appear just like a dream to me

===== Miley Cyrus - Adore You =====
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Hey
Oh, oh, mm
Baby, baby, yeah
Are you listenin'?
Wonderin' where you've been
All my life
I just started livin'
Ooh, oh, baby
Are you listenin'? Oh-oh
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
Baby, can you hear me
When I'm cryin' out for you?
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me, uh
I feel like I'm standin' with an army
Of men armed with weapons
Hey, oh
I love lyin' next to you
I could do this for eternity
You and me
We're meant to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what He was doin'
When He led me to you
Know I love you more (I love you more)

===== Miley Cyrus - Slide Away =====
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go
I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
Once upon a time, it was made for us (For us)
Move on, we're not seventeen
I'm not who I used to be
You say that everything changed
You're right, we're grown now

===== Miley Cyrus - Mother's Daughter =====
Hallelujah, I'm a freak, I'm a freak, hallelujah
Every day of the week, I'ma do ya like I want to
I'm a Nile crocodile, a piranha
Oh my God, she got the power
Oh, look at her, she got the power
So, so, so
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came up to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
So, back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Hallelujah, I'm a witch, I'm a witch, hallelujah
Swish swish, I'm a three-point shooter, I blow through ya
Like a hot wind out in the bayou, yah
Well, look at her, she got the power
My mama always told me that I'd make it
That I'd make it, so I made it
I put my back into it, my heart in it
So I did it, yeah, I did it
Oh my God, oh my God
Swish swish, motherfucka (Ow)

===== Miley Cyrus - Heart Of Glass (Live from the iHeart Festival) =====
Once had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out I had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind
Once had a love and it was divine
I soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do
Much o' mistrust, love's gone bеhind
Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm thе one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising, yeah
Riding high on love's true bluish light
Once I had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find

===== Miley Cyrus - Used To Be Young =====
The truth is bulletproof, there's no foolin' you
I don't dress the same
Me and who you say I was yesterday
Have gone our separate ways
Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
'Cause that's for chasin' cars
Turns out open bars lead to broken hearts
And goin' way too far
I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young
You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine, I've had a good run
That's 'causе I used to be young
Take onе, pour it out, it's not worth cryin' 'bout
The things you can't erase
Like tattoos and regrets, words I never meant
And ones that got away
And took another road
Turns out crowded rooms empty out as soon
There's somewhere else to go, oh-oh
That's 'cause I used to be young
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh
Yeah
Woah-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Messed up, but, God, was it fun
I know I used to be wild
Those wasted nights are not wasted
I remember every one

===== Miley Cyrus - Plastic Hearts =====
Ah!
Hello
The sunny place for shady people
A crowded room where nobody goes
You can be whoever you wanna be here
And, oh
I've been livin' at the Chateau
Shouldn't drive, but I should really go home
I don't even know 'em, but they won't leave here
Frightened by my own reflection
Desperate for a new connection
Pull you in, but don't you get too close
Love you now, but not tomorrow
Wrong to steal, but not to borrow
I've been California dreamin'
Plastic hearts are bleedin'
Keep me up all night (Keep me up)
Keep me up all night (All night)
Lost in black hole conversation
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night
I just wanna feel (Feel)
I just wanna feel somethin' (Feel somethin' now)
But I keep feeling nothin' all night long
All night long
Hello (Hello)
I'll tell you all the people I know (I know)
Sell you somethin' that you already own (You own)
I can be whoever you want me to be
Love me now, but not tomorrow
Fill me up, but leave me hollow
Pull me in, but don't you get too close (Oh)
Lost in black hole conversations
But I keep feelin' nothin' all night long
I've been California dreamin' (Dreamin')
Plastic hearts are bleedin' (Are bleedin')
Keep me up all night (Yeah)
Keep me up all night (Keep me up, oh yeah)

===== Miley Cyrus - Jaded =====
I don't wanna call and talk too long
I know it was wrong, but never said I was sorry
Now I've had time to think it over
We're much older and the bone's too big to bury
Oh, isn't it a shame that it ended like that?
Said goodbye forever, but you never unpacked
We went to Hell, but we never came back
I'm sorry that you're jaded
I could've taken you places
You're lonely now and I hate it
You're not even willin' to look at your part
You just jump in the car and head down to thе bar 'til you're blurry
Don't know when to stop, so you take it too far
I don't know whеre you are and I'm left in the dark 'til I'm worried
Ooh, and it hurts me
And it's a fuckin' shame that it ended like that
You broke your own heart, but you'd never say that
I'm sorry that you're jaded (Jaded)
I could've taken you places (Places)
I won't lie, it won't be easy
When somebody new is on your body
I'll change my number but keep your T-shirt
I don't mind it's torn up and faded

===== Miley Cyrus - See You Again =====
I got my sights set on you, and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again
I've got a way of knowin' when something is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
(I can't wait) Now I can't wait to see you again
The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa
I, I can't wait to see you again
I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm reading the signs
(That you can't wait) That you can't wait to see me again
(To see you again)

===== Miley Cyrus - 7 Things =====
I probably shouldn't say this, but at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standin' in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear
The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
It's awkward and silent, as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear (Clear, clear)
Oh, I'm not comin' back
You're taking seven steps here
And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the seven that I like
The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined, everything's alright
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
(Sha, sha)
You do, oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
(La, la, la, la)

===== Miley Cyrus - River =====
I got a new dress just to meet you downtown
Can you walk me through the park just to show it off?
I can pull my hair back in that tight way that you like
If you wrap me in your arms and never stop
Heart beats so loud that it's drownin’ me out
Livin' in an April shower
You're pourin’ down, baby, drown me out (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You're just like a river (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You go on forever
You're just like a river
Blowing bubbles in the bath, I can't stop from thinking lately
You could be the one, have the honor of my babies
Hope they have your eyes and that crooked smile
Was a desеrt 'fore I met you, I was in a drought
Heart bеats so loud that it's drownin' me out
Livin’ in an April shower
You’re pourin' down, baby, drown me out (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You’re just like a river (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You're never runnin’ dry (Oh)
I feel you everywhere
Your face is all in my hair (Hair)
Covered up in your sweat
It turns me on that you care, baby
Your love, it flows just like a river
You're just like a river (That's what you are)
You're just like a river (Heart beats so loud that it's drownin' me out)
You're just like a river (Livin' in an April shower)
You go on forever (You're pourin' down, baby, drown me out)

===== Beyoncé - Crazy in love =====
I look and stare so deep in your eyes (I-)
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name, two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling, and my pride is the one to blame (yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (hey)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-no-no
When I talk to my friends so quietly
("Who he think he is?") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
(Oh, crazy, your love) got me looking so crazy right now (your love)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (oh, your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (hey)
Got me looking so crazy in love (geah!)
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (woo!)
Got me looking so crazy in love (I'm warmed up now, let's go)
Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco
Young B and the R-O-C, uh-oh (oh)
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (oh, no)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony (oh, no)
Soprano, the ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, if anything, I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
You crazy? Bring ya whole set
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, "Hey, is he insane?" (Oh, no)
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova?
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young
Ever since I made the change over to platinum
The game's been a wrap, one
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby, you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung, and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me
You got me, you got me so crazy, baby (hey!)

===== Beyoncé - Halo =====
Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule, I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't ever gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo, ooh
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out
Halo, ooh
Ooh

To the left, to the left
Mm
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought it, nigga, please don't touch (Don't touch)
And keep talkin' that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And, it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab
Standin' in the front yard
Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was puttin' you out for?
Because you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves
You must not know 'bout me (Me)
I will have another you by tomorrow
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)
So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable)
How about I'll be nothing (Nothing)
Nothing at all to you (Nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear)

'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was so easy
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You must not know 'bout me (Baby, yeah)
You must not know 'bout me (Yeah)
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags, we're finished
(You must not know 'bout me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
(You must not know 'bout me, me)

===== Beyoncé - Drunk in Love =====
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you (Ah)
We woke up in the kitchen, sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?", oh, baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin', if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right, Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out, like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway, then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood, grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this, swerve, surfin' all in this good-good (Ha-ha-ha)
Love, love (I'm nice right now, hold up)
That D'USSÉ is the shit, if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house, time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car, talkin' 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third, I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side, ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight
Catch a charge, I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae," said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae"
I'm nice
For y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight
We sex again in the mornin'
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing that's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin' watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you right now
Daddy, I want you

===== Beyoncé - If I Were a Boy =====
If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong
But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low

So sad, uh, you're hurt, boo-hoo
Oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass, and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, baby, good lookin' out
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now
I know you want me back, it's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away, Lord knows that it would take
Another place, another time, another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that (Ah)
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Ooh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
Ooh, I will never be the best thing you never had
What goes around comes back around (Oh)
I bet it sucks to be you right now (Ooh)
I bet it sucks to be you right now
Ooh

Turn the lights on
Every night, I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance
To see you when I close my eyes
I'm goin' out of my head
Lost in a fairy tale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you (Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true (Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby, long as you're here, I'll be floatin' on air, 'cause you're mine
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up, you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you

===== Madonna - Like a Prayer =====
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
Heaven, help me
Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
Let the choir sing
I wanna take you there
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me (Mmmm...)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, oh-oh-oh yeah)
It's like a dream to me (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (Oh, yeah)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, oh)
Like a prayer
It's like a prayer, your voice can take me there
It's like a prayer

===== Madonna - Hung Up =====
Time goes by so slowly
Every little thing that you say or do
I'm hung up, I'm hung up on you
Waiting for your call, baby, night and day
I'm fed up, I'm tired of waiting on you
Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun
I'm caught up, I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone
The lights are on, but there's no one home
Tick tick tock, it's a quarter to two
And I'm done, I'm hanging up on you
I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me, 'cause I'll find my way
You'll wake up one day, but it'll be too late
Every little thing, every little thing
Waiting for your call, waiting for your call
I'm fed up, I'm tired waiting on you
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly
So slowly, so slowly, so slowly, so slowly, so

===== Madonna - La Isla Bonita =====
¿Cómo puede ser verdad?
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, "Te amo"
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Él dijo que te ama
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
La Isla Bonita
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Spanish lullaby

===== Madonna - 4 Minutes =====

Ah, yeah, ha-ha
Breakdown, c'mon
Hey, uh, c'mon, Madonna
C'mon, boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll, uh, uh
Ah, well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll, uh, mm
I want somebody to speed it up for me, then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that, you just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go?
(Fikki-fikki, fikki-fikki, come on)
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want (Fikki-fikki, ow)
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'm-a give you what you want
Time is waiting
We only got four minutes to save the world
No hesitating
Grab a boy, then grab a girl
We only got four minutes, heh, a-four minutes
So keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri-hey-madonna, uh
You gotta get in line, hop
(Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock)
That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Sometimes I think what I need is a "you" intervention, yeah
Ah, and you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move, oh, hey
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah
But if I die tonight, at least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?
(Fikki-fikki, ow)
If you thought it, it better be what you want (Come on)
If you feel it, it must be real, just
The time is waiting
Breakdown
Yeah
Yeah, uh
I only got four minutes, to save the world

===== Madonna - Like a Virgin =====
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you
I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue
But you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel
Shiny and new, hoo
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
When your heart beats next to mine
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fadin' fast
Been savin' it all for you
'Cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out
What was scared and cold

With your heartbeat next to mine
Woah
Woah (Ah)
I'll be yours 'til the end of time
'Cause you made me feel

Ooh, like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me
And your heart beats
And you love me
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Ooh, baby
Yeah, can't you hear my heart beat
For the very first time?

===== Madonna - Frozen =====
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen when your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken when your heart's not open
Mmm-mmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmm-mmm, we'd never be apart
Mmm-mmm, give yourself to me
Mmm-mmm, you hold the key
Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you, my heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen, when your heart's not open
If I could melt your heart

===== Madonna - Crazy for You =====
Swaying room, as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two, their bodies become one
I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare?
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
Crazy for you
Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all
Slowly now, we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see
Because I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
I'm crazy, crazy for you
It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you
Yeah, I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you, baby

===== Madonna - Papa Don't Preach =====
Papa, I know you're going to be upset
'Cause I was always your little girl
But you should know by now
I'm not a baby
You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong
I may be young at heart
But I know what I'm saying
The one you warned me all about
The one you said I could do without
We're in an awful mess
And I don't mean maybe, please
Papa, don't preach, I'm in trouble, deep
Papa, don't preach, I've been losing sleep
But I made up my mind, I'm
Keeping my baby, ooh
I'm gonna keep my baby, mm
He says that he's going to marry me
And we can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice
But my friends keep telling me to give it up
Saying I'm too young, I ought to live it up
What I need right now
Is some good advice, please
I'm gonna keep my baby, ooh, ooh
Daddy, daddy if you could only see
Just how good he's been treating me
You'd give us your blessing right now
'Cause we are in love
We are in love (In love), so, please (So)
Papa, don't preach (Oh, I'm gonna keep my baby)
Papa, don't preach (Ooh)
Papa, don't preach (Don't you stop loving me, daddy)
Papa, don't preach (I know I'm keeping my baby)

Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove
Your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?
Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around, you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight
Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight, I want to dance with someone else
Gonna get to know you in a special way
This doesn't happen to me every day
Don't try to hide it, love wears no disguise
I see the fire burning in your eyes
Yeah
Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time
Now I know you're mine
You've got to
At night I lock the doors, where no one else can see
Tonight I want to dance with someone else
Boy, what will it be? (You've got to)

===== Madonna - Music =====
Hey, Mr. DJ, put a record on

Do you like to boogie-woogie?
Do you like my acid rock?
And when the music starts, I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy
Music, music, music, music
Music, music, music, music, music
Music makes the people come together
Music makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel
Don't think of yesterday and I don't look at the clock

Touches everything I'm in, got to have it every day

===== Madonna - Sorry =====
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before and I
Can take care of myself
Please don't say "Forgive me"
I've seen it all before and I
Can't take it anymore
You're not half the man you think you are
Save your words because you've gone too far
I've listened to your lies and all your stories
(Listened to your stories)
You're not half the man you'd like to be
Don't explain yourself 'cause talk is cheap
There's more important things than hearing you speak
You stayed because I made it so convenient (I made it so convenient)
Don't explain yourself, you'll never see
Gomenasai
Mujhe maaf kardo
(Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry)
Przepraszam
Sli'kha
Forgive me

===== Madonna - Medellín =====
One, two, one, two
One, two, cha-cha-cha
One, two, two, one
Two, one, cha, cha-cha-cha
I took a pill and had a dream (Yo también)
I went back to my 17th year
Allowed myself to be naive (Dime)
To be someone I've never been (Me encanta)
I took a sip and had a dream
And I woke up in Medellín (¿Te gusta?)
The sun was caressing my skin (Dime)
Another me could now begin (Woo)
Tranquila, baby, yo te apoyo
No hay que hablarnos mucho para entrar en rollo
Si quieres ser mi reina pues yo te corono
Y pa' que te sientes aquí tengo un trono
Te gusta cabalgar, eso está claro
Si sientes que voy rápido le bajo
Discúlpame, yo sé que eres Madonna
Pero te voy a demostrar cómo este perro te enamora
Ven conmigo, let's take a trip
Si te llevo pa' un lugar lejano
Ven conmigo, I'll be so good for you
Te enamoro, te enamoro, mami (Ay-ay-ay)
Dame de eso que tú estás tomando
(Ay-ay-ay)
Sipping my pain just like champagne
Found myself dancing in the rain with you
I felt so naked and alive (Show me)
For once I didn't have to hide myself (Dice)
Oye mamacita, ¿qué te pasa? (Dime)
Mira que ya estamos en mi casa (Yeah)
Si siente' que hay un viaje ahí en tu mente (Woo)
Será por el exceso de Aguardiente (Dile)
Pero, mami, tranquila, tú solo vacila
Que estamos en Colombia, aquí hay rumba en cada esquina
Y si tú quieres nos vamos por Detroit (Tú sabe')
Si sé de dónde vienes pues sé pa' donde voy
Ven conmigo, I'll be so good for you (Okay)
Si te enamoro (Si me enamoras)
En menos de un año, no, no (Hahaha)
No' vamo', no' vamo', no vamo' pa' Medallo (Ay, qué rico)
Es lo que amo, no, no
Pue' mami, pue' mami, pue' mami, nos casamos
(Cha-cha-cha)
One, two, slow down, papi (Woo)
One, two, ay-ay-ay
We built a cartel just for love
Venus was hovering above us (Oh, yeah)
I took a trip, it set me free (Mi reina)
Forgave myself for being me (Ay-ay-ay)
En menos de un año, no, no
One, two, slow down, papi
One, one, two, two
Cha, cha-cha-cha

===== Madonna - Live to Tell =====
I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me
I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?
If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

===== Madonna - Take a Bow =====
Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)
Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
(No one around)
Watchin' you, watchin' me, one lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say goodbye
Say goodbye (Bye-bye)
Say goodbye
Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breakin' my heart
(Breakin' my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
(Just make 'em smile the whole world loves a clown)
Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
(Role that you played)
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
All the world is a stage (World is a stage)
And everyone has their part (Has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story’d go?
How was I to know you'd break (You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart?
I've always been in love with you
(I've always been in love with you)
Guess you've always known

===== Madonna - Ray of Light =====
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light, then gone, for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years
She's got herself a universe
Quicker than a ray of light, she's flying
Quicker than a ray of light, I'm flying

===== Celine Dion - My Heart Will Go On (Love Theme from ”Titanic”) =====
Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go 'til we're gone
Love was when I loved you
One true time I'd hold to
In my life, we'll always go on
(Why does the heart go on?)
You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart
Mm, mm-mm

===== Celine Dion - Because You Loved Me (Theme From ”Up Close & Personal”) =====
For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I'll be forever thankful, baby
You're the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You're the one who saw me through, through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach
You gave me faith 'cause you believed
I'm everything I am
Because you loved me
Ooh, baby
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand, I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I'm grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I don't know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you
You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength)
Because you loved me (Loved me), oh
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark, shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration
Through the lies, you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (Oh, when I couldn't speak)
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach (Oh)
Because you loved me (Hey)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak (My voice)
You gave me faith 'cause you believed (Believed)
Oh

===== Celine Dion - It's All Coming Back to Me Now =====
There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever (Forever)
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby, baby
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse, and so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever (Forever)
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
There were things we'd never do again
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, baby, baby
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
We see just what we want to see
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this
And when I touch you like that
And if you do it like this
And if we

===== Celine Dion - The Power of Love =====
The whispers in the morning
Of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling by like thunder now
As I look in your eyes
I hold on to your body
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake
'Cause I'm your lady
And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can
Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you
Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened
But I'm ready to learn
Of the power of love
The sound of your heart beating
Made it clear suddenly
The feeling that I can't go on
Is light years away
I'm gonna do all that I can
The power of love
The power of love (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
As I look into your eyes
The power of love (The power of love)

===== Celine Dion - I'm Alive =====
Mmm-mmm
I get wings to fly
Oh, oh
I'm alive
Yeah
When you call on me
When I hear you breathe
I feel that I'm alive
When you look at me
I can touch the sky
I know that I'm alive
Oh
Oh, I
When you bless the day
I just drift away
All my worries die
I'm glad that I'm alive
You've set my heart on fire
Filled me with love
Made me a woman on clouds above
(Yeah)
I couldn't get much higher
My spirit takes flight (My spirit takes flight)
'Cause I am alive (I am alive), oh
(When you call on me) When you call on me
(When I hear you breathe) When I hear you breathe
I am alive
(When you reach for me) When you reach for me
(Raising spirits high) God knows that
That I'll be the one
Standing by through good and through trying times
And it's only begun
I can't wait for the rest of my life
(I get wings to fly, I) I feel that...
Oh (When you bless the day)
When you bless, you bless the day
(I just drift away) I just drift away
I know that I'm alive, yeah
God knows that I'm alive

===== Celine Dion - All By Myself =====
When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home
All by myself
Don't wanna be
Anymore
Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure
Don't wanna live
Oh
By myself, by myself
By myself
I never, never, never
Needed anyone

===== Celine Dion - That's the Way It Is =====
Mm, mm
Yeah
I can read your mind
And I know your story
I see what you're going through, yeah
It's an uphill climb
And I'm feeling sorry
But I know it will come to you, yeah
Don't surrender
'Cause you can win
In this thing called love
When you want it the most
There's no easy way out
When you're ready to go
And your heart's left in doubt
Don't give up on your faith
Love comes to those who believe it
And that's the way it is
When you question me
For a simple answer
I don't know what to say, no
But it's plain to see
If you stick together
You're gonna find a way, yeah
So don't surrender
Don't give up on your faith (Don't give up on your faith)
That's the way it is
When life is empty
With no tomorrow
And loneliness starts to call (Loneliness starts to call)
Baby, don't worry
Forget your sorrow
'Cause love's gonna conquer it all
All
And that's the way it is (Oh)
(There's no easy way out)
And your heart's left in doubt (Uh-huh)
(That's the way it is)
That's the way it is, babe

===== Celine Dion - Beauty and the Beast =====
Ooh, ooh
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small, to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Whoa, whoa-oh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh
Ever just the same (Yeah)
Ever just as sure
As the sun will rise  (Oh, oh, oh)
Tale as old as time (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun (Certain as the sun)
Rising in the east
Song as old as rhyme
Oh
Oh, whoa-oh
Ooh

===== Celine Dion - Ashes =====
What's left to say?
These prayers ain't working anymore
Every word shot down in flames
What's left to do with these broken pieces on the floor?
I'm losing my voice calling on you
'Cause I've been shaking
I've been bending backwards 'til I'm broke
Watching all these dreams go up in smoke
Let beauty come out of ashes
And when I pray to God, all I ask is (All I ask is)
Can beauty come out of ashes?
Can you use these tears to put out the fires in my soul?
'Cause I need you here, woah

===== Celine Dion - The Prayer =====
I pray you'll be our eyes, and watch us where we go
And help us to be wise in times when we don't know
Let this be our prayer, when we lose our way
Lead us to a place, guide us with your grace
To a place where we'll be safe
La luce che tu hai
I pray we'll find your light
Nel cuore resterà
And hold it in our hearts
A ricordarci che
When stars go out each night
L'eterna stella sei
Nella mia preghiera
Let this be our prayer
Quanta fede c'è
When shadows fill our day
Give us faith so we'll be safe
Sogniamo un mondo senza più violenza
Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza
Ognuno dia la mano al suo vicino
Simbolo di pace, di fraternità
La forza che ci dà
We ask that life be kind
È il desiderio che
And watch us from above
Ognuno trovi amor
We hope each soul will find
Intorno e dentro sé
Another soul to love
Let this be our prayer, let this be our prayer
Just like every child, just like every child
Need to find a place
Guide us with your grace
È la fede che
Hai acceso in noi
Sento che ci salvera

===== Celine Dion - Immortality =====
So this is who I am
And this is all I know
And I must choose to live
For all that I can give
The spark that makes the power grow
And I will stand for my dream if I can
Symbol of my faith in who I am
But you are my only
And I must follow on the road that lies ahead
And I won't let my heart control my head
We don't say goodbye
And I know what I've got to be
Immortality
I make my journey through eternity
I keep the memory of you and me inside
Fulfill your destiny
Is there within' the child
My storm will never end
My fate is on the wind
The king of hearts
The joker's wild
I'll make them all remember me
'Cause I have found a dream that must come true
Every ounce of me must see it through
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play
Hand over my heart I'll find my way
I will make them give to me
Immortality, oh, baby
There is a vision and a fire in me
With all my love for you
And what else we may do

===== Celine Dion - Think Twice =====
Don't think I can't feel that there's something wrong
You've been the sweetest part of my life for so long
I look in your eyes, there's a distant light
And you and I know there'll be a storm tonight
This is getting serious
Are you thinking 'bout you or us
Don't say what you're about to say
Look back before you leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice
Baby think twice
Baby think twice for the sake of our love, for the memory
For the fire and the faith that was you and me
Babe I know it ain't easy when your soul cries out for higher ground
'Cos when you're halfway up, you're always halfway down
But baby this is serious (This is serious)
Baby this is serious (This is serious)
Baby
Don't say what you're about to say (No no no no)
Look back before you leave my life (Don't leave my life)
Don't do what you're about to do
My everything depends on you (I depend on you)
Whatever it takes, I'll sacrifice
Before you roll those dice (Don't do it baby, oh don't do it baby)

===== Celine Dion - A New Day Has Come =====
A new day, ah-ah
I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on and don't shed a tear
Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you
Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe I've been touched
By an angel with love
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
A new day has come
La, da, da, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Where it was dark, now there's light
Where there was pain, now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy
A new day has
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh (Ooh-ooh)
I see a light in your eyes
All in the eyes of a boy (A new day)
By an angel, with love (A new day)
By an angel with love (A new day)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

===== Celine Dion - I Drove All Night =====
Oh, whoa, da-da-da
Ah-ey
I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming while I drove
The long straight road ahead, uh-huh, yeah
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright? (Is that alright?)
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
What in this world keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go, I hear the beating of our one heart
I think about you when the night is cold and dark, uh-huh, yeah
No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases this feeling between me and you, oh
I taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
Is that alright (Is that alright?)
Is that alright?
(I drove all night) I drove all night
(To get to you) To get to you
(Is that alright?) Is that alright?

===== Celine Dion - To Love You More =====
Take me back, into the arms I love
Need me, like you did before
Touch me once again
And remember when
There was no one that you wanted more
Don't go, you know you'll break my heart
She won't, love you like I will
I'm the one who'll stay
When she walks away
And you know I'll be standing here still
I'll be waiting for you
Here inside my heart
I'm the one who wants to love you more
You will see I can give you
Everything you need
Let me be the one to love you more
See me, as if you never knew
Hold me, so you can't let go
Just believe in me
I will make you see
All the things that your heart needs to know
Some way, all the love that we had can be saved
Whatever it takes, we'll find a way
Believe me
Can't you see I can give you
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

===== Celine Dion - O Holy Night =====
O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born
O night, O night divine!
Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains He shall break, for the slave is our brother
And in His name, all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord!
Their name forever praise we
Noel, Noel
O night, O night divine
O night, O holy night

===== Celine Dion - I Love You =====
I must be crazy now
Maybe I dream too much
But when I think of you
I long to feel your touch
To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time
So today, I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when I finally get to it
Just like a thousand times before
Then without a word he handed me this letter
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said
Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah
And maybe I, I need a little care
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you
Oh you need somebody just to hold you
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there
These three words
Oh, I love you
Please say you love me too
Please please
Say you love me too
My baby
Together, together, forever
I love you
I will be your light
Shining bright
Shining through your eyes

===== Celine Dion - I Surrender =====
Oh, mm
There's so much life I've left to live
And this fire is burning still
When I watch you look at me
I think I could find the will
To stand for every dream
And forsake this solid ground
And give up this fear within
Of what would happen if they ever knew
I'm in love with you
'Cause I'd surrender everything
To feel the chance to live again
I reach to you
I know you can feel it too
We'd make it through
A thousand dreams I still believe
I'd make you give them all to me
I'd hold you in my arms and never let go
I surrender
I know I can't survive
Another night away from you
You're the reason I go on
And now I need to live the truth
Right now, there's no better time
From this fear, I will break free
And I'll live again with love
And no, they can't take that away from me
And they will see, yeah
I'd surrender everything
Every night's getting longer
And this fire is getting stronger, baby
I'll swallow my pride (Swallow my pride)
And I'll be alive (I'll be alive)
Can't you hear my call?
I surrender all
We'll make it through
I'll make you give them all to me
I'll hold you in my arms and never let go
Right here, right now
I give my life to live again
I'll break free, take me
My everything, I surrender all to you
Right now (Right now)
I give my life to live again (I give my life)
I'll break free, take me (Take me)
My everything (My everything), I surrender all to you (Yeah)
I give my life to live again (I'll give my life to you, baby)
I'll break free (I'll break free)

===== Whitney Houston - I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me) =====
Ah
Yeah, woo
Hey, yeah, ah
Ooh, yeah, uh-huh
Yeah
I wanna dance
Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
The loneliness calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
I've been in love and lost to my senses
Spinnin' through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feelin' down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
I wanna feel the heat
Somebody who, somebody who
Somebody who loves me, yeah
To hold me in his arms, oh
Ooh, ooh (Dance)
Come on, baby (Dance)
Woo, yeah (Dance)
Now get with this, woah (Dance)
Don't you wanna dance (Dance) with me, baby?
Don't you wanna dance (Dance) with me, boy?
Hey, don't you wanna dance (Dance) with me, baby?
Don't you wanna dance? Say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance? (Dance)
Uh-huh (Dance)
Hey, baby
Don't you wanna love, don't you wanna love me?

===== Whitney Houston - I Will Always Love You =====
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way
And I
Will always love you
I will always love you
You
My darling, you
Mm, mm
Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So goodbye, please, don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish to you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love
I will always love you, I
I will always love you, you
Darling, I love you
Ooh, I'll always
I'll always love you

===== Whitney Houston - I Have Nothing =====
Share my life, take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there?
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you
You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will our memories survive? One I can hold on to
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
Your love, I'll remember forever
Don't make me close one more door
Don't walk away from me, no
Don't you dare walk away from me
If I don't have you
You
Oh, you

===== Whitney Houston - How Will I Know =====
There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?
Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now, uh-huh
Said there's no mistakin'
What I feel is really love
Ooh, tell me
How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
If he loves me
If he loves me not (Mm)
(Ooh) If he loves me not
(Hey) If he loves me
If he loves me not
Oh, how will I know?
Hey, how will I know? (Ooh)
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know? (I say a prayer)
How will I know? Ooh
How will I know? (I fall in love)
Hey, how will I know?
I'm asking you
How will I, how will I know?

===== Whitney Houston - Greatest Love of All =====
I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me
I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all
I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love

===== Whitney Houston - My Love Is Your Love =====
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
(Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up)
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright (Oh)
If tomorrow is Judgement Day (Sing, mommy)
And I'm standing on the front line, mm
And the Lord ask me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright (It's alright)
If I wake up in World War 3 (World War 3)
(In World War 3)
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I wanna go home
It's okay (It's okay) if you're comin' with me
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright (Uh-huh)
If I lose my fame and fortune (Really don't mind)
And I'm homeless on the street (On the street, oh, Lord)
And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station (Ooh, okay)
It's okay if you're sleepin' with me
As the years, they pass us by (The years, the years, the years)
We stay young through each other's eyes (Each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get, oh
It's okay as long, as I got you, babe
And my love is your love (Your love, your love, baby)
And my love is your love (My love is your love)
If I should die this very day (Very, very day)
Don't cry (Don't cry), 'cause on Earth, we wasn't meant to stay
And no matter what people say (Really don't matter)
I'll be waiting for you after Judgement Day
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us (Can't hold us)
And my love is your love (Yes, it is)
It would take an eternity to break us (Break us, baby)
Clap your hands (Clap your hands)
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright (Clap your hands)
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright (I said the record is not over yet!)

===== Whitney Houston - Saving All My Love for You =====
A few stolen moments is all that we shared
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I try to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you
It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said, "Be patient, just wait a little longer."
But that's just an old fantasy
I've got to get ready
Just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for a feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love
Yes, I'm saving all my love for you
No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
Yeah, I'm saving all my loving
For you, for you

===== Whitney Houston - Where Do Broken Hearts Go =====
I know it's been some time
But there's something on my mind
You see, I haven't been the same
Since that cold November day
We said we needed space
But all we found was an empty place
And the only things I learned
Is that I need you desperately
So here I am
And can you please tell me, oh
Where do broken hearts go?
Can they find their way home
Back to the open arms
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you
Won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes
And I know that you still care, for me
Ooh, baby
I've been around enough to know
That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind
And now that I am here with you
I'll never let you go
I look into your eyes
And now I know, now I know
And I know that you still care
And I know that you still care for me, for me
You still care for me

===== Whitney Houston - It's Not Right, But It's Okay =====
Friday night, you and your boys went out to eat, oh
Then they hung out
But you came home around three
Yes, you did
If six of y'all went out, ah
Then four of you were really cheap, yeah
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, yeah (Ah)
I'm packing bags so you can leave town for a week
Yes, I am
The phone rings, and then you look at me
Why'd you turn and look at me?
You said it was one of your friends, down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 213 show up on your Caller I.D.? Oh
I've been through all of this before
I've been through all this before
So how could you think
Don't think about it, don't think about it
That I would stand around and take some more?
Get gone, get gone
Things are gonna change
Things are gonna change, baby
'Cause I won't be a fool anymore
You don't stand no chance, boy
That's why you have to leave
I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So don't turn around to see my face
Don't you turn around
There's no more tears left here for you to see
Was it really worth you going out like that? (Tell me, boy)
See, I'm movin' on
And I refuse to turn back, yeah (Back, back, yeah)
See, all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out, you were making a fool of me, oh
It's not right, but it's okay (Sho 'nuff okay, ha)
I'm gonna make it anyway (Make it anyway)
Pack your bags, up and leave (Pack your bags, get out and leave)
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me (Don't you dare, back to me, boy)
It's not right, but it's okay (It's not right, so okay)
I'm gonna make it anyway (I'm gonna, I'm gonna, ah)
Close the door behind you, leave your key (Close the door, and leave your key)
I'd rather be alone than unhappy (I'd rather be alone than unhappy, oh)
It's not right, but it's okay (It's not right, so okay, baby)
I'm gonna make it anyway (I can pay my own rent)
Pack your bags, up and leave (Pay my light bill, take care of my babies)
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me (Oh, oh, oh-whoa)
It's not right, but it's okay (Oh, lord) (Oh-oh-oh, ooh)
I'm gonna make it anyway (Get up and leave)
Close the door behind you, leave your key (Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I'd rather be alone than unhappy (I'd rather be alone than unhappy)
It's not right, but it's okay (I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright)
I'm gonna make it anyway (I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright)
Pack your bags, up and leave  (I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright)
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me (Things are gonna change)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
('Cause I won't be a fool anymore)
Close the door behind you, leave your key (I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright)
I'd rather be alone than unhappy (There's no more tears left here for you to see)
Don't you dare come running back to me
I'd rather be alone than unhappy

===== Whitney Houston - One Moment in Time =====
Each day I live
I want to be
A day to give
The best of me
I'm only one
But not alone
My finest day
Is yet unknown
I broke my heart
Fought every gain
To taste the sweet
I face the pain
I rise and fall
Yet through it all
This much remains
I want one moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment of time
I will feel
I will feel eternity, mm
I've lived to be
The very best
I want it all
No time for less
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance
Here in my hands
I will feel eternity, oh
You're a winner for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time
Make it shine
I will be
I will be free, oh
I will be free

===== Whitney Houston - Run to You =====
Ooh
I know that when you look at me
There's so much that you just don't see
But if you would only take the time
I know in my heart you'd find
Oh, a girl who's scared sometimes
Who isn't always strong
Can't you see the hurt in me?
I feel so all alone
I wanna run to you (Ooh-ooh)
I wanna run to you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Won't you hold me in your arms
And keep me safe from harm?
But if I come to you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Tell me, will you stay
Or will you run away?
Each day, each day I play the role
Of someone always in control
But at night, I come home and turn the key
There's nobody there, no one cares for me
Oh, what's the sense
Of trying hard to find your dreams
Without someone to share it with?
Tell me, what does it mean?
Run away
Oh, I need you here
I need you here to wipe away my tears
To kiss away my fears, no
If you only knew
How much
I wanna run to you
I'll run to you

===== Whitney Houston - I'm Every Woman =====
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
'Cause I'm every woman (Every woman)
It's all in me
Yeah
I'm every woman
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa (Oh), whoa (Oh), whoa
I can cast a spell
Secrets you can't tell
Mix a special brew
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly I will appear, oh
Oh, I can sense your needs
Like rain onto the seeds
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old-fashioned love
I've got it, I've got it
I've got it, got it, baby, baby
I'll do it, naturally
I ain't bragging
'Cause I'm the one
Just ask me
Ooh, it shall be done
And don't bother
To compare
I've got it
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Aah, yeah, yeah, got it)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Got it, got it, yeah)
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Aah, aah, aah)
I'm every woman (I'm every woman)
I'm every woman (Every need, baby)
I'm every woman (Oh)
I'm every woman (Every woman, baby)
I'm every woman (Uuh)
I'm every woman (Chaka)
I'm every woman (My girl)

===== Whitney Houston - Didn't We Almost Have It All =====
Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it
Once again, we can take the night into tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you, I feel it all again
Didn't we almost have it all
When love was all we had worth giving?
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
Loving you makes life worth living
Didn't we almost have it all?
The nights we held on 'til the morning
You know you'll never love that way again
The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together down the line
A moment in the soul can last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again
Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new?
Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you?
We'll never lose it again
Because once you know what love is
You never let it end

===== Whitney Houston - So Emotional =====
I don't know why I like it, huh
I just do
Woo, ooh
Ooh
I've been hearin' your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photo right beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head, uh
I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good?
I got a love of my own, babe
I shouldn't get so hung up on you
I remember the way that we touched
I wish I didn't like it so much
Ah, uh
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
Ain't it shocking what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what love can do? Hee
I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby
I gotta watch you walk out, yes, I do
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk, I just watch your mouth
Oh, I remember the way that we touched
Ain't it shocking, love can do
Hee-hee
Uh
Ha
Can you work on me? Work on me
Haha
See, I remember the way that we touched
No, no, no
I get so emotional
I get so emotional, baby (Oh, baby)
Shocking what love can do (Do-do-do-do-do)
I get so emotional, baby (Hey, yeah, baby, baby, baby)
Every time I think of you (Baby, baby, baby)
I get so emotional, baby (Oh)
Ain't it shocking what love can do? You know what it does
I get so emotional, baby (Yeah, babe, yeah, baby)
Every time I think of you (You know what I mean, hee, hee, hoo)
I get so emotional, baby (Hey, yeah, baby)
Shocking what love can do, ooh-ooh

===== Whitney Houston - I Look to You =====
As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all
Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to?
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you, I can be strong
I look to you, yeah
And when melodies are gone
In you, I hear a song
About to lose my breath
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door
And every road that I've taken, mm
Led to my regret
And I don't know if I'm gon' make it
Nothing to do but lift my head
And when all my strength is gone
I look to you, oh yeah
My levees are broken (Oh Lord)
My walls have come (Coming down on me)
They're crumbling down on me (All the rain is falling)
The rain is falling (Woo)
Defeat is calling (Set me free)
I need you to set me free
Take me far away from the battle
I need you
Shine on me
I look to you, ooh

===== Whitney Houston - Do You Hear What I Hear? =====
Do you hear what I hear?
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear? (Hear what I hear)
Ringing through the night, shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear (Hear what I hear)
A song, a song, high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know (Know what I know)
In your palace warm, mighty king
A child, a child, shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold, oh yeah, oh
Said the king to the people everywhere, yeah
Listen to what I say (To what I say)
Pray for peace (Peace), people everywhere
Oh, a child, a child, sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light, yes He will
I know He will, oh, yes He will
(Do you hear what I hear?)
Do you hear? Do you hear?
Do you hear? Do you know?
What I know, what I hear
What I hear, do you know, do you know?
Do you know, do you know?

===== Whitney Houston - All at Once =====
All at once
I finally took a moment and I'm realizing that
You're not coming back
And it finally hit me all at once
I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were shattered all at once
Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
I looked around and found that you were with another love
In someone else's arms
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once
The smile that used to greet me brightened someone else's day
She took your smile away
And left me with just memories, all at once

===== Whitney Houston - I'm Your Baby Tonight =====
From the moment I saw you
I went outta my mind
Oh, I never believed in love at first sight
But you got a magic, boy
That I just can't explain
Well, you got a, you got a way that you're making me feel
I can do, I can do anything for you, baby
I'll be down for you, baby
Lay all my cards out tonight
Just call on me, baby
I'll be there in a hurry
It's your move, so baby
Baby, decide
Whatever you want from me
I'm giving you everything
I'm your baby tonight
You've given me ecstasy
You are my fantasy
From the second you touched me
I was ready to die
I've never been fatal
You're my first time
I feel like an angel
Who just started to fly
I can feel, I can do anything for you, baby (Woo)
I will fly for you, baby
Hold on and enjoy the ride
I'm not in no hurry
We can fly all night, baby
It's your move, now, baby
Baby, let's fly
Whatever you want from me (Me)
I'm giving you everything (Everything)
I'm your baby tonight (I'm your baby)
You've given me ecstasy (Ecstasy)
You are my fantasy (Fantasy)
Whatever you want from me (Whatever)
I'm giving you everything (You want, boy)
I'm your baby tonight (I'll be your baby, I will be your baby)
You are my fantasy (You are, boy)
I'm your baby tonight (I'm here for you, baby)
Whatever I do, boy
It's all about you, baby
And ain't it the truth, boy?
I'm helplessly in love with you
What else can I do, boy
But be there for you, baby?
You got a, you got a way that you're making me feel
I can feel, I can do any, do anything
Oh, yeah
Yeah, baby
You know (Alright)
Alright, you know it, baby
You know, whatever
I'm giving you everything (Whatever)
I'm your baby tonight (You know, boy)
You've given me ecstasy (Oh yeah, baby)
You are my fantasy (You know this, boy)
I'm your baby tonight (You know this boy, oh)
Looks like I'm fatal, it's all on the table
And baby, you hold the cards
You got the magic and I gotta have it
I don't want the pieces, I want every single part
I'll be your angel, I'm ready and able
Whatever you want is fine
Whenever you're ready, just call on your lady
I'll be your baby tonight, yeah
Whatever you want from me (Whatever you want, whatever you want)
I'm giving you everything (You want from me, baby)
You've given me ecstasy (Whatever you want, whatever you want)
You are my fantasy (You want from me, baby)
I'm your baby tonight (You can have it)

===== Whitney Houston - Million Dollar Bill =====
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Came in the door, checked in my coat
And who I'm looking for is staring in my face, oh
They played our song, we hit the floor, he held me strong
And we danced the night away, oh
I can see the way that he's making me feel
This way about his love
I've been looking for something like this
I'm saying, "Oh, oh, oh, oh"
If he make you feel like a million dollar bill
Say, "Oh, oh, oh", say, "Oh, oh, oh"
Makes you go left, right, up, down
Got you spinnin' 'round and round
Say, "Oh, oh, oh", say, "Aww, baby"
It's been a long, long time
Since I felt that love has found my way, oh, oh, oh
I've been lookin' (Looking)
I've been searchin' (Searching)
For the man to touch this place
Oh, yeah
Can’t deny the way that he's making feel
I've been searching for something like this
Got you spinnin' 'round and 'round
If he make you feel like a million dollar bill (If he makes you feel)
If you feel good
If you're feeling good
Put one hand in the air
Say, "Yeah" (Yeah)
It's 'cause love is in the air
Love is in the air (Oh yeah)
Say, "oh, oh, oh", say, "aww, baby"
Ohh
Oh, if he makes you feel
Oh, if he makes you feel (Yeah, yeah)
C'mon and say
"Oh
Aww, baby"

===== Whitney Houston - Exhale (Shoop Shoop) =====
Everyone falls in love sometime
Sometimes it's wrong
And sometimes it's right
For every win
Someone must fail
But there comes a point when
When we exhale (Yeah, yeah, say)
Shoop, Shoop, Shoop
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Yeah)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop
(All you got to say is shoo be doop)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo be doop)
Shoo Be Doo
Sometimes you'll laugh
Sometimes you'll cry
Life never tells us
The when's or why's
When you've got friends to wish you well
You'll find a point when
You will exhale (Yeah, yeah, say)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo shoo shoo huh)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Say shoop say shoo be say shoo be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Say shoo-hoo say sho)
Shoo Be Doo (Be doo oh)
Hearts are often broken
When there are words unspoken
In your soul there's
Answers to your prayers
If you're searching for
A place you know
A familiar face
Somewhere to go
You should look inside yourself
You're halfway there
Shoop, Shoop, Shoop (Shoo Be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo Be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo-hoo-hoo be)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Shoo be doop doop doop hoo hoo hoo)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (Do do shoo be shoo be feels alright)
Shoo Be Doop Shoop Shoop (You can say oh)

===== Katy Perry - Dark Horse =====
Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh-huh, let's rage
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy (Enemy)
Your enemy (Your enemy), your enemy
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no goin' back
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away (Walk away)
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me
She's a beast, I call her Karma (Come back)
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer (Woo)
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty heart is on steroids 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her (Meet her)
If you get the chance, you better keep her (Keep her)
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer (Freezer)
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleepin' beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair (A fair)
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for (You should know)
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse (Like a dark horse)
Are you ready for, ready for (Ready for)
A perfect storm, perfect storm? (A perfect storm)

===== Katy Perry - Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.) =====
There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn
Last Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night, we went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah
But this Friday night
Do it all again
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail
Do it all again (Do it all again)
This Friday night
T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F

===== Katy Perry - Roar =====
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're gonna hear me roar
Now I'm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero
You held me down, but I got up (Got up)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (You'll hear me roar)
Roar-oar, roar-oar, roar
Oh, louder, louder than a lion
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah)

===== Katy Perry - Firework =====
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
"Boom, boom, boom"
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it throu-ou-ough
Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe,"

===== Katy Perry - The One That Got Away =====
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse
But in another life
The one
All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, woah
'Cause now I pay the price
The one that got away (The one that got away)
The one (The one)

===== Katy Perry - Hot N Cold =====
You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS
Like a bitch, I would know
And you overthink
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me
'Cause you're hot, then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot, then you're cold
We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery
Used to laugh (Used to laugh) 'bout nothing ('Bout nothing)
Now you're plain (Now you're plain) boring (Boring)
I should know (I should know)
That you're not gonna change
(You) You don't really wanna stay, no (Oh)
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o (Oh)
You're up, then you're down (Down)
Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride
You're hot, then you're cold (Oh-oh-oh)
You're wrong when it's right (Oh-oh-oh)

===== Katy Perry - I Kissed A Girl =====
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

===== Katy Perry - California Gurls =====
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be somethin' in the water
Sippin' gin and juice

===== Katy Perry - Teenage Dream =====
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
You make me feel like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream, the way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
You make me feel like I'm livin' a (You make me)
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back (No)
This is real, so take a chance (Oh-oh)

===== Katy Perry - Unconditionally =====
Oh no, did I get too close?
Oh, did I almost see what's really on the inside?
All your insecurities
All the dirty laundry
Never made me blink one time
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
So come just as you are to me
Don't need apologies
Know that you are worthy
I'll take your bad days with your good
Walk through the storm, I would
I'd do it all because I love you
I love you
So open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart and just let it begin
Open up your heart
Acceptance is the key to be
To be truly free
Will you do the same for me?
And there is no fear now
'Cause I will love you unconditionally, oh yeah
I will love you (Unconditionally)
I will love you

===== Katy Perry - Never Really Over =====
I'm losing my self-control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you
Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Guess it's never really over
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name
I think of you
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah
(And I'll have to get over you all over again)
(Over you all over again)
I guess it's never really over

===== Katy Perry - Part Of Me =====
Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me drown
Now look at me, I'm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowing, oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact, you can keep everything, yeah, yeah
Except for me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no (Away from me)
But you're not gonna break my soul (My soul)
This is the part of me (No)
Away from me (No)
(No)

===== Katy Perry - Chained To The Rhythm =====
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So put (So put) your rose-colored glasses on
Turn it up, it's your favorite song (Oh)
To the rhythm, to the rhythm (Woah, oh, oh)
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ayy, up inna your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling and we about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions (Woo!)
Turn it up, keep it on repeat (Turn it up, turn it up, yeah)
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie (Like a wasted zombie)
Drink, this one's on me (Oh, we're all)
We're all chained to the rhythm (Oh, we're all)
To the rhythm, to the rhythm (Chained to the rhythm)
It goes on and on and on (Turn it up, it goes)
It goes on and on and on (Turn it up, it goes on and on and on)
It goes on and on and on (On and on and on, it goes)
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm

===== Katy Perry - Harleys In Hawaii =====
Boy, tell me, can you take my breath away?
Cruisin' down a heart-shaped highway
Got you swervin' lane-to-lane, don't hit the brakes
'Cause I'm feelin' so safe
I'll be your baby, on a Sunday
Oh, why don't we get out of town?
Call me your baby, on the same wave
Oh, no, no, there's no slowin' down
You and I, I
Ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i
I'm on the back, I'm holdin' tight, I
Want you to take me for a ri-ide, ride
When I hula-hula, hula
So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler
There's pink and purple in the sky-y-y
We're ridin' Harleys in Hawaii-i-i (Ha)
Let me run my fingers through your salty hair
Go ahead, explore the island
Vibes so real that you can feel it in the air
I'm revvin' up your engine
Oh, why don't we get out of town? (Why don't we get out of town?)
Call me your baby, catch the same wave
Oh, no, no, there's no slowin' down (Let's go)
So good, you'll take me to the jeweler-jeweler, jeweler (Jeweler)
There's pink and purple in the sky-y-y (No, no ,no)

===== Katy Perry - Wide Awake =====
I'm wide awake
(I'm wide awake)
Yeah, I was in the dark
I was falling hard with an open heart
How did I read the stars so wrong?
And now it's clear to me
That everything you see ain't always what it seems
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long
I wish I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete
Fallin' from cloud nine
Crashin' from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah, I'm fallin' from cloud nine
Not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece and landed on my feet
Need nothing to complete myself, no
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den, I don't have to pretend
(And it's too late)
The story's over now, the end
Fallin' from cloud nine (It was outta the blue, I'm)
I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm fallin' from cloud nine
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake)
I am tryin' to hold on
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore
Yeah, I'm fallin' from cloud nine (It was outta the blue, I'm)
You know I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)

They know what is what
But they don't know what is what
They just strut
What the fuck?
A tiger
Don't lose no sleep
Don't need opinions
From a shellfish or a sheep
Don't you come for me
No, not today
You're calculated
I got your number
'Cause you're a joker
And I'm a courtside killer queen
And you will kiss the ring
You best believe
So keep calm, honey, I'ma stick around
For more than a minute, get used to it
Funny my name keeps comin' out your mouth
'Cause I stay winnin', lay 'em up like
Swish, swish, bish
Another one in the basket
Can't touch this
Another one in the casket
Your game is tired
You should retire
You're 'bout as cute as
An old coupon expired
And karma's not a liar
She keeps receipts
Another one in the casket (Let's go)
But they don't know what is what (Katy Perry, what)
They just, know what is what (Young Money)
But they don't know what is what (What)
They just, know what is what
What the fuck? (Yo)
Pink Ferragamo sliders on deck
Silly rap beefs just get me more checks
My life is a movie, I'm never off set
Me and my amigos, no, not Offset
Swish swish, aw, I got them upset
But my shooters'll make 'em dance like dubstep
Swish, swish, aw, my haters is obsessed
'Cause I make M's, they get much less
Don't be tryna double back, I already despise you (Yeah)
All that fake love you showin' couldn't even disguise you
Yo, yo
Ran? When? Nicki gettin' tan
Mirror, mirror, who's the fairest bitch in all the land?
Damn, man, this bitch is a Stan
The generous queen'll kiss a fan
Ass goodbye, I'ma be ridin' by
I'ma tell my **** Biggz, yeah, that's the guy
A star's a star, da-ha-da-ha
They never thought the swish god would take it this far
Get my pimp cup, this is pimp shit, baby
I only rock with Queens, so I'm makin' hits with Katy
Another one in the basket (And another one, and another one)
Can't touch this (Can't touch this)
Another one in the casket (And another one, and another one)
They know what is what (Do they know?)

===== Katy Perry - E.T. =====
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing
They say, "Be afraid"
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic
This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all
All

===== Backstreet Boys - As Long as You Love Me =====
As long as you love me
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Riskin' it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me
I don't care who you are
Where you're from, what you did
Who you are, where you're from
Don't care what you did
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me (Oooh, ooh-ooh)
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be
I don't care who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
What you did, as long as you love me (I know)
Who you are (Who you are)

What you did, as long as you love me
Don't care what you did (Yeah-eh-eh)

That I've become, oh yeah
Looking back on the things I've done

Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
Quit playing games with my heart
Quit playing games with my heart (With my heart)
Before you tear us apart (My heart)

All you people, can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?

===== Backstreet Boys - Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely =====
Show me the meaning of being lonely
So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's somethin' missin' in my heart
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There's no control, are you with me now?
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? (tell me why)
There's somethin' missin' in my heart (heart!)
There's nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you're askin' me
To feel the things you never show?
(Show-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh!)
You are missin' in my heart
Tell me, why can't I be there where you are?
Show me the meaning of being lonely (Being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? (Tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are (Where you are)

===== Backstreet Boys - Incomplete =====
Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you, within me, I can't find no rest
Where I'm going, is anybody's guess
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I'm awake, but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I'm going to be is
Incomplete
Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it's written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake
I’m awake, but my world is half asleep
I don't mean to drag it on
But I can't seem to let you go
I don't wanna make you face this world alone
I wanna let you go
(Alone, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Going to be is)

===== Backstreet Boys - Drowning =====
Oh-oh yeah
Don't pretend you're sorry
I know you're not
You know you got the power
To make me weak inside
And girl you leave me breathless
But it's okay
'Cause you are my survival
Now hear me say
I can't imagine
Life without your love
And even forever
Don't seem like long enough
'Cause every time I breathe I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
And every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
You keep drowning in your love
Maybe I'm a drifter
Maybe not
'Cause I have known the safety
Of floating freely in your arms
And I don't need another lifeline
It's not for me
'Cause only you can save me
Oh-oh, can't you see
(Don't seem like long enough, yeah)
And every time I try to rise above (rise above)
Go on and pull me under
Cover me with dreams, yeah
Love me mouth to mouth now
You know I can't resist
'Cause you're the air that I breathe
Every time I breathe I take you in
('Cause every time I breathe, yeah)
Baby I can't help it (baby I can't help it)
I'm swept away by love (by love)
Baby I can't help it (can't help it)
You keep me drowning in your love (love, yeah-yeah)
(Keep me drowning in your love)
Got me drowning (oh-oh-oh)
Got me drowning
(Can't help it, can't help it, no-no)
'Cause every time I breathe I take you in (I do)
And my heart beats again (oh-yeah!)

===== Backstreet Boys - The Call =====
"Hello"
"Hi, it's me. Wassup baby?
I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight
So, don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"W-Wait? Say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really dropping out. I think my battery must be low
Listen, if you can hear me, we're going to a place nearby, alright? Gotta go!"
Let me tell you the story
'Bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home
When there she was, standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should've said, "No, someone's waiting for me"
But I called my girl up and said
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell ya don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me"
"Say again? You're dropping out, my battery is low
Just so you know, we're going to a place nearby
Gotta go!"
Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out
That she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside
That she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied
Listen baby I'm sorry (hello?)
Gotta go
Oh (oh-oh-oh)
Oh (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go, oh-oh-oh!
"Listen, baby, I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
Just wanna tell ya don't worry (don't worry)
We're going to a place nearby

But I'll be there to make you smile
I don't have a fancy car to get to you
I'd walk a thousand miles
I don't care if he buys you nice things
Does his gifts come from the heart?
I don't know, but if you were my girl
I'd make it so we'd never be apart
But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I could live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give (Give)
When you talk (When you talk)
Does it seem like he's not
Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay baby, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away

When you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby, please, I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine
But love is all I have to give (Oh-oh, to you)
(Hey girl) Hey girl
I don't want you to cry no more inside

===== Backstreet Boys - Don't Go Breaking My Heart =====
I got mixed emotions
Did I finally find me a river
That could lead me out to the ocean?
'Cause I've only ever known the kind of love
That leaves you battered and broken
So forgive me for my mixed emotions, yeah yeah
I'm not that kind of person
Who can fall in and out of love with you
That's not what love's supposed to do
Baby, don't go breaking my heart, breaking my heart
'Cause it's the only one I've got
Am I being too open?
'Cause I told you everything I have to say
And now we're having a moment
Does it make you wanna pack up all your things
And drive away like you stole it?
Just forgive me if I'm being too open
No no no no, yeah yeah yeah
(What love's supposed to do)
I've been broken, I've been bruised
But now I'm all in 'cause of you

Then do it to a heart that isn't mine

===== Backstreet Boys - The One =====
I'll be the one
I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more than mysteries and lies
There you are, wild and free
Reaching out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night
I'll be the one (I'll be the one)
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light (I'll be the light)
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
To hold you

We can share our dreams coming true

And make sure that you will be alright

===== Backstreet Boys - No Place =====
I've been to Paris, made my way down to Rome
Seen the sun setting on the beach in Mexico
But I could care less, 'cause I was all alone
And there ain't no way to touch your body over the phone
I've been all around the world, done all there is to do
But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
You're my daybreak, you're my California sun
You're my Memphis, New York, New Orleans all rolled into one
In the city, the country, the mountains or sea
Wherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you, no
There ain't no place (No place, no place)
Ooh, yeah, ain't no place

Oooh baby, you're so fine

Your lips they taste so sweet
Bang bang bang

It's the Fun Factory with the BSB's
All the girls get on your knees
Tryin' to scream or touch me please
Backstreet Boys, are you with it? (Yeah)
AJ, hit it
Come on, girl and get down
Smack it up, flip it, and move it all around
Here it is if you wanna get with this
Put you on the top of my list, uh!

And move it all around (You better move around)
And move it all around (Hey yeah!)

Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh!

Get down, get down, yeah

===== Backstreet Boys - Chances =====
What if I never run into you?
What if you never smiled at me?
What if I had noticed you too?
And you never showed up where I happened to be
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a quiet night, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
I could have just walked by, who would have thought?
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
I could have found you, put my arms around you
What are the chances?
What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me? Oh
Of all of the plans that I could have made
Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh
In a crowded room, what are the odds?
(What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?)
Getting close to you, but here we are
That I could have found you, put my arms around you
Is it love? Is it fate?
Who am I? Who's to say?
Don't know exactly what it means (Ooh, oh, yeah)
''Is it love? Is it fate?''
''Where it leads, who can say?''
''Maybe you and I were meant to be''
What, what
Two in a million, once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you (My arms around you)
Two in a million (It's like two in a million), once in a life, yeah (Woah)
What are the chances? (What are the chances?)
And what if you never smiled at me?

===== Backstreet Boys - More Than That =====
I can see that you've been crying
You can't hide it with a lie
What's the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong?
I heard him promise you forever
But forever's come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lines
Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words, then take them back
Don't give loneliness a chance
Baby, listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that
Baby, you deserve much better
What's the use in holding on?
Don't you see it's now or never
'Cause I just can't be friends
Baby, knowing in the end
That I will love you more than that
(Can't take them back)
Baby, listen to me when I say (hey!)
There's not a day that passes by
I don't wonder why we haven't tried
It's not too late to change your mind
So take my hand, don't say goodbye
I won't say the words, (no-no) then take them back
Oh, I will love you more than that (more than that)
I won't say the words, then take them back (back)
Don't give loneliness a chance (a chance)

===== Backstreet Boys - Inconsolable =====
I close the door
Like so many times, so many times before
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor
I wanna let you walk away tonight
Without a word
I try to sleep, yeah
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me
A thousand more regrets unraveling, oh!
If you were here right now
I swear I'd tell you this
Baby, I don't wanna waste another day
Keeping it inside is killing me
'Cause all I ever wanted
Comes right down to you, to you
I wish that I could find the words to say
Baby, I would tell you
Every time you leave I'm inconsolable
I climb the walls, yeah
I can see the edge, but I can't take the fall, no
I've memorized the number
So why can't I make the call?
Maybe 'cause I know you will always be with me
In the possibility, oh-oh-oh!
(Another day)
(Oh-no, no-no!)
I don't wanna be like this
I just wanna let you now
That everything that I hold in
Is everything I can't let go
Oh-oh, oh! I can't let go
Yeah, 'cause baby
I don't wanna waste another day (waste another day)
Keeping it inside is killing me (is killing me 'cause)
'Cause all I ever wanted (all I ever wanted)
Comes right down
To you (to you), to you (to you)
(No-no-no)
Don't you know it baby
I don't wanna waste another day
Yeah-yeah (yeah-yeah-yeah!)
Oh, I'm inconsolable
Whoa, yeah, oh-oh
I'm inconsolable (yeah)

===== Prince - Purple Rain =====
I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted, one time, to see you laughing
I only want to see you laughing
In the purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only want to see you bathing
I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend, hey
Baby, I could never steal you from another
It's such a shame our friendship had to end
I only want to see you underneath the purple rain
Honey, I know, I know, I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out for something new
That means you, too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain, yeah
Purple rain, purple rain, wooo!
If you know what I'm singing about up here
Come on, raise your hand
I only want to see you
Only want to see you in the purple rain

===== Prince - Kiss =====
Uh!
You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on
I just need your body, baby, from dusk 'til dawn
You don't need experience to turn me out
You just leave it all up to me, I'm gonna show you what it's all about
You don't have to be rich to be my girl
You don't have to be cool to rule my world
Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with
I just want your extra time and your kiss
You got to not talk dirty, baby, if you wanna impress me
You can't be too flirty, mama, I know how to undress me, yeah
I want to be your fantasy, maybe you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me, we could have a good time, oh
Yes, oh, I think I wanna dance, uh
Oh!
Gotta, gotta, oh
Little Girl Wendy's Parade
Gotta, gotta, gotta
Women, not girls, rule my world, I said they rule my world
Act your age, mama, not your shoe size, maybe we could do the twirl
You don't have to watch “Dynasty” to have an attitude, uh
You just leave it all up to me, my love will be your food
Yeah, you don't have to be rich to be my girl
Ain't no particular sign I'm compatible with

===== Prince - When Doves Cry =====
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dig, if you will, the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you, my darling, can you picture this?
Dream, if you can, a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me and you
How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
Touch, if you will, my stomach (Hmm)
Feel how it trembles inside (Mhm)
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you, even doves have pride
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Yeah, yeah
Doo-doo, woah-oh
(Yeah, yeah)
Alone in a world that's so cold? (World that's so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding (Maybe, maybe)
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold (My father, you know he's cruel)
Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (Never, never satisfied, why scream?)
Why do we scream at each other? (Why?)
When doves cry (When doves cry, when doves cry)
When doves cry (When doves cry, they cry)
Oh, no, oh
Oh, no, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
When doves cry (Hoo)
Baby, baby, baby, yeah
Don't cry
Darling, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't, don't cry

===== Prince - Raspberry Beret =====
One, two
One, two, three, uh!
Yeah
I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely
Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door
She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her
Built like she was, she had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike and, uh, we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said, now, overcast days never turned me on
But something 'bout the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright, but I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again, ooh
I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause, baby, I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then
(Raspberry beret) Oh!
The kind you find (The kind you find)
The kind you find (In a second-hand store)
Oh, no, no
(Raspberry beret)
(And if it was warm)
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)
Yeah (Raspberry beret)
Aah!
I think I, I think I, I think I love her!
No, no, no
No, no, no (The kind you find)
(In a second-hand store)
Tell me
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more)
Ooh, uh, I think I love

===== Prince - Let's Go Crazy =====
Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called "life"
Electric word, life
It means forever, and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you there's something else:
The afterworld
A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night
So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-All-Right
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, babe
'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own
And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor)
Whoo
If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see, I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
"Ah, ah," is all I heard
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no, let's go
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go
Come..
We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (When we do)
What's it all for? (What's it all for?)
You better live now
'Fore the grim reaper come knocking on your door
Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Look for the purple banana
C'mon, baby
Yeah
(Crazy)
Go (Go crazy)
Whoo!
I said let's go crazy (Go crazy)
Let's go (Let's go)
Go (Let's go)
Dr. Everything'll-Be-All-Right
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough, children
He's coming
Coming
Take me away

===== Prince - I Wanna Be Your Lover =====
I ain't got no money
I ain't like those other guys you hang around
It's kind of funny
But they always seem to let you down
And I get discouraged
'Cause I never see you anymore
And I need your love, babe, yeah
That's all I'm living for, yeah
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby
But all I ever wanted to do
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long, make you shout
Oh, lover!
Yeah, I wanna be the only one you come for
I wanna be your brother
I wanna be your mother and your sister, too
There ain't no other
That can do the things that I'll do to you
'Cause you treat me just like a child
And they say I'm so shy, yeah
But with you, I just go wild, woo!
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby, no
Yeah, I wanna be the only one you come for, yeah

===== Prince - I Would Die 4 U =====
I'm not a woman, I'm not a man
I am something that you'll never understand
I'll never beat you, I never lie
And if you're evil, I'll forgive you by and by, 'cause
You, I would die for you, yeah
Darling, if you want me to
You, I would die for you
I'm not your lover, I'm not your friend
I am something that you'll never comprehend
No need to worry, no need to cry
I'm your Messiah, and you're the reason why, 'cause
You, I would die for you, woo
You're just a sinner, I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad
I'm not a human, I'm a dove
I'm your conscience, I am love
All I really need is to know that you believe
Yeah, I would die for you, yeah
Yeah, say one more time
Two, three, four, you
I would die for you

===== Prince - Little Red Corvette =====
I guess I should've known by the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, you're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
I guess I must be dumb 'cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And you say,  "What have I got to lose?"
And, honey, I say, little red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast (Oh)
Little red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last
I guess I should've closed my eyes when you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill when I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me
Believe it or not, I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class
And you say, "Baby, have you got enough gas?"
Oh, yeah!
Baby, you're much too fast
(Yes, you are)
You need to find a love that's gonna last
(Oh, oh)
Ooh, oooh, oooh
A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby, gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine
Need to find a love that's gonna last, hey hey
Honey, you got to slow down (Got to slow down)
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your little red Corvette right in the ground
(Little red Corvette)
Right down to the ground (Honey, you got to slow down)
You, you, you got to slow down
You're movin' much too fast, too fast
Need to find a love that's gonna last
Girl, you got an ass like I never seen, ow!
And the ride
I say the ride is so smooth, you must be a limousine
Ow!
You need a love, you need a love that's, uh, that's gonna last
Babe, you got to slow down (You got to slow down)
'Cause if you don't, 'cause if you don't
You're gonna run your body right into the ground (Right into the ground)
Right into the ground (Right into the ground)

===== Prince - Cream =====
Mmmmmm
Ooow!
This is it
It's time for you to go to the wire
You will hit
'Cause you got the burning desire
It's your time (Time)
You got the horn, so why don't you blow it?
You are fine (Fine)
You're filthy cute, and, baby, you know it
Oooh
Cream
Get on top
You will cop
Don't you stop
Sh-boogie bop
You're so good
Baby, there ain't nobody better (Ain't nobody better)
So you should
Never, ever go by the letter (Never, ever)
You're so cool (Cool)
Everything you do is success (Oooh-ooh-ooh)
Make the rules (Rules)
Then break them all 'cause you are the best
(Yes, you are)
Look up in the air, it's your guitar
Hey, ah-ah
Do your dance
Why should you wait any longer?
Take your chance
It could only make you stronger
It's your time (It's your time)
You got the horn, so why don't you blow it? (Go on and blow it)
You're so fine (You're so fine)
You're filthy cute, and, baby, you know it (You know it and you know it)
Come on
Don't you ever stop
Ah, cream
Right there
Boogie, ah heh-heh-heh
Cream, baby

===== Prince - Nothing Compares 2 U =====
It's been seven hours and thirteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues
'Cause nothing compares
No, nothing compares to you
Nothing, nothing
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every girl I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said, "Boy, you better try to have fun no matter what you do"
But he's a fool
All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard
All died when you went away
I know that living with me, baby, was some kind of hard
But I'm willing to give it another try
I said nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

===== Prince - Sign O' The Times =====
Oh, yeah
In France, a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same
At home, there are seventeen-year-old boys and their idea of fun is being in a gang called The Disciples, high on crack, totin' a machine gun
Time
Times
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church and killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story is tellin' you somebody died
Sister killed her baby 'cause she couldn't afford to feed it
And we're sending people to the moon
In September, my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse; it's June
It's silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh, why?
Baby, make a speech, star wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn
Is it silly, no?
When a rocket blows up
Some say man ain't happy, truly
Until a man truly dies
Sign o' the times
Sign o' the times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's too late
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby
We'll call him Nate if it's a boy
Time, times
Times, time

===== Prince - Diamonds and Pearls =====
This will be the day
That you will hear me say
That I will never run away
I am here for you
Love is meant for two
Now tell me what you're gonna do
If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
If I could, I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love
Which one of us is right
If we always fight?
Why can't we just let love decide (Let love decide)?
Am I the weaker man
Because I understand
That love must be the master plan (Love is the master plan)?
D to the I to the A to the M
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love
D to the I to the A to the M (To the M)
There will come a time (There'll come a time)
When love will blow your mind (Blow your mind)
And everything you'll look for you'll find (Take a look inside, yeah)
That will be the time (That will be the time)
That everything will shine (Forever)
So bright it makes you colorblind (You will be colorblind)
If I gave you diamonds and pearls (Pearls, yeah, yeah)
If I could, I would give you the world (Give you the world)
All I can do is just offer you my love (All I can do)
If I gave you diamonds and pearls (Diamonds)
Would you be, would you, would you, a happy boy or a girl?
(Would ya, would ya, would ya be happy, little baby?)

===== Prince - Darling Nikki =====
I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said, "How'd you like to waste some time?"
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind
She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said, "Sign your name on the dotted line"
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind
Nikki
The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her loving will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sure enough, sure enough
Show you how to grind
Darling Nikki, oh
Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over, and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said, "Thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you wanna grind"
Oh, Nikki, oh
Come back, Nikki, come back
Your dirty little Prince
Wants to grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind
Hello, how are you? I'm fine 'cause I know
That the Lord is coming soon, coming, coming soon

===== Prince - The Beautiful Ones =====
Baby, baby, baby
What's it gonna be?
Is it him, or is it me?
Don't make me waste my time
Don't make me lose my mind, baby
Can't you stay with me tonight?
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Don't my kisses please you right?
You were so hard to find
The beautiful ones, they hurt you every time
Paint a perfect picture
Bring to life
The vision in one's mind
The beautiful ones
Always smash the picture
Always, every time
If I told you, baby
That I was in love with you
If we got married
Would that be cool?
You make me so confused
The beautiful ones, you always seem to lose
Baby, baby, baby, baby
What's it gonna be, baby?
Do you want him?
Or do you want me?
'Cause I want you
Say I want you
Tell me, baby
Do you want me?
I gotta know
Can I tell you a story?
Sometimes you lose
Let me tell you
Sometimes
Sometimes you win
Yes, you do
I say sometimes
I get so confused
Yes, I do
But I say right now
Right now
I know what I want
I want you
Listen to me
I may not know where I'm going, baby, woo!
Look here
I said, I may not know what I need
One thing
One thing's for certain, baby
I know what I want, yeah
And it's to please you, baby
Please you, baby
I'm begging down on my knees
Yeah
I want you, woo!

===== Prince - The Most Beautiful Girl In the World =====
Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world?
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
When the day turns into
The last day of all time
I can say I hope you are in
These arms of mine
And when the night falls before that day
I will cry, I will cry
Tears of joy, 'cause after you
All one can do is die, oh
Could you be?
Oh, yes, you are
How can I get through days
When I can't get through hours?
I can try, but when I do
I see you and I'm devoured, oh, yes
Who'd allow, who'd allow
A face to be soft as a flower? Oh
I could bow (Bow down)
And feel proud in the light of this power
Oh, oh, yes, oh
Could you be, could you be
And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be, uh, too far behind
'Cause baby, this kind of beauty
Has got no reason to ever be shy
'Cause honey, this kind of beauty
Is the kind that comes from inside
Could you be (Could you be?)
So beautiful, beautiful
It's plain to see, plain to see
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah! (Oh, yes, you are)
Girl (Could you be?)
You must be, oh, yeah!
(Could you be?)
You're the reason, oh, yeah
(Could, could, could)

===== Prince - Controversy =====
I just can't believe all the things people say
Controversy
Am I black or white?
Am I straight or gay?
Do I believe in God?
Do I believe in me?
Yeah, uh, uh, controversy
I can't understand human curiosity
Was it good for you?
Was I what you wanted me to be?
Do you get high?
Does your daddy cry?
Uh, uh, controversy
Do I believe in me? (Yeah, ooh, yeah)
Some people wanna die
So they can be free
I said life is just a game
We're all just the same (Do you wanna play?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, controversy
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever
Love him, love him, baby
Oh, yeah, yeah, controversy
Everybody, controversy, oh, yeah
Listen
People call me rude
I wish we all were nude
I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules
People call me rude, I wish we all were nude

Controversy (Oh, yeah)
Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me? Let me tell you

Just say the word and I'm gone
Honey, I know ain't nothin' wrong with your ears (Oh)
Better look now, or it just might be too late
(Just might be too late)
My luck's gon' change tonight
There's gotta be a better life
Take a picture, sweetie, I ain't got time to wait!
Oh, baby, I'm a (Star!) Woo! Ooh!
You might not know it now
Baby, but I are, I'm a star! Woo! (No!)
Everybody say nothing come too easy
When you got it, baby, nothing come too hard
You'll see what I'm all about (See what I'm all about)
If I gotta scream and shout (If I gotta scream and shout)
Baby, baby (Baby), baby (Baby), baby (Baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! (Star!)
Ooh, might not know it now
Baby, but I are, I'm a (Star!) Woo! Ooh...
Sing it! (Star!)
Ooooh, baby, baby, baby
Oh, baby, I'm a...(Star!)
Somebody (We are a star, yeah!)
Oooh!
Woo!
(Baby, I'm a star)
We are a star, yeah! (Hoo)
Star, ooh! (Baby, I'm a star)
We are a star, yeah!
Doctor!
Baby, baby, baby, baby - ooh!
We are a star!

===== Prince - U Got The Look =====
Here we are, folks
The dream we all dream of
Boy versus girl in the world series of love
Tell me, have you got the look?
You walked in, I woke up
I’ve never seen a pretty girl
Look so tough, baby
You got that look, ah
Color you peach and black
Color me taken aback
Crucial, I think I want you
You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look
Look here
You got the look
You must've took
A whole hour just to make up your face, baby
Closin' time, ugly lights, everybody's inspected
Everybody's inspected
But you are a natural beauty unaffected
Unaffected
Did I say an hour?
My face is red, I stand corrected
I stand corrected
There's no girl to do
Well, here we are
Ladies and gentlemen
Oh, please!
Slammin'!
You walked in
I walked in
I woke up
You woke up
I never seen such a pretty girl look so tough, baby
Baby
You got that look
Yes, you do, yes, you do
If your love is good, let's get to rammin' now
Here we are, folks!
The dream we all dream of!

===== Prince - Take Me with U =====
I can't disguise the pounding of my heart
It beats so strong
It's in your eyes, what can I say?
They turn me on
I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care, pretty baby
Just take me with you
Come on and touch the place in me
That's calling out your name
We want each other, oh-so much
Why must we play this game?
Don't care where we go
I don't care if we spend the night at your mansion
I don't care if we spend the night on the town
All I want is to spend the night together
All I want is to spend the night in your arms
To be around you is so, oh, right
You're sheer perfection (Thank you)
Drive me crazy, drive me all night
Just don't break up the connection
Won't you take me with you?
Honey, take me with you
Whoo, hoo-hoo
Oooooo

===== Prince - Soft and Wet =====
Hey, lover, I got a sugarcane
That I want to lose in you, baby, can you stand the pain?
Hey, lover, sugar, don't you see?
There's so many things that you do to me
Ooh, baby!
(Hey, lover)
All I want to see is the love in your eyes
And all I wanna hear is your sweet love sighs
All I wanna feel is a burning flame
Tell me, tell me, baby, that you feel the same
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Tell me that you love me, girl
If this is lust, then I must confess I feel it every day
If this is wrong, then I long to be as far from right as I may
Soft and wet
Every time I'm with you, you just love me to death
Ooh, wee, baby, you leave me without breath
Oh, baby!
Ooh, yeah
You're just as soft as a lion tamed
You're just as wet as the evening rain
And I really dig it when you call my name
Your love is driving me, you're driving me insane
Crazy, baby, oh, girl
Crazy about your love!
Soft and wet (You know)
You are soft and wet (Oh, sugar)
Your love is soft and wet
Ooh, soft and wet
Ooh, oh

===== Adele - Someone Like You =====
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
I wish nothing but the best for you

===== Adele - Easy On Me =====
There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on mе, baby
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show
I didn't get the chance to

===== Adele - Rolling in the Deep =====
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) I can't help feeling
Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door (Ooh woah, oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Ooh woah, oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all, yeah (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat

===== Adele - Set Fire to the Rain =====
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better
'Cause there's a side to you
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you
Oh
Oh, no
Let it burn

===== Adele - When We Were Young =====
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But, if by chance, you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie, you sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me
You still look like a movie, you still sound like a song
(When we were young)
It's hard to admit that (When we were young)
Everything just takes me back (When we were young)
To when you were there (When we were young)
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on (When we were young)
Just in case it hasn't gone (When we were young)
I guess I still care (When we were young)
Do you still care?
(When we were young, when we were young)
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
When we were young

===== Adele - Make You Feel My Love =====
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you

===== Adele - Send My Love (To Your New Lover) =====
Just the guitar, okay, cool
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me, mmm
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me, mmm
That was what you told me
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
I was too strong, you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (Rising), mmm
Baby, I'm still rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (Down), mmm
There's only one way down
You set me free, oh
If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
No, we ain't kids no more
(Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready?
(Treat her better)

===== Adele - Skyfall =====
This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Face it all together at Skyfall
At Skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart
Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me without the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand
Ooh

===== Adele - Love In The Dark =====
Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never-endin', we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please, stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Everything changed me
You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all, the more that we will fight
Please, don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay
We're not the only ones, I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said, you know I'll always mean
It is the world to me that you are in my life
But I want to live and not just survive
That's why I can't love you in the dark
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me

===== Adele - Chasing Pavements =====
I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
I build myself up and fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it, or?
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Oh-oh

===== Adele - All I Ask =====
I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left?
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do
What lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that mattered
Tell me, who do I run to?
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't want to be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness

===== Adele - Water Under the Bridge =====
If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holdin' me the way you do
Oh, honey, if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?
It's so cold out here (Here, here, here)
In your wilderness (Eh, eh, eh)
I want you to be my keeper (Eh, eh, eh)
But not if you are so reckless
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Woah
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love
It's so cold (Here, here, here)
But not if you are so reckless (Ooh)
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)

===== Adele - Oh My God =====
I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me comin' back even though I'm terrified
I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah
Oh, my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell
Is a battle that I cannot fight
I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Oh, Lord)
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Don't let me let myself down)
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Oh, my God)
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
When it's a battle that I cannot fight
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (I know that it's wrong, but I want to have fun)
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah)

===== Adele - Turning Tables =====
Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Under haunted skies, I see you, ooh
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down
Turning tables
Next time, I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
When the thunder calls for me
Standing on my own two feet
I won't let you close enough to hurt me
Turning tables, yeah
Turn, no, no-oh, mmm

===== Adele - Rumour Has It =====
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you and, boy, she's bringin' you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore
Rumour has it (Rumour)
She is half your age
But I'm guessin' that's the reason that you strayed
I heard you've been missin' me
You've been tellin' people things you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out when she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumours? (Bless your soul)
You made a fool out of me and, boy, you're bringin' me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumour has it, I'm the one you're leaving her for
All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it
Rumour has it (Rumour, rumour)
Rumour has it
But rumour has it, he's the one I'm leaving you for

===== Adele - Don't You Remember =====
When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more
When was the last time that you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me
Why don't you remember?

===== Adele - One And Only =====
You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows
Why it's taken me so long
To let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want
I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine
I dare you to let me be your
Your one and only
Promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can
Walk that mile
Until the end starts
Have I been on your mind?
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name?
Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close?
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go
'Cause I've been here before
I promise I'm worthy, mmm
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
So, I dare you to let me be your
I promise I'm worthy
Come on and give me the chance

===== Adele - I Drink Wine =====
How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down
By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow
When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied
You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')
To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants somethin', you just want me
Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control?
Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?
In these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true
You better believe for you, I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)
High tides (High tides, high tides)
'Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire, oh
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free
Everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me
Listen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time (Hope in time)
We both will find peace of mind (We both find)
Sometimes, the road less travelled is a road best left behind
Well, I hope I learn to get over myself
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free, yeah
'Cause everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me
But the higher we climb, feels like we're both none the wiser
The only regret I have
I wish that it was just at a different time
A most turbulent period of my life
Why would I put that on you?
That's just, like, a very heavy thing to have to talk about
But because of that period of time
Even though it was so much fun
I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him
There was just memories in a big storm

===== Adele - Hometown Glory =====
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you, dear?"
"Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering"
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now
I like it in the city
When the air is so thick and opaque
I love it to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Ooh, the people I've met, yeah
Doo-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah, yeah
Doo-doo-doo-doo ooh-ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah-ey
Of my world
Yeah, of my world
Of my world, yeah

===== Elton John - Cold Heart (PNAU Remix) =====
(Oh)
(You're my cold heart)
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you (Oh)
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid
Oh no, no, no (No, no, no, no, no)
Cold, cold heart (Oh)
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby (Oh)
(And I think it's gonna be a long, long time)
('Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find)
(I'm not the man they think I am at home)
(Oh, no, no, no) (No, no, no, no, no)
Shoorah (Oh)
Shoorah
(No, no, no, no, no)

===== Elton John - I'm Still Standing =====
You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well, look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standin', you just fade away
Don't you know, I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
And I'm still standin' after all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now
You know, I'm still standin' better than I ever did
Don't you know that I'm still standin' better than I ever did?

===== Elton John - Rocket Man (I Think It's Going To Be A Long, Long Time) =====
She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour 9 a.m.​​
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man burnin' out his fuse up here alone
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if ya did
And all the science, I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man

===== Elton John - Your Song =====
It's a little bit funny
This feelin' inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh
But then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travellin' show, oh
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody
This is your song
It may be quite simple, but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
I sat on the roof
And kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses
Well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgettin'
But these things I do
You see, I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
This is the song

===== Elton John - Don't Go Breaking My Heart =====
Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Oh, honey, if I get restless
Baby, you're not that kind
You take the weight off of me
Oh, honey, when you knocked on my door
Ooh, I gave you my key
Ooh, nobody knows it
When I was down, I was your clown
Ooh, nobody knows it (Nobody knows it)
Right from the start, I gave you my heart
Oh, I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
And now it's up to us, babe
Oh, I think we can make it
So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh, you put the spark to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights
Don't go breaking my, don't go breaking my
Don't go breaking my heart (Don't go breaking my)
I won't go breaking your heart…

===== Elton John - Tiny Dancer =====
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady
Seamstress for the band
Pretty-eyed, pirate smile
You'll marry a music man
Ballerina, you must've seen her
Dancing in the sand
And now she's in me, always with me
Tiny dancer in my hand
Jesus freaks out in the street
Handing tickets out for God
Turning back, she just laughs
The boulevard is not that bad
Piano man, he makes his stand
In the auditorium
Looking on, she sings the songs
The words she knows, the tune she hums
But, oh, how it feels so real
Lying here with no one near
Only you, and you can hear me
When I say softly, slowly
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Oh, how it feels so real
Ooh

===== Elton John - Bennie And The Jets =====
Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hittin' somethin'
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around
You're gonna hear electric music, solid walls of sound
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Ooh, but they're so spaced out
B-B-B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know, I read it in a magazine, oh-oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded, but Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong
Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet?
Oh, but they're so spaced out
Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets, the Jets, the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets

===== Elton John - Goodbye Yellow Brick Road =====
When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singin' the blues
Ah, ah-ah ah ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm goin' back to my plough
Back to the howlin' old owl in the woods
Huntin' the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
What do you think you'll do, then?
I bet they shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffin' for tidbits like you on the ground

===== Elton John - Hold Me Closer =====
(Hold me closer)
I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands (Oh)
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today, oh
Hold me closer
Hold me closer (Hold me closer)
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels, baby (Yeah)
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
Count the headlights on the highway (Yeah)
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer (Baby, baby)
Hold me closer (Oh, yeah)
(Hold me closer) Hold me closer
(Hold me closer) Me closer, me closer
(Hold me closer) Mm, yeah

===== Elton John - Sacrifice =====
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes callin'
And negativity lands
Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts livin'
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all
Mutual misunderstandin'
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns
No sacrifice at all

===== Elton John - Can You Feel The Love Tonight =====
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you
And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
There's a time for everyone, if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

===== Elton John - Step Into Christmas =====
Welcome to my Christmas song
I'd like to thank you for the year
So I'm-a sendin' you this Christmas card
To say, "It's nice to have you here"
I'd like to sing about all the things
Your eyes and mind can see
So hop aboard your turntable
Oh, step into Christmas with me, yeah
Step into Christmas, let's join together
We can watch the snow fall forever and ever
Eat, drink and be merry, come along with me
Step into Christmas, the admission's free
Take care in all you do next year
And keep smilin' through the days
If we can help to entertain you
Oh, we will find the ways
So merry Christmas, one and all
There's no place I'd rather be
Than askin' you if you'd oblige
Steppin' into Christmas with me
Step into Christmas, the admission's free, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
(La-la-la, lalalalala-la-la-la)
Welcome to my Christmas song (La-la-la)
So I'm sendin' you this Christmas card (La-la-la)
I'd like to sing about all the things (La-la-la)
So hop aboard the turntable
(Step, step into Christmas
Ah, forever and ever
Yeah, come along with me, ah)
Oh

===== Elton John - Crocodile Rock =====
I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
Well, Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight
Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

===== Elton John - I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues =====
Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say
That things can only get better
And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughin' like children, livin' like lovers
Rollin' like thunder under the covers
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man
Wait on me, girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself
(Laughing like children, living like lovers)

===== Elton John - Candle In The Wind =====
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

===== Elton John - Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me =====
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light
Don't let the sun go down on me (Don't let the sun)
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life (Don't let the sun) to wander free
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal
I'd just allow a fragment of your life (Don't let the sun) to wander free, yeah

===== Elton John - Nikita =====
Hey Nikita, is it cold
In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart, a captive in the snow
Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know
Do you ever dream of me?
And do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita, do you count the stars at night?
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend
Never know anythin' about my home
(Nikita) Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row

===== Elton John - Daniel =====
Daniel is travelin' tonight on a plane
I can see the red taillights headin' for Spain
Oh, and I can see Daniel wavin' goodbye
God, it looks like Daniel
Must be the clouds in my eyes
They say Spain is pretty, though I've never been
And Daniel says it's the best place he's ever seen
Oh, and he should know, he's been there enough
Lord, I miss Daniel
Oh, I miss him so much
Oh, Daniel, my brother, you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died, but you see more than I
Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky
Oh God, it looks like Daniel

===== Elton John - Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting) =====
It's getting late, have you seen my mates?
Ma, tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock
Wanna get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady, she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair
Oh, don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Oh, Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright, ooh
Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out, "She's with me"
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass
Saturday night's alright for fighting
'Cause Saturday night's alright for fighting
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright, whoo

===== Elton John - Are You Ready For Love? =====
Catch a star if you can
Wish for somethin' special
Let it be me, my love is free
Sing a song to yourself
Think of someone listenin'
One melody, you're all for me
I'll write a symphony just for you and me
If you let me love you
I'll paint a masterpiece just for you to see
If you let me love you, let me love you
Are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am, are you
(Ooh, ooh, baby)
You're the one like the sun
Shine your love around me
You'll always be the one for me
Say the word, I'll be there
Lovin' you forever
Don't let me go, just say it's so
We'll hear the music ring from the mountaintops
To the valley below us
We'll serenade the world with a lullaby
So the angels will know us, angels will know us
Love
Oh, are you ready, are you ready for love?
Yes I am
Are you ready, yes I'm ready for love
Are, are, are, are, are, are you ready for love?
Are you, are you, are you ready for love?

===== Bruno Mars - Just the Way You Are =====
Oh
Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful, uh
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Yeah
Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
You know I'll say
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing

===== Bruno Mars - When I Was Your Man =====
Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that
I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
'Cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man

===== Bruno Mars - Talking to the Moon =====
I know you're somewhere out there, somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy, but they don't understand
You're all I had, you're all I had
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talkin' to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talkin' to me, too
Or am I a fool who sits alone
Talkin' to the moon?
Oh

They say I've gone mad, yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know, 'cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talkin' back, yeah, they're talkin' back, oh

===== Bruno Mars - Grenade =====
Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?
Gave you all I had, and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah), oh, oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
No, no, no, no
Uh
Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face, then rip the brakes out my car
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
(Uh) But darlin', I'd still catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Ooh, you'd never do the same

Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, why can't you see
Slow it down, read the sign
So you know just where you're going
Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with a human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
Do do-do do, do do-do do
Do do-do, always be together
Ba da-ba ba, ba da-ba ba
Ba da-ba, stay that way forever
Take or leave it cause we've always got each other
You know who you are and yes, you're gonna breakdown
You've crossed the line so you're gonna have to turn around
Don't you know, what can't you see
Gotta keep it down honey, lay your back on the line
'Cause I don't care about the money, don't be wasting my time

Tell me, will this déjà vu never end? Oh

Is a promise you will be there
Say you will be there
Ow, say you will be there
Oh, won't you sing it with me?
If you put two and two together

And (And) all that I want from you (All I want from you)
Is a promise you (Is a promise you) will be there
Yeah, I want you
Any fool can see they're falling
I'll give you everything, on this I swear
Just promise you'll always be there
I'm giving you everything (I'm giving you everything)
And all that I want from you (All that I want from you)
Is a promise you (Want you to promise to)
Will be there (Always be there)

===== Spice Girls - Spice Up Your Life =====
La-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la-la
When you're feeling sad and low
We will take you where you gotta go
Smiling, dancing, everything is free
All you need is positivity
Colours of the world (Spice up your life)
Every boy and every girl (Spice up your life)
People of the world (Spice up your life, ah)
Slam it to the left (If you're havin' a good time)
Shake it to the right (If you know that you feel fine)
Chicas to the front (Ha, ha)
And go 'round
Hai, sí, ja! Hold tight!
Yellow man in Timbuktu
Colourful, both me and you
Kung Fu fighting, dancing queen
Tribal spaceman and all that's in between
Flamenco, lambada
But hip hop is harder
We moonwalk the foxtrot
*Then polka, the salsa*
(Shake it, shake it, shake it, haka)
Arriba! (*Ariba!*)
*Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha*

===== Spice Girls - Who Do You Think You Are =====
The race is on to get out of the bottom
The top is high so your roots are forgotten
Giving is good, as long as you're getting
What's driving you is ambition I'm betting
(I said-a) Who do you think you are?
(Do you think you are?) oh, oh, oh
(I said-a) Who, some kind of superstar?
(You have got to) oh, oh, oh
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it, who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show me how good you are
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it, show how good you are
You're swelling out in the wrong direction
You've got the bug, superstar you've been bitten
Your trumpet's blowing for far too long
Climbing the snake up the ladder, but you're wrong
You have got to reach on up, never lose your soul
You have got to reach on up, never lose control
(Swing it, shake it, move it, make it)
(Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it)

===== Spice Girls - Viva Forever =====
Do you still remember
How we used to be?
Feeling together, believing whatever
My love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers
Young love in the sun
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave ya
We'd only just begun
Hasta mañana
Always be mine
Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever for the moment
Ever searching for the one
Yes, I still remember
Every whispered word
The touch of your skin, giving life from within
Like a love song never heard
Slipping through our fingers
Like the sands of time
Promises made, every memory saved
As reflections in my mind
Always be mine (Always be mine)
Back where I belong now
Was it just a dream?
Feelings unfold, they will never be sold
And the secret's safe with me
Viva forever (Viva forever), I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
Everlasting (Everlasting) like the sun (Like the sun)
Live forever (Live forever) for the moment (For the moment)
Ever searching (Ever searching) for the one (For the one)
Viva forever (Viva forever), I'll be waiting
Live forever (Live forever) for the moment
Viva forever, I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)

===== Spice Girls - Mama =====
She used to be my only enemy and never let me be free
Catching me in places that I knew I shouldn't be
Every other day I crossed the line, I didn't mean to be so bad
I never thought you would become the friend I never had
Back then I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood (Mama)
So now I see through your eyes
All that you did was love
Mama I love you, Mama I care
Mama I love you, Mama my friend
You're my friend
I didn't want to hear it then, but I'm not ashamed to say it now
Every little thing you said and did was right for me
I've had a lot of time to think about, about the way I used to be
Never had a sense of my responsibility
Why you were misunderstood
But now I'm sure I know why (I know why)
So now I see through your eyes (See through your eyes)
All that you did was love (All I can give you is love)
Me loving you, you loving me
A love that's true, and guaranteed
Me loving you (Me loving you)
You loving me (You loving me)
A love that's true (A love that's true)
And guaranteed (So true)

===== Spice Girls - Too Much =====
Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep but meaningless words to me
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end
Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me (pleases me)
But short term solution ain't no resolution
That ain't no release for me
Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied
Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
Something fine built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast
Yes my dear you know he soothes me (Moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me
Too much of something is bad enough (Bad enough)
Too much of nothing is just as tough (Just as tough)
What part of no don't you understand
(Understand, understand)
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can
Boy who thinks he can
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie

===== Spice Girls - Goodbye =====
No, no, no, no
Listen, little child, there will come a day
When you will be able, able to say
Never mind the pain or the aggravation
You know there's a better way for you and me to be
Look for the rainbow in every storm
Fly like an angel heaven sent to me
Goodbye, my friend
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone
But I can still feel you here)
It's not the end
(I gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it
Time will never change it, no, no, no
(No, no, no, no)
Just a little girl, big imagination
Never letting no one take it away
Went into the world (into the world), what a revelation
She found there's a better way for you and me to be
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby
You know it's time to say goodbye
The times when we would play about
The way we used to scream and shout
We never dreamt you'd go your own sweet way
Time will never, never ever change it
(No, no, no, no) You know it's time to say goodbye
(No, no, no, no) And don't forget you can rely
And don't forget, on me you can rely
(No, no, no, no) I will help, help you on your way
I will be with you every day
(No, no, no, no) I will be with you every day

===== Spice Girls - Never Give Up On The Good Times =====
She used to be a chancer, sparkle in the rain
Told me she needed a friend
Is she going crazy? Baby's on the way
Seems like the day never ends
Everybody needs some affection (Ah-ah-ah)
Never shy (Never shy)
Gotta try (Gotta try)
Wherever you're going
Never give up on the good times, gotta believe in the love you find
(Never give it up no, never give it up no)
Never give up on the good times, livin' it up is a state of mind
Bossa nova baby, heart is never soul
Shouting but he's never heard
Eyes all wide and open, the streets are paved with gold
Someone's come back on their word
Down and dirty city, feeling outta place
Maybe you've ran out of time
He treats her like a lady, smile upon her face
Make up the last of the lines
Everybody needs some attention (Ah-ah-ah)
(Never give it up)
(Believe in the love that you find)
Hey now, look around, pick yourself up off the ground
I said hey now look around pick yourself up off the ground (Never give up)
I said hey now look around pick yourself up off the ground
I said, hey (Never give up)
I said never give up on the good times, gotta believe in the love you find

===== Spice Girls - Christmas Wrapping =====
"Bah! Humbug" - no, that's too strong
'Cause it's my favorite holiday
But all this year's been a busy blur
Don't think I have the energy
To add to my already mad rush
Just because it is the season
The perfect gift for me would be
Completions and connections left from
Last year, world tour, aeroplanes and babies
Met some guys but never the time
Most of '98 passed along those lines
So deck the halls and trim those trees
Raise up the cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas with my mates this year
Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chilled this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens, sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!
Flashback to springtime, saw him again
Would've been good to go for a lunch
Couldn't agree we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
We didn't, of course, 'til the summertime
Out to the beach to his boat, could I join him?
No, this time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendar's just one page
And, of course, I am excited
Tonight's the night, but I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it
All:
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
But I think I'll miss this one this year
Emma:
Hardly dashing through the snow
'Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-do's
A few cards, a few calls
Because it's R-S-V-P
No thanks, no party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turned down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way, unwind
Doing Christmas right this time
Tesco has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn, guess what I forgot?
So it's on with the boots, back out in the snow
To the only all-night garage
But when to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line that guy I've been chasing all year
"Spending this one alone," he said
"Need a break; this year's been crazy."
I said, "Me too, but why are you?
You mean you forgot the papers too?"
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending
(Repeat to Fade)

===== Spice Girls - Saturday Night Divas =====
Get down, get deeper and down
Saturday night
Get, down, deeper and down

I'm not alone, no you're not in my mind
You were the victim of your crime, I left you behind
Boy you were a fool, to treat me that way
Not gonna let you, I'm gonna forget you, there's nothing to say
You're a twisted lover, kiss and telling on a superstar
That's what you are
But it was Saturday night, I know the feeling was right

Take it from me, you know I mean what I'm saying

Your precious words and promises ain't bringin' me down
I've got some living to do (Got some living to do)
But don't assume I'm gonna be with you
Stop pushin', you're rushin'
You're losing my lovin'
I hope it, I see it
Just play it, you feel it
Gotta be bold, bold and oh-so strong
Get with this and you got it goin' on
On and on with the girls named Spice

God help the mister, yeah, God help the mister
That comes between me and my sisters

===== Spice Girls - If U Can't Dance =====
If you can't dance, if you can't dance
If you can't dance to this, you can't do nothing for me, baby
Now we got the flavour, the bad behaviour
The rhythm, the melody, the juice for you to savour
We're rockin' and vibin' but somebody is jivin'
You need to take a tip, sort it out, get a grip
Whenever I go out, wherever it may be
Never is there a Keanu, but a dweeb lookin' at me
But then even if I do score, he's a loser in the dance floor
Take a deep breath count one, two, three
Even when his eyes met mine
His slamming moves were out of time
Can't you just feel the groove? (feel the groove)
Why don't you move?
It's easy, can't you see? (can't you see?)
Take my hands and dance with me (dance with me)
Hey macho, te vi el otro día
Me dio mucha, mucha alegría
Escucha la música, ¡ay, madre mía!
Hey, chico, tú no tienes nada
Qué susto, qué sueco, qué polla, qué tieso
Oh, no me toques, ¡ay, qué pero, feo!
Venga, venga, marcha salida
Toma esa música, me cantas deprisa
Cuidado, cuidado, qué chico, qué loco
Toma mi ritmo, me voy contigo
Hey, macho, te quiero, quiero un hombre, necesito, sí
Pero no tú, un hombre, hey, macho
Hey, macho, si no bailas esto no puedes nada conmigo
Can't do nothing for me, baby (Oh-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa)
Nothing, baby (Oh-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa-oh whoa)

===== Spice Girls - Last Time Lover =====
Treat me right, all night
Makes me feel good, like you should
Listen up, I gotta tell ya
About the ins and outs and goings-on
I wouldn't tell just anybody
About the fox that I've been chasing
He's resistant, I'm persistent
He didn't stop me from honing in
'Cause I'm a choosy not a floozy
I get my hit and then I run with it
Last time lover (Lover)
Do you think I'm really cool and sexy?
And I know you wanna get with me
Do you wanna be my last time, baby?
Could it be your first time maybe?

I got my major chords strumming
Took some time and then we're really buzzing
First bite whet my appetite (Mmm)
Second helping's always better (Ah)
Started gettin' burning hot
I found my pride not easy
Slowed it down, I said stop
Last time lover (Treat me right)
Lovin' undercover (All night)

===== Spice Girls - Do It =====
Oh yeah, come on
Come on and do it (Yeah)
Come on and do it (Do it, do it)
It's just another thing, you gotta keep your eye fixed on the road
Do what your mama said, I will not be told
Keep your mouth shut, keep your legs shut, get back in your place
Ha, blameless, shameless, damsel in disgrace
Who cares what they say
Because the rules are for breaking
(I said-a) Who made them anyway?
You've gotta show what you feel, don't hide
Come on and do it
Don't care how you look, it's just how you feel
You've gotta make it real
It's time to free what's in your soul
You've got to get it right, this time
Come on, freak and lose control
Remember things like you should be seen and never heard
Give a little respect to me and it will be returned
Keep your head down, keep your nose clean, your back against the wall
Girl there's no way out for you, you are sure to fall
Who cares what they do
Because it's yours for the taking
So, it's not for you anyway
Make your own rules to live by
You might do the wrong thing (Might do the wrong thing)
For the right reasons (For the right reasons)
Don't just do the right thing (Don't do the right thing)

===== Selena Gomez - Wolves =====
In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love, and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night (Ah)
Drunk on a feelin', alone with the stars in the sky
I've been runnin' through the jungle
I've been runnin' with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been cryin' with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, to get to you
Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly, I am following
Break down these walls and come on in

===== Selena Gomez - Lose You To Love Me =====
You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus
'Cause it wasn't yours
I saw the signs and I ignored it
Rose-colored glasses all distorted
Set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn
You got off on the hurtin'
When it wasn't yours, yeah
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
I gave my all and they all know it
Then you tore me down and now it's showing
In two months, you replaced us
Like it was easy
Made me think I deserved it
In the thick of healing, yeah
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
Sang off-key in my chorus
And now the chapter is closed and done
And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us

===== Selena Gomez - Back To You =====
Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with the cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you (Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it even though I do (Even though I do)
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I’d go back to you
I know I’d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you
We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me ('Cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (Isn't what it could be)
I know it's forward, but it's true (Oh, oh)
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it (Ah, ah)
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
You can break my heart in two
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to (When I'm not supposed to)
When I'm lyin' close to someone else (Ah, ah)
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it (Oh, oh)
I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you, I'll go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you (I'll go back to you)
I'll go back to you (I'll go back to you, ooh)
Ooh, ooh-ooh

===== Selena Gomez - Good For You =====
I'm on my 14 carats
I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you
I'm on my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad
I won't, I won't
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I
Hold on, take a minute, love
Cause I ain't trying to fuck your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to fuck your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, fuck the signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next bitch
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad bitch without the ass shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you

===== Selena Gomez - Hands To Myself =====
Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice
So come on, give me a taste
Of what it's like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice (Oh)
'Cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
All of the downs and the uppers
And I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, but I
My hands to myself
The doctors say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day, oh (Oh)
I want it all, no, nothing else
Give me your all and nothing else
Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all
I want it all (Ooh)
I mean, I could, but why would I want to?
My hands to myself (Oh)
My hands to myself (Can't keep, keep my)
Give me your all and nothing else (Oh)

===== Selena Gomez - Same Old Love =====
Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now-ow
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
I'm not spending any time
Wasting tonight on you, I know
I've heard it all, so don't you try and change your mind
'Cause I won't be changing too, you know
You can't believe, still can't believe it
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love

===== Selena Gomez - Fetish =====
Take it or leave it
Baby, take it or leave it
But I know you won't leave it
'Cause I know that you need it (Uh)
Look in the mirror
When I look in the mirror
Baby, I see it clearer
Why you wanna be nearer (Uh)
I'm not surprised
I sympathize (Ah)
I can't deny
Your appetite (Ah)
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blamin' you
If I were you, I'd do me too
Reachin' your limit
Say you're reachin' your limit
Goin' over your limit
But I know you can't quit it (Uh)
Somethin' about me
Got you hooked on my body
Take you over and under and twisted up like origami (Uh)
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too (It's Gucci)
The way you walk, the way you talk
I blame you 'cause it's all your fault
You're playin' hard, don't turn me off
You actin' hard, but I know you soft
You my fetish, I'm so with it
All these rumors bein' spreaded
Might as well go 'head and whip it
'Cause they sayin' we already did it
Call on Gucci if you ever need me
I'll be South Beach in the drop top gleamin'
Water diamonds, Aquafina
Just need you in a blue bikini

===== Selena Gomez - The Heart Wants What It Wants =====
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants

===== Selena Gomez - Kill Em With Kindness =====
The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it, yeah
We don’t have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now
We’re running out of time
Chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
Always somebody
You’re willing to fight, to be right
Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting
Go ahead, go ahead now
No war in anger

===== Selena Gomez - Bad Liar =====
I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh, wait, that's someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room, there's a king-size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want, you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
Ooh, you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh, every time I watch you serpentine
Oh, I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh, tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to think about you
No, no, no, no, not to think about you
Oh, no, no, no, no
I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no, not to give in to you (Oh)
With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar
I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear, oh-oh
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush
Ooh, you're taking up a fraction of my mind (Of my mind)
Not to think about you (Not to think about you)
No, no, no, no, not to think about you (Not to think about you)
Not to give in to you (Not to give in to you)
No, no, no, no, not to give in to you (Not to give in to you, oh)
And oh, baby, let's make reality actuality, a reality
Oh, baby, let's make reality actuality, a reality (Oh)
Not to think about you (Think about you)
No, no, no, no, not to think about you (Think about you)

===== Selena Gomez - People You Know =====
You were runnin' through me like water
Now the feeling's leavin' me dry
These days, we couldn't be farther
So how’s it feel to be on the other side?
So many wasted (Wasted)
Nights with (Nights with) you (You)
I still can taste it (Taste it)
I hate it, wish I could take it back 'cause
We used to be close, but people can go
From people you know to people you don't
And what hurts the most is people can go
When it was good, we were on fire
Now I'm breathin' ashes and dust
I always wanna get higher
I never know when enough is enough
Dum-dum-dum, da-da-dum-dum-dum
Da-da-dum-dum, da-da-da-dum
People you don't
People you don't (Ooh)
From people you know to people you don't (Ooh)
Dum-dum-dum, da-da-dum-dum-dum (Ooh)
Da-da-dum-dum, da-da-dum

===== Selena Gomez - Look At Her Now =====
Yeah
They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny 'til it wasn't
Feels good 'til it doesn't
It was her first real lover
His too 'til he had another
Oh, God, when she found out
Trust levels went way down
Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet (Mm)
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Wow, look at her now
Fast nights that got him
That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment
Like that night
Wasn't wrong, wasn't right, yeah
What a thing to be human (What a thing to be human)
Made her more of a woman (Made her more of a woman)
Wow, look at her now (Look at her now)
(Ah)

She knows she'll find love (She knows)
Only if she wants it
On the up from the way down
Mm-mm, look at her now, mm-mm (Oh)
She knows she'll find love (She knows she will)
She knows she'll find love
Look at her now, yeah (Look at her now)

You've been so distant from me lately
And lately
Don’t even wanna call you "baby"

===== Selena Gomez - Single Soon =====
Should I do it on the phone?
Should I leave a little note
In the pocket of his coat? Yeah
Maybe I'll just disappear
I don't wanna see a tear
And the weekend's almost here
I'm pickin' out this dress
Tryin' on these shoes
'Cause I'll be single soon
I'll be single soon
I know he'll be a mess
When I break the news
But I'll be single soon
I'ma date who I wanna
Stay out late if I wanna
I'ma do what I wanna do
'Causе I'll be single soon
I'll be singlе soon
I know I'm a little high
Maintenance, but I'm worth a try
Might not give a reason why (Oh well)
We both had a lot of fun
Time to find another one
Blame it all on feelin' young
Yeah, I'll be single soon (Hah-ah)
Yeah, I'll be single soon
Well, who's next?

===== Selena Gomez - Slow Down =====
Now that I have captured your attention
I wanna steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA, I'm ready for inspection
Sh-sh-show me how you make a first impression
Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
'Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
'Til you can't let me go (Ah)
I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
(Slow, slow) Yeah, baby, slow down the song
If you want me, I'm accepting applications
So long as we can keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazin'

The music's got me going
No stopping 'til the morning
You know I'm ready for it, for it, for it, yeah

How do I do it?
It-It-It's The Cataracs
Ha ha ha ha

===== Selena Gomez - Feel Me =====
No one love you like I love ya
Never cheat, never lie
Never put no one above ya
I gave you space and time
Now you're telling me you miss it
And I'm still on your mind
We were one in a million
And love is hard to find
Do you stay up late
Just so you don't dream?
Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
Do your days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh (Do you feel me?)
Days get a little bit longer? (Feel me)
Nights get a little bit colder? (Feel me)
Oh
When you're running, who you run to?
Where do you go to hide?
When she ain't giving you enough to
Get you through the night
Won't be caught up in the middle
Of your highs and your lows
Baby, long as you're not with me
You'll always be alone
Do you feel me? (Feel me)
Feel me (Oh, feel me)
Feel me (Feel me)

===== Selena Gomez - My Mind & Me =====
Wanna hear a part to my story? I tried to hide in the glory
And sweep it under the table so you would never know
Sometimes I feel like an accident, people look when they're passin' it
Never check on the passenger, they just want the free show
Yeah, I'm constantly
Tryna fight somethin' that my eyes can't see
My mind and me
We don't get along sometimes
And it gets hard to breathe
But I wouldn't change my life
And all of the crashin' and burnin' and breakin', I know now
If somеbody sees me like this, then thеy won't feel alone now
It's hard to talk and feel heard when you always feel like a burden
Don't wanna add to concern I know they already got
But if I pull back the curtain, then maybe someone who's hurtin'
Will be a little more certain they're not the only one lost
If somebody sees me like this, then they won't feel alone now
My mind and me (Ah, ah, ah)
My mind, my mind
Oh, it's only my mind and me

===== Selena Gomez - Boyfriend =====
I want a boyfriend
But I just keep hitting dead ends
Try to take a shortcut, but I get cut again and again
Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones, but I want love again and again
I been up all night
Pretty restlessly
Think I might know why (Ah)
I've been doing just fine
But baby, that don't mean
That I'm feeling anti you and me
There's a difference between a want and a need
Some nights, I just want more than me
I know that there's a fine line between
It's not what I need, but (Yeah)
Try to take a shortcut, but I get cut again and again (Yeah)
I want a boyfriend (Uh-huh)
Tell me, are there any good ones left?
I keep finding wrong ones, but I want love again and again (Yeah)
I could phone a friend, use a hotline or something
But that won't get the job done (Uh-uh)
'Cause every time I try (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Every time they lie (Uh, ooh-hoo)

===== Selena Gomez - Me & The Rhythm =====
Ooh, the rhythm takes you over
Takes you to a different place
A different space
Ooh, the smoke is getting closer
I can feel our young blood race
Through cityscapes
And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much
Yeah, all I need
Is the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah, the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Ooh, I start to feel it now
Feeling like I'm truly free
I'm free in me
Ooh, the heat's a common ground
No matter what's your history
Be free with me, oh
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark

There are times when I look above and beyond
There are times when I feel your love around me, baby
I'll never forget my baby
I'll never forget you
When I feel that I don't belong
Draw my strength from the words when you said
Hey, it's about you, baby
Look deeper inside you, baby
Dream about us together again
What I want: us together again, baby
I know we'll be together again, 'cause

===== Janet Jackson - Got 'Til It's Gone =====
What's, what's the next song?
The one about me
Oh, yeah, I like this one
Uh, uh, like Joni says
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Have a feeling, now believing that you
Were the one I was meant to be with
Oh how I'm wishing, thinking, dreaming 'bout you, and the love
How'd I ever let you get away?
Don't it always seem
Joni Mitchell never lies
If I could turn back the hands of time
Make you fall in love, in love with me again
So would you give me another chance to love
To love you, love you the right way, no games
Got 'til it's gone
That you don't know what you've got 'til
One-two, one-two, yo
Let me just fuck with it for a minute, what
(That you don't what you've got til it's gone)
Now you realizing when them nights go long, right?
Campaign for me to stay when you know that I'm gone, right?
You act all wild, when I tell you to settle
I was working round the clock, but your girls want to meddle
Talk about I heard he swims with this chick on the beach
That was out with the tide but my love you impeach
Now you looking at the walls, head in hands, cold jonesin'
Ringing my house, hanging up and imposing
And why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that, huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that love, huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that and do that huh?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Yo, do you feel that?
You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Dust

===== Janet Jackson - Any Time, Any Place =====
In the thundering rain
You stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand
Moving up my thighs
Skirt around my waist
Wall against my face
I can feel your lips, ooh
I don't wanna stop just because
People walking by are watching us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now
You feel so good inside of my love
And I'm not gonna stop no, no, no
I want you
All I wanna say is
Any time
And any place
I don't care who's around
Mm
Ooh, any time
No, no, no, no, no
Dancing on the floor
Feeling the slow groove
My mind is starting to burn
With forbidden thoughts
Strangers all around
With the lights down low
I was thinking maybe we could
Well, you know
I don't wanna stop just because (I don't wanna stop, baby)
People standing around are watching us (Standing 'round are watching us)
I don't give a damn what they think (I don't give a damn)
I want you now (I want you now)
I don't wanna stop just because (I don't wanna stop)
You feel so good inside of my love (Inside of my love)
I'm not gonna stop no, no, no (No, no, no)
I want you (I want you now)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Any time, baby
I don't care who's around (Say it again, say it, oh yeah)
Any time (Any time)
Baby, baby
Any place, sugar
They can watch, they can stare, I don't care, ooh-ooh-ooh

===== Janet Jackson - Again =====
I heard from a friend today
And she said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back to me in my
Mind
"How can I be strong?" I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again
A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions, you had many
I know you did
I've come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
Never fall again
Making love to you
Ooh, it felt so good and
Ooh, so right
So here we are alone again
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss
I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
I don't think I can take the pain
Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love me then leave again
'Cause I'm falling in love with
You again
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do
Love you
Again

===== Janet Jackson - I Get Lonely =====
I get so lonely, can't let just anybody hold me
You are the one that lives in me, my dear
I want no one but you
I want no one but...
Sittin' here with my tears
All alone with my fears, I'm wondering
If I have to do without you
But there's no reason why
I fell asleep late last night
Cryin' like a newborn child
Holdin' myself close
Pretendin' my arms are yours
I still remember to the day
In fact it was a third Monday
You came along to be the one for me
And now I'm alone
I'm sittin' here by the phone
Call and say that you're okay
So that I have
The chance to beg you to stay
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
You know that I know that I get so lonely thinking of you
Want no one but you

===== Janet Jackson - Escapade =====
As I was walkin' by, saw you standin' there with a smile
Lookin' shy you caught my eye
Thought you'd want to hang for a while
Well, I'd like to be with you
And you know it's Friday, too
I hope you can find the time this weekend

===== Janet Jackson - Let's Wait Awhile =====
There's something I want to tell you
There's something I think that you should know
It's not that I shouldn't really love you
Let's take it slow
When we get to know each other
And we're both feeling much stronger
Then let's try to talk it over
Let's wait awhile longer
Let's wait awhile
Before it's too late
Before we go too far
Remember that special night?
When all of the stars were shining bright
We made our first endeavor
To stay together
We made our very first promise
To love, to share
And be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn't quite right
Our love will be great
I didn't really know not to let all my feelings show
To save some for later so our love can be greater
You said you would always love me
Remember I said the same thing too
You don't have to be frightened with my love
Because I'll never give up on you
You know you can't rush love
Love
Let's wait awhile (Ooh, ooh)
Let's wait awhile (Wait awhile)
Before we go too far (Far, far, oh)
Let's wait awhile (Let's just take our time)
Let's wait awhile (Love's so good)
Sure our love will be there
Let's wait awhile (Slow it down)
I promise
I'll be worth the wait

===== Janet Jackson - If =====
Sittin' over here, starin' in your face
With lust in my eyes, sure don't give a damn
And ya don't know that I've been dreamin'
Of ya in my fantasy
Never once you looked at me
Don't even realize that I'm wantin' you to fulfill my needs
Think what you want, let your mind free
Run free to a place no one dares to
How many nights I've laid in bed excited over you?
I've closed my eyes and thought of us a hundred different ways
I've gotten there so many times, I wonder how 'bout you
Day and night, night and day, all I've got to say is
If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl
Allow me some time to play with your mind
And you'll get there again and again
Close your eyes and imagine my body undressed
Take your time 'cause we've got all night, ooh
You on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs
And let me know what you like, if you like, I'll go
Down, da-down, down, down, da-down, down
I'll hold you in my hand and maybe
Your smooth and shiny feels so good against my lips, sugar
I want you so bad I can taste your love right now, baby
I've laid in bed excited over you
One hundred different ways
I've thought of many, many
All I want to say is
But I'm not

===== Janet Jackson - Miss You Much =====
Shot like an arrow going through my heart
That's the pain I feel
I feel whenever we're apart
Not to say that I'm in love with you
But who's to say that I'm not
I just know that it feels wrong
When I'm away too long
It makes my body hot
So let me tell ya baby
I'll tell your mama
I'll tell your friends
I'll tell anyone whose heart can comprehend
Send it in a letter baby
Tell you on the phone
I'm not the kinda girl
Who likes to be alone
I miss ya much
Boy-oh-I miss you much
I really miss you much
M-I-S-S you much
Baby, I really miss you much
I'm rushing home
Just as soon as I can
I'm rushing home to see
Your smiling face
And feel your warm embrace
It makes f-feel so g-g-g good
So I'll tell you baby
Miss you much
I miss you much
I really really miss you much
I'm not ashamed to tell the world
I miss you
That's the end?

All it is is love from the booth
(Missy!)
Now this your jam, now do your dance

(Let 'em burn)

===== Janet Jackson - Someone To Call My Lover =====
Back on the road again, feeling kinda lonely
And looking for the right guy who'd be mine
Friends say I'm crazy 'cause easily I fall in love
"You gotta do it different, J, this time"
Maybe we'll meet at a bar
He'll drive a funky car
Maybe we'll meet at a club
And fall so deeply in love
He'll tell me I'm the one
And we'll have so much fun
I'll be the girl of his dreams, maybe
Alright, maybe gonna find him today
I gotta get someone to call my lover
Yeah, baby, come on
Alright, baby, come and pass my way
I spoil them when I'm in love
Givin' them what they dream of
Sometimes it's not a good thing but I'm blind
I love hard with everything
Givin' my all more than they
I'll take my friends' advice this time
I'll do it differently
My, my, looking for a guy, guy
I don't want him too shy
But he's gotta have the qualities
That I like in a man
Strong, smart, affectionate
He's gotta be all for me
And I'll be too, you see happily
I'll be the girl of his dreams maybe

===== Janet Jackson - No Sleeep =====
Plush...
Come on
You’re missing me, I’m missing you
Whenever we meet, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
When I get to be together with you
It’s fait accompli, we ain’t gonna get no sleep
A vision rolling round in my head, but I don’t really talk about it
I’m loving what you’re doing to me
And I don’t wanna do without it
Day and night, I dream of us doing whatever
But I guess I’ll have to wait until that day comes
Forty-eight hours of love, it's gonna be a weekend marathon
So you better get ready, my king
'Cause I'ma be the queen of insomnia
Stay wide awake for every moment we spend together
'Cause every second you’re away feels like forever
Don’t have time to sleep, but we can dream
So think outside the box, my baby
Show me how much you were missing me
I’ll read between the lines and I sure hope it rains
Cole world (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (Turn the overall volume up a lil bit, up a lil bit)
How's that? (Yeah, that’s nice)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep (Need time, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
We ain’t gonna get no sleep
I go my way, you go yours
You taste real life, I taste tours (alright)
Sweet at first, but after a while
Too much sugar, they say, is bad for your smile
And I wear a frown now, 'cause I miss real
I miss a warm house, and home cooked meals
And you miss junk food, that’s why we work
You bring cooked food and I bring dessert
Uh, and meet up at the place that we always do
The one swimming through my mind, that was always you
Our time together has inspired a song or two
Or three, or four, or more, mi amor
I’m sure, either you’re the one or I’m caught in the matrix
Staying up for hours while we talk and get wasted
Not from weed smoke, or this cheap wine
Drunk off love we both feel deep down
But too scared to say cause we know how this ends
Thinking, maybe we’d be better off friends with benefits
For the moment this adrenaline, got me feeling like a kid again
Butterflies like MJ, had to fit it in
My schedule, check the bezel, gotta escape by six
Damn, how’d it get so late so quick?
The sun rising (already?) until the next time
I love diving in your mind and coming out with every diamond I can find (We ain't gonna get no sleep)
No sleep, no sleep
Can't stop, yeah (we not, just a lil more, just a lil more, now, just a lil more now)
Can't stop (Just a lil more, now, just a lil more now) we ain’t gonna get no sleep (No sleep)
Side two...

===== Janet Jackson - The Pleasure Principle =====
You might think I'm crazy, but I'm serious
It's better you know now
What I thought was happiness was only part time bliss
You can take a bow
It was all just one big night out on the town
Riding in your limousine
We turned right and I said wrong which brings us to a stop
As the light is changing
Oh, my meters running, so I've got to go now
It's the pleasure principle, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
It's the principle of pleasure, oh-oh
It's the pleasure principle, oh-oh, oh-oh
It's true you want to build your life on guarantees
Hey, take a ride in a big yellow taxi
I'm not here to feed your insecurities
I wanted you to love me
This has become an all too familiar scene
It's not the first time I paid the fare
Where'd you get the idea of material possession?
Thank you for the ride, nowhere
And oh, my meters running, so I've really got to go
It's the pleasure principle, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-hoo
It's the principle of pleasure, oh-oh, ah
It's the pleasure principle oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, ah-ah

You know, what became between you and me
Human differential
Di-da, di, da-da
It's the principle of pleasure
(Oh-oh-ah) It's the pleasure principle, principle (Oh-oh-ah)
You might say, that I'm no good for you
I wouldn't trust your looks, baby, if I could
I got so many, things I wanna do, before I'm through
Hey, yay, di-da, di, da-da
It's the pleasure principle, it's the pleasure principle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's the pleasure principle
Baby, you can't hold me down
After all the love that we've been through
After all you've put me through
Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah (Oh-oh)
Love me, hey, yeah, love me, ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racin' at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight (Yeah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh

===== Christina Aguilera - Beautiful =====
Don't look at me
Mm, mm
Oh
Ooh, oh, mm
Every day is so wonderful
Then suddenly it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain
I'm so ashamed
I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no
So don't you bring me down today
To all your friends you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone
Is that the way it is?
You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down, oh no
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no
No matter what we do (No matter what we do)
No matter what we say (No matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune (Yeah)
Full of beautiful mistakes
And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine)
And tomorrow we might wake on the other side
'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down, oh no
Ooh-oh-oh, yeah
Don't you bring me down today

===== Christina Aguilera - Dirrty =====
Ahh, dirty, dirty, filthy, filthy, nasty
Christina, you nasty (Yeah)
Too dirty to clean my act up (Haha)
If you ain't dirty, you ain't here to party (Woo)
Ladies, move, gentleman, move
Somebody ring the alarm, a fire on the roof
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows (Get up, who ready to party out there?)
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows (Where my dawgs at?)
Uh, let me loose
Ooh, I'm overdue
Give me some room, I'm comin' through
Paid my dues, in the mood
Me and my girls come to shake the room
DJ spinnin' (Show your hands)
Let's get dirty (That's my jam)
I need that, uh, to get me off (Yeah)
Sweatin' 'til my clothes come off
It's explosive, speakers are thumpin'
Still jumpin', six in the mornin'
Table dancin', glasses are crashin'
No question, time for some action
Temperature's up (Can you feel it?), 'bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise
Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival
Ah, heat is up
Ladies, fellas, drop your cups
Bodies packed front to back
Move your ass, I like that
Tight hip-huggers (Low for sure)
Shake a little somethin' (On the floor)
I need that, uh, to get me off
Let's get open, cause a commotion
Still goin', eight in the mornin'
There's no stoppin', we keep it poppin'
Hard rockin', everyone's talkin'
Give all you got (Give it to me), just hit the spot
Rowdy
Ooh, sweat drippin' over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Here it comes, it's the one you been waitin' on
Get up, get it rough, yup, that's what's up
Givin' just what you love to the maximum
Uh-oh (Uh-oh), here we go (Here we go)

That's when we take it to the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops
Woah, yeah, yeah
Yo, hot damn, Doc a jam like a summer show

My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents, I pimp like Huddy roll

F the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo, Christina (What?), better hop in here
My block live and in color like Rodman hair (Yeah)

I'm waiting for sister to act like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a wrap, no bargain deals
I drive a four-wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up, baby, it's Brick City, you heard of that
We blessed, and hung low like Bernie Mac (Bernie Mac?)
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm ODB the way I'm freakin'

===== Christina Aguilera - Fighter =====
Hm
After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you (Ooh)
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger
Well, I, I thought I knew you
Thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm
After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, oh
Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game
I heard you're goin' 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave
After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hold me
But that won't work anymore (No more, uh-huh, it's over)
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
It makes me that much wiser
How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see, you won't stop me
I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough
Makes me work a little bit harder (Oh)
It makes me that much wiser (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (Ha, a fighter)
Made me learn a little bit faster (Yeah)
Made my skin a little bit thicker (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Makes me that much smarter (Yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (Fighter)
You thought I would forget, thought I, I remember (Oh)
'Cause I remember (Oh)
I remember
You thought I would forget (Ooh-ooh)
I remember (Oh-ooh)
Makes me that much stronger (Ooh-ooh)
Makes me work a little bit harder (Ooh-ooh)
It makes me that much smarter

===== Christina Aguilera - Hurt =====
Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today
Ooh, ooh
I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done
Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you
But I know you won't be there
Oh, I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you
Some days I feel broke inside, but I won't admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this
Ooh, ooh, ah
Would you tell me I was wrong?
Would you help me understand?
Are you lookin' down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?
To have just one more chance
To look into your eyes
And see you looking back
And I've hurt myself
Oh, oh
If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away
Oh, it's dangerous
It's so out of line
To try and turn back time
I'm sorry for blaming you
By hurting you

===== Christina Aguilera - Loyal Brave True =====
War is not freedom
Over my shoulder
I see a clearer view
All for my family
Reason I'm breathing
Everything to lose
Should I ask myself in the water
What a warrior would do?
Tell me underneath my armor
Am I loyal, brave and true?
Losing is easy
Winning takes bravery
I am a tiger’s fool
Out in the open
No one to save me
The kindest of whispers are cruel
Should I ask myself in the water
What a warrior would do?
Cold is the morning
Warm is the dream
Chasing the answers
'Til I can't sleep
Will I be stronger
Or will I be weak
When you’re not with me?
Who am I without my armor
Standing in my father's shoes?
All I know is that it's harder
To be loyal, brave and true

===== Christina Aguilera - Can't Hold Us Down =====
Mm
So, what, am I not 'sposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch 'cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled
When a female fires back
Suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me
Slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy (It's so sad)
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say
This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Whoa)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (Whoa)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder!
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground (Stand our ground)
Lift your hands high and wave 'em proud (Whoa)
Take a deep breath and say it loud (Whoa)
"Never can, never will, can't hold us down"
Nobody can hold us down (Hold us down)
Nobody gonna hold us down (Hold us down)
Never can, never will
So, what, am I not 'sposed to say what I'm sayin'?
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'?
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history
It's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
Now I don't understand why it's okay
The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing
This is for my girls all around the world (Around the world)(Yeah)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Respect your worth)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
(You can't get rid of us)
Lettin' 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
(We standin' our ground on this one)
Take a deep breath and say it loud
"Never can, never will, can't hold us down" (Check it)
Here's something I just can't understand
If a guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, then sex her raw
If a girl do the same, then she's a whore
But the tables 'bout to turn, I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas and put they name on it
It's alright though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on movin'
To all my girls with a man who be tryna mack
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got your back
You're just a little boy, you think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big, to make up for smaller things
Said you're just a little boy, all you do is annoy
This is for my girls!
This is for my girls all around the world, oh
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth
(Respect your worth, oh)
So what do we do girls? Shout louder! (Shout louder!)
"Never can, never will, can't hold us down" (Whoa)
This is for my girls all around the world (All my girls)
Who've come across a man that don't respect your worth (Around the world)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard (Yeah)
(Uh, oh-oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Spread the word (Can't hold us down)
Yeah, we here, we back again, yeah
Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera
Yeah (Can't hold us down, uh, uh)

===== Christina Aguilera - Fall In Line =====
Little girls, listen closely
'Cause no one told me
But you deserve to know
That in this world, you are not beholden
You do not owe them
Your body and your soul
All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older
And all the truth in a girl is too precious to be stolen from her
It's just the way it is
And maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
I wasn't made to fall in line
No, I wasn't made to fall in line, no
Show some skin, make him want you
'Cause God forbid you
Know your own way home
Ask yourself why it matters
Who it flatters
You're more than flesh and bones
And maybe it's never gonna change (no)
But I got a mind to show my strength (my strength)
And I got a right to speak my mind (my mind)
And I'm gonna pay for this (pay, pay)
They're gonna burn me at the stake (stake)
But I got a fire in my veins (veins)
I wasn't made to fall in line (line)
No, no, I wasn't made to fall in line
No, we weren't made to fall in line, oh
Yea, two, three
Right — two, three
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March — two, three
Two, three
Who told you you're allowed to think?
And I'm gonna pay for this (I'm gonna pay for this)
'Cause I wasn't made to fall in line
I'm never gonna fall in line, oh

===== Christina Aguilera - Bound To You =====
Sweet love, sweet love, trapped in your love
I've opened up, unsure I can trust
My heart and I, we're buried in dust
Free me, free us
You're all I need, when I'm holding you tight
If you walk away, I will suffer tonight
I found a man I can trust
And boy, I believe in us
I am terrified to love for the first time
Can't you see that I'm bound in chains?
I finally found my way
I am bound to you
So much, so young, I faced on my own
Walls I built up, became my home
I'm strong and I'm sure there's a fire in us
Sweet love, so pure
I catch my breath, we're just one beating heart
And I brace myself
Please, don't tear this apart
I am bound to you, I am bound to-
Suddenly the moment's here
I embrace my fears
All that I have been carrying all these years
Do I risk it all?
Come this far just to fall, fall, oh-oh-oh
I can trust
And finally found my way
I am, oh, I am
I'm bound to you

===== Christina Aguilera - Express =====
It’s a cold and crazy world that's ragin' outside
Well, baby, me and all my girls are bringin' on the fire
Show a little leg, gotta shimmy your chest
It's a life, it's a style, it's a need, it's Burlesque
E-X-P-R-E-S-S, love, sex
Ladies, no regrets
Been holding back for quite some time
And finally the moment's right
I love to make the people stare
They know I got that certain savoir-faire (Hey)
Fasten up
Can you imagine what would happen if I let you close enough to touch?
Step into the fantasy
You'll never wanna leave, baby, that's guaranteed (Why?)
It's a passion, an emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque
It'll move you, goin' through you, so do what I do, Burlesque
All ladies confident, flaunt it, boys throw it up if you want it
Can you feel me? Can you feel it? It's Burlesque
Burlesque
I tease 'em 'til they're on the edge
They scream and moan for more and more they beg, ah
I know it's me they come to see
My pleasure brings them to their knees (Hey, yeah)
Can you imagine what would happen if I let you close enough to touch? (Oh-oh)
You'll never wanna leave, baby that's guaranteed (Why?)
All ladies, confident, flaunt it, boys throw it up if you want it

===== Christina Aguilera - Your Body =====
(Ah-ah)
I came here tonight
To get sh— out of my mind
I'm gonna take what I find
Oh-oh, yeah (Ah-ah)
So open the box
Don't need no key, I'm unlocked
And I won't tell you to stop
Oh-oh, yeah
Ay, boy (Ah-ah)
I don't need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you in
No need for talkin'
So don't even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place
And let's get walkin' (Ah-ah)
All I wanna do is love your body
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh (Ah-ah)
It's true what you heard
I am a freak, I'm disturbed
So come on and give me your worst
Oh-oh, yeah, ha (Ah-ah)
We're moving faster than slow (Faster than slow)
If you don't know where to go (Know where to go)
I'll finish off on my own (I'll finish off on my own)
Oh-oh, yeah-ay
And let's get walkin' (Say, say, hey; Ah-ah)
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh (Your body, yeah, woo; Ah-ah)
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh (Yeah, ay, yeah; Ah-ah)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I think you already know my name (Ah-ah)
Ay, hey, yeah
Ha, alright, say
I think you already know my name
All I wanna do is love your body (Ah, yeah!)
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh (Hey, ay, say; Ah-ah)
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh (Woo-ooh)
All I wanna do is love your body (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh (Say, say, hey, yeah; Ah-ah)
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

===== Christina Aguilera - Reflection =====
Look at me; you may think you see who I really am, but you'll never know me
Every day, it's as if I play a part
Now I see if I wear a mask, I can fool the world, but I cannot fool my heart
Who is that girl I see staring straight back at me?
When will my reflection show who I am inside?
I am now in a world where I have to hide my heart and what I believe in
But somehow I will show the world what's inside my heart and be loved for who I am
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?
Must I pretend that I'm someone else for all time?
There's a heart that must be free to fly
That burns with a need to know the reason why
Why must we all conceal what we think, how we feel?
Must there be a secret me I'm forced to hide?
I won't pretend that I'm someone else for all time

===== P!nk - Just Give Me a Reason =====
Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch, you fixed them
Now you've been talkin' in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough of our love, our love
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear, we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happenin')
You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh
There's nothin' more than empty sheets between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love, love
I never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken, just bent
Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collectin' dust
But our love's enough
You're holdin' it in
You're pourin' a drink
No, nothin' is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean
That we're not broken, just bent
Just a second we're not broken, just bent
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
Oh, we can learn to love again
Oh, can learn to love again
Oh, that we're not broken, just bent

===== P!nk - What About Us =====
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da
We are searchlights, we can see in the dark
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far
What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
We are problems that want to be solved
We are children that need to be loved
We were willin', we came when you called
But man, you fooled us
Enough is enough, oh
Oh, what about us?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?
Sticks and stones, they may break these bones
But then, I'll be ready, are you ready?
It's the start of us, waking up, come on
Are you ready? I'll be ready
I don't want control, I want to let go
'Cause now it's time to let them know
We are ready, what about us?
So, what about us?

===== P!nk - Try =====
Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better
To never ask why
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You gotta get up and try, try, try
Eh, eh, eh
Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy?
Even when it's not right
Ever worried that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry?
When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by?
Tell me, are you just getting by, by, by?

===== P!nk - Raise Your Glass =====
Right, right, turn off the lights
We gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the dealio?
I love when it's all too much
5 AM, turn the radio up
Where's the rock 'n roll?
Party crasher, panty snatcher
Call me up if you a gangsta (Uh)
Don't be fancy, just get dancy
Why so serious?
So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty-gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and, come on and raise your glass?
Just come on and, come on and raise your glass
Slam, slam, oh, hot damn
What part of party don't you understand?
Wish you'd just freak out (Freak out already)
Can't stop, coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
It's so on right now (It's so fuckin' on right now)
Call me up if you a gangsta
Oh shit! My glass is empty
That sucks!
So if you're too school for cool (I mean)
And you're treated like a fool (Treated like a fool)
You can choose to let it go
We can always, we can always party on our own
So raise your (Ah, fuck)
And nitty-gritty, dirty, little freaks (So raise your glass)
Won't you come on and, come on and raise your glass? (For me)
For me

===== P!nk - So What =====
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
I guess I just lost my husband
I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money
I'm not gonna pay his rent (Nope)
I got a brand new attitude
And I'm gonna wear it tonight
I wanna get in trouble
I wanna start a fight
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, I wanna start a fight
So, so what? I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what? I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright, I'm just fine
And you're a tool, so
So what? I am a rock star
And I don't want you tonight
Uh, check my flow, uh
The waiter just took my table
And gave it to Jessica Simp— (Shit)
I guess I'll go sit with drum boy
At least he'll know how to hit (Oops)
What if this song's on the radio?
Then somebody's gonna die
I'm gonna get in trouble
My ex'll start a fight
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, he's gonna start a fight (Huh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, we're all gonna get in a fight
I'm alright (I'm alright), I'm just fine
You weren't there, you never were
You want it all, but that's not fair
I gave you life, I gave my all
You weren't there, you let me fall
And now that we're done (We're done)
I'm alright (I'm alright), I'm just fine (I'm just fine)
So what? I am a rock star (Oh)
And I don't want you tonight (I don't want you tonight)
No, no
I don't want you tonight
You weren't there
I'm gonna show you tonight (I'm gonna show you tonight)
Woo-hoo
Ba-da-da-da-da-da

===== P!nk - Cover Me In Sunshine =====
I've been dreaming, friendly faces
I've got so much time to kill
Just imagine people laughing
I know some day we will
And even if it's far away
Get me through another day
Cover me in sunshine
Shower me with good times
Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning
And everything'll be alright
From a distance all these mountains
Are just some tiny hills
Wildflowers, they keep living
While they're just standing still
I've been missing yesterday
But what if there's a better place?
La la la la

===== P!nk - Walk Me Home =====
There's somethin' in the way you roll your eyes
Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good
Tryna stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside
There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
Say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
'Cause there is so much wrong, there is so much wrong
There is so much wrong goin' on outside

===== P!nk - Who Knew =====
You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh-huh, that's right
I took your words, and I believed
In everything you said to me
Yeah-huh, that's right
If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong
I know better 'cause you said forever
And ever, who knew?
Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool?
Oh no, no, no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you, friend
I'd give anything
When someone said count your blessings now
'Fore they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
They knew better, still, you said forever
(Yeah, yeah)
I'll keep you locked in my head (In my head)
Until we meet again (Meet again)
Until we, until we meet again
And I won't forget you, my friend
What happened?
'Cause they're all wrong and
That last kiss, I'll cherish until we meet again
And time makes it harder, I wish I could remember
But I keep your memory, you visit me in my sleep
My darling, who knew?
My darling, my darling, who knew?
My darling, I miss you
Who knew?

===== P!nk - F**kin' Perfect =====
Made a wrong turn, once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss "Knowing it's all good” it didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated, look, I'm still around
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you are perfect to me
You're so mean (You're so mean) when you talk (When you talk)
About yourself, you were wrong
Change the voices (Change the voice) in your head (In your head)
Make them like you instead
So complicated, look how we all make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same, oh-oh
The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer
So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard, and it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that? Why do I do that?
Why do I do that?
Yeah, oh, oh
Pretty, pretty, pretty
Yeah-eh
Yeah, you're perfect, you're perfect to me
Pretty, pretty please, oh, if you ever, ever feel

===== P!nk - Just Like Fire =====
I know that I am runnin' out of time
I want it all, mm-mm
And I'm wishin' they'd stop tryna turn me off
I want it on, mm-mm
And I'm walkin' on a wire, trying to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
We came here to run it, run it, run it (Uh-huh)
We came here to run it (Yeah), run it (Uh), run it
Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I can light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like magic, I'll be flyin' free
I'ma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
Just like fire
Uh
And people like to laugh at you
'Cause they are all the same, mm-mm (Uh)
See I would rather we just go a different way (Yeah?)
Than play the game (Uh-uh), mm-mm
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
You and me together, forever and ever
We don't have to worry 'bout a thing (No), about a thing (Not a thing), no (Hah)
We came here to run it (Yeah), run it (Uh), run it (Mm-hmm, mm-hmm)
We came here to run it (Run it), run it (C’mon), run it (Oh, oh)
Just like fire, fire, fire
Run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it (Ay, ay), run it, run it (Uh, uh)
So look, I came here to run it (Yup)
Just cause nobody's done it (Uh-huh)
Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I been here, I done it
Impossible? Please
Watch, I do it with ease
You just gotta believe
Come on, come on with me
Oh, what's a girl to do? (What, what?)
Hey, what's a girl to do? (What, what?)
Mmm, what's a girl to do?
Just like fire (Just like fire), burnin' up the way
If I can light the world up for just one day (One day)
Watch this madness, colorful charade (Hey, hey)
Oh, just like magic, I'll be flyin' free
Just like fire, fire (Run it, run it, run it)
Just like fire (We came here to run it, run it, run it)

===== P!nk - TRUSTFALL =====
Trust fall, baby
It's a trust fall, baby
Picture a place where it all doesn't hurt
Where everything's safe and it doesn't get worse, oh my
We see through bloodshot eyes
Picture a place, somewhere else far away
Where you know what they mean and they mean what they say to us
And would that be enough?
Are we running out of time?
Are we hiding from the light?
Are we just too scared to fight for what we want tonight?
Closе your eyes and leavе it all behind
Go where love is on our side
You and I and everyone alive
We can run into the fire
Yeah, it's a trust fall, baby
Jump with me, come with me, burn like the sun
We'll talk, then we'll cry, then we'll laugh 'til we're done, oh my
It's like we're out our minds
We've been running for our lives
We've been hiding from the light
We've been far too scared to fight for what we want tonight
Close your eyes and leave it all behind
What if we just fall?
I'm not going without you
You're not going alone
I fell so far 'til I found you
But you know what you know when you know
So I'm not going without you
'Cause you know when you know
What if we just—

===== P!nk - Get the Party Started =====
Ha-ha
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started
Get this party started on a Saturday night
Everybody's waiting for me to arrive
Sending out the message to all of my friends
We'll be looking flashy in my Mercedes Benz
I got lots of style, check my gold diamond rings
I can go for miles if you know what I mean
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')
Pumping up the volume, breaking down to the beat
Cruising through the Westside, we'll be checking the scene
Boulevard is freaking as I'm coming up fast
I'll be burning rubber, you'll be kissing my ass
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car
License plate says, "Stunner: #1 Superstar"
(I'm comin' up, so you better)
Get this party started
Making my connection as I enter the room
Everybody's chillin' as I set up the groove
Pumping up the volume with this brand new beat
Everybody's dancing and they're dancing for me
I'm your operator, you can call anytime
I'll be your connection to the party line
Get this party started (Ooh)
Get this party started right now

===== P!nk - Just Like a Pill =====
I'm lyin' here on the floor where you left me
I think I took too much
I'm cryin' here, what have you done?
I thought it would be fun
I can't stay on your life support
There's a shortage in the switch
I can't stay on your morphine
'Cause it's making me itch
I said I tried to call the nurse again
But she's bein' a little bitch
I think I'll get outta here
Where I can run, just as fast as I can
To the middle of nowhere
To the middle of my frustrated fears
And I swear, you're just like a pill
Instead of making me better
You keep making me ill
I haven't moved from the spot where you left me
This must be a bad trip
All of the other pills
They were different
Maybe I should get some help
Run just as fast as I can
There's a shortage in the switch (Just like a pill)
'Cause it's making me itch (Just like a pill)
But she's bein' a little bitch (Just like a pill)
To the middle of my frustrated fears (Frustrated fears, I swear)
You keep making me...
You keep making me ill (You're makin' me, makin me ill)
To the middle of nowhere (Ah)
To the middle of my frustrated fears (Yeah)
And I swear, you're just like a pill (Yeah)
Instead of making me better (Oh-oh)
You keep making me ill (Oh, you're making me run)
And I swear

===== P!nk - True Love =====
Sometimes I hate every single stupid word you say
Sometimes I wanna slap you in your whole face (Whoa-oh-oh)
There's no one quite like you
You push all my buttons down
I know life would suck without you (Whoa-oh-oh)
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
You're an asshole, but I love you
And you make me so mad, I ask myself (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much, I think it must be
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
And no one else can break my heart like you
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yo-oh-oh-oh
Just once, try to wrap your little brain around my feelings
Just once, please try not to be so mean (Whoa-oh-oh)
Repeat after me now R-O-M-A-N-C-E-E-E
Come on, I'll say it slowly (Romance)
You can do it, babe
And you make me so mad I ask myself (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I think it must be love (I love you)
Why do you rub me up the wrong way?
Why do you say the things that you say?
Sometimes I wonder how we ever came to be
But without you, I'm incomplete
Oh, I think it must be
True love (It must be), true love
It must be true love (It must be)
And no one else can break my heart like you (Like you)
No one else can break my heart like you (Like you)
No one else can break my heart like you (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

===== P!nk - Blow Me (One Last Kiss) =====
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
'Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home
Da, da da da da, da da da da
I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe, I will breathe
I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the "why's" will all be crystal clear
La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la
Have you had a shit day?

===== P!nk - Beautiful Trauma =====
We were on fire
I slashed your tires
It's like we burn so bright, we burn out
I made you chase me
I wasn't that friendly
My love, my drug, we're fucked up, oh
'Cause I've been on the run so long they can't find me
You're waking up to remember I'm pretty
And when the chemicals leave my body
Yeah, they're gonna find me in a hotel lobby 'cause
Mmm, tough
Times they keep comin'
All night
Laughin' and fuckin'
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
After we were high and the love dope died it was you
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, (Oh) my love, my drug, we're fucked up
You punched a hole in
The wall and I framed it
I wish I could feel things like you
Everyone's chasing
That holy feeling
And if we don't stay lit we'll blow out
Blow out
'Cause we've been on the run so long they can't find us
Who's gonna have to die to remind us
That it feels like we chose this blindly
Now I'm gonna fuck up a hotel lobby
'Cause these tough
Last night
I might have messed it up again
But after we were high and the love dope died it was you
(My drug) My love, my love, my drug, we're fucked up
Mmm tough
My love, my love, my drug, oh (Drug)

===== P!nk - A Million Dreams =====
I close my eyes and I can see
A world that's waiting up for me that I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one’s been before
But it feels like home
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don’t care, if they call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we're gonna make
There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled with things from far away
Special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile on a rainy day
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
See, I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy
Run away to a world that we design
A million dreams is all it’s gonna take
Oh, a million dreams for the world we’re gonna make
However big, however small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
We may be right, we may be wrong
But I wanna bring you along to the world I see
To the world we close our eyes to see
We close our eyes to see
Every night, I lie in bed
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make
For the world we're gonna make

===== P!nk - Sober =====
I don't wanna be the girl that laughs the loudest
Or the girl who never wants to be alone
I don't wanna be that call at four o'clock in the morning
'Cause I'm the only one you know in the world that won't be home
Ah, sun is blinding
I stayed up again
Oh, I am finding
That's not the way I want my story to end
I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me
Why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside
You're my protection
But how do I feel this good sober?
I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence
The quiet scares me 'cause it screams the truth
Please don't tell me that we had that conversation (I know we did)
'Cause I won't remember, save your breath 'cause what's the use? (Ooh)
Ah, the night is calling
And it whispers to me softly, "Come and play"
I, I am falling
And if I let myself go, I'm the only one to blame
But why do I feel this party's over? (Oh, whoa, whoa)
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober? (Oh)
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round
I'm looking for myself sober
Looking for myself sober
When it's good then it's good, it's so good 'til it goes bad
'Til you're tryin' to find the you that you once had
I have heard myself cry, never again
Broken down in agony and just tryin' to find a friend
Oh
Nothing can touch me (Nothing can touch me)
But why do I feel this party's over? (But why do I feel this party's over?)
No pain (No) inside (No)
But how do I feel this good sober? (How do I feel this good sober?)
I'm safe up high (Nothing)
But why do I feel this party's over? (Over)

===== P!nk - Can We Pretend =====
I remember conversations
We were dancing up on tables
Taking pictures when we had nowhere to post
You were laughin', I was cryin'
We were dancin', we were dyin'
Sometimes I don't know how we walked away
If I'm honest what I liked
Were the things we didn't know
Every morning, every night
I'd be beating down your door
Just to tell you what I'm thinking
But you already know
Screw this, I don't wanna let it go
So can we pretend that I'm 22 today?
Dancin' on the tables with you, oh yeah
Can we pretend that we all end up okay?
I just wanna forget with you, oh yeah
Can we pretend that we both like the president?
Can we pretend that I really like your shoes? Hell yeah
Can we pretend? 'Cause honestly, reality, it bores me
Let's pretend, oh, let's make believe
Can we, can we pretend?
Can we pretend?
I remember what we wanted
What we'd never take for granted
How our daddy issues took us to LA
If I'm honest, what I miss
Is not knowin' what to say
And the feeling of your lips
And it haunts me every day
When you'd tell me what you're thinking
But I'd already know
Oh yeah
Can we pretend that we both like the way it is? Hell yeah
Can we pretend that we like these fake-ass dudes? Oh yeah
If I'm honest, what I liked
But you'd already know
Can we pretend that you like my fake-ass shoes? Oh yeah
Can we pretend? Cause honestly reality, it bores me
Oh, can we pretend?
Can we? Let's make believe
Can we (Can we)
Honestly

===== P!nk - Never Gonna Not Dance Again =====
If someone told me that the world would end tonight
You could take all that I got, for once I wouldn't start a fight (Yeah, right)
You could have my liquor, take my dinner, take my fun
My birthday cake, my soul, my dog, take everything I love
But, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do
Is throw away my dancing shoes
And, oh, Lord, don't try me, really, not tonight
I'll lay down and die, I'll scream and I'll cry
We've already wasted enough time
I'm never gonna not dance again
Oh, I just wanna pop and lock to my records
There go all of my clothes
Never gonna not dance again
D-d-d-dance, I'm gonna dance, bruh
D-d-d-dance, I'm gonna dance
I want my life to be a Whitney Houston song (I wanna dance)
I got all good luck and zero fucks, don't care if I belong, no
If I could kill the thing that makes us all so dumb
We're never getting younger, so I'm gonna have some fun
'Cause, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do
I'll lay down and die (I'll lay down and die)
I'll scream and I'll cry (I'll scream and I'll cry)
Know that I'm starting a fight
D-d-d-dance, I'm gonna dance, yeah, d-d-d-dance
You know that I'm starting a fight (Fight)
Never gonna not dance again (Hey, hey)
Never gonna not dance again (Never gonna not dance again)
Dance again (Let the music play 'til the end)
Dance again (Never gonna not dance again)
Dance again
Let the music play 'til the end (Hey)
Let it play, yeah
Come on, come on
(I'm never gonna not gonna dance again)
(So let the music play 'til the end)
Yeah, yeah
I'm never gonna not gonna dance again
So let the music play 'til the end
(Why'd it stop?)

===== Ariana Grande - One Last Time =====
I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm bein' honest
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better 'cause you don't want a liar
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything

So, one last time

All I really care is you wake up in my arms

===== Ariana Grande - Dangerous Woman =====
Oh, yeah
Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger
Don't ya stop, boy (Oh, yeah)
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that

===== Ariana Grande - we can't be friends (wait for your love) =====
I didn't think you'd understand me
How could you ever even try?
I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die
And I'll be alright
We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again
Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love
Me and my truth, we sit in silence
Mm
Baby girl, it's just me and you
'Cause I don't wanna argue, but I don't wanna bite
My tongue, yeah, I think I'd rather die
You got me misunderstood
But at least I look this good
I'll wait for your love
Know that you made me
I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hanging
Not what you made me
It's somethin' like a daydream
But I feel so seen in the night
So for now, it's only me
And maybe that's all I need

===== Ariana Grande - Santa Tell Me =====
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here
Oh, woah
Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care)
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me, boy)
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa, baby)
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here)
Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?)

One strike and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in your bed, singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on our hands
Might as well cancel our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime
So, lock the door and throw out the key
Can't fight this no more, it's just you and me
And there's nothin' I, nothin' I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So, go ahead and drive me insane
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't change
Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby
There's nowhere we need to be, no, no, no
I'ma get to know you better
Kinda hope we're here forever
There's nobody on these streets
If you told me that the world's endin'
Ain't no other way that I can spend it
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Ooh)
Got all this time in my hands
Might as well cancel our plans (Yeah, yeah)
I could stay here forever
Baby, run your mouth, I still wouldn't trade
Woah

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm

All I need is to see your face
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah

It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me

Things we've always been afraid of

Frozen, slowly thawin', got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me

===== Madonna - Material Girl =====
Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (that's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right
'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest
Then I have to let them be
Some boys try, and some boys lie
But I don't let them play (no way)
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day
Living in a material world
Ah-ah
Ah-ooh
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world (ah-ah)
Boys may come, and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me
'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl (ah-ah)

===== Adele - Hello =====
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)

When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, give me the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

===== Ed Sheeran - Shape of You =====
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

===== Ed Sheeran - The A Team =====
White lips, pale face
Breathin' in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
"The worst things in life come free to us"
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, banknotes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
But she don't wanna go outside tonight
An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And we're all under the upper hand
And we don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man

===== Amy Winehouse - Back To Black =====
He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet with his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry, get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked, I'll go back to black
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her, and I go back to-
I go back to us
I love you much
It's not enough, you love blow and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rollin' up the walls inside
You go back to her, and I go back to black

===== Billie Eilish - BIRDS OF A FEATHER =====
I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm going too, uh
'Cause it was always you, alright
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothing left to lose without my baby
Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better
And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I
I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
I want you to see, hm
How you look to me, hm
You wouldn't believe if I told ya
You would keep the compliments I throw ya
But you're so full of shit, uh
Tell me it's a bit, no
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid
Might not be long, but baby, I
Don't wanna say goodbye
Birds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('til the day that I die)
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('til the light leaves my eyes)
Can't change the weather, might not be forever ('til the day I die)
I knew you in another life
You had that same look in your eyes
I love you, don't act so surprised

===== Billie Eilish - everything i wanted =====
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (might care, might care)
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say, "As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change
The way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
They don't deserve you"
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
If I knew it all then would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

===== Billie Eilish - i love you =====
It's not true
Tell me I've been lied to
Crying isn't like you
Ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through
Ooh, hm, hm
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you
And I don't want to
Up all night
On another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
I
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
I, hm-hm
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can't escape the way I love you

===== Billie Eilish - ocean eyes =====
I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

===== Billie Eilish - bury a friend =====
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

===== Billie Eilish - wish you were gay =====
"Baby, I don't feel so good", six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go", five words you'll never say (aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (hahahahaha)
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12-step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times, you never made it there
I ate alone at seven, you were six minutes away
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest, an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day
But all you do is look the other way, hmm

===== Coldplay - Viva La Vida =====
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead, long live the king
One minute, I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
For some reason I can't explain

===== Lana Del Rey - Summertime Sadness =====
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore (one, two, three, four)
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive (drive), drive

===== Lana Del Rey - Say Yes To Heaven =====
If you dance, I'll dance
And if you don't, I'll dance anyway
Give peace a chance
Let the fear you have fall away
I've got my eye on you
Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me
If you go, I'll stay
You come back, I'll be right here
Like a barge at sea
In the storm, I stay clear
'Cause I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you
I'll put my red dress on, get it on
And if you fight, I'll fight
It doesn't matter now, it's all gone
I got my mind on you

===== Lana Del Rey - National Anthem =====
Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em, reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?"
He said, "Yes, yes, yes"
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow, down, making me so wow now)
(Sugar, sugar, how now? Take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in your eyes
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact (kiss, kiss)
I sing the national anthem while I'm standin'
Over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me, or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He said to be cool but, I'm already coolest
I said to get real, "Don't you know who you're dealing with?"
"Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?"
It's a love story for the new age, for the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin'
Excessive buyin', overdose and dyin'
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurrin' the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his bell tower hotel
So put on mascara and your party dress
I'm your national anthem, boy, put your hands up
Give me a standin' ovation
Boy, you have landed, babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

===== Rihanna - Umbrella =====
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me (you know me)
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, -ella, -ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, -ella, -ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, -ella, -ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh
These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So gonna let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
It's raining, raining
Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining
Baby, come into me, come into me
You can always come into me, come into me
It's pouring rain, it's pouring rain
Come into me, come into me

===== Rihanna - Needed Me =====
Mustard on the beat, ho!
I was good on my own, that's the way it was
That's the way it was
You was good on the low for a faded f-
On some faded love
Sh-, what the f- you complaining for?
Feeling jaded, huh?
Used to trip off that sh- I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run, though I'll give it to you
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another n- on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad b-
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
F- your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it
You needed me
Ooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby, ooh, you needed me
You been rollin' around, sh- I'm rollin up
Light and roll it up
Break it down like a pound, sh- was never us
Sh- was never us
That's the real on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that sh- I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run, though I give it to ya
But baby, don't get it twisted (don't get)
Ooh (ooh), you needed me (you needed me)
To feel a little more, and give a little less (ooh)

===== Rihanna - Work =====
He said me haffi

Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
So me put in
When you ah guh
Learn, learn, learn, learn, learn
Meh nuh cyar if him

Dry me ah desert him
Nuh time to have you lurking
Him ah go act like he nah like it
You know I dealt with you the nicest
Nuh body touch me in the righteous
Nuh botha text me in a crisis
I believed all of your dreams, adoration
You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been
Mmm-mmm
But I wake up and act like nothing's wrong
Just get ready fi
Ner ner ner ner ner ner
When you a guh learn, learn learn, learn, learn
Before the tables turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn
Beg you something please
Baby don't you leave
Don't leave me stuck here in the streets, uh-huh
If I get another chance to

I mean who am I to hold your past against you?

I hope that you see this through
I hope that you see this true
What can I say?
Please recognize I'm tryin' babe

Yeah, okay
You need to get done, done, done, done at work, come over
We just need to slow the motion
Don't give that away to no one
Long distance, I need you
When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I'm sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the

===== Black Eyed Peas - Where Is The Love? =====
What's wrong with the world, Mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryna stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt, and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questioning
Where is the love?
(Love) Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love? (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love?
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong
With this world that we livin' in? People keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the truth, y'all? Come on (I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity? (Yeah)
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? (Yeah)
Instead of spreading love, we spreading animosity (Yeah)
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself
Now sing with me, y'all (One world, one world)
We only got (One world, one world)
That's all we got (One world, one world)
And something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with it (Yeah)
Something's wrong with the w-world, world, yeah

Welcome
Welcome to The E.N.D
Do not panic, there is nothing to fear
Everything around you is changing
Nothing stays the same
This version of myself is not permanent

===== Black Eyed Peas - Shut Up =====
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Oh no)
We try to take it slow, but we're still losin' control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst and I'm crazy
For tryna be your lady
I think I'm goin' crazy
Girl, me and you were just fine, you know
We wined and dined, did them things
That couples do when in love, you know
Walks on the beach and stuff, you know
Things that lovers say and do
"I love you, boo", "I love you too"
"I miss you a lot", "I miss you even more"
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour
But then something got outta hand
You started yellin' why I would break plans (What did you say to me?)
Even though I had legitimate reasons (Bullshit)
You know I had to make them dividends (Bullshit)
How could you trust your private eyes, girl?
That's why you don't believe my lies and quick to say
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
I think I'm goin' crazy (Why, why, why)
Why does emotion gotta move so fast?
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on takin' it slow?
So why has it got to be so damn tough?
'Cause fools in lust could never get enough
Of love; showin' him the love that you be givin'
Changin' up your livin' for a lovin' transition (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, it's a mission tryin' to get you to listen
Screamin' at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin', "Who the hell?!"
Who the hell? What the hell's goin' down?
Too much of the bickering, kill it with the sound and
But it still ends up the worst and I'm crazy (For what?)
(Crazy for what?) For tryna be your lady (Oh yeah?)
I think I'm goin' crazy (Uh, uh), woah-oh
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (What?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Whatcha say?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Say what?)
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up (Girl, whatcha say?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Girl, whatcha say?)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (No, girl)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Shut up, you shut up, shut up)
Girl, our love is dyin'
Why did you stop tryin'?
I never been a quitta, but I do deserve betta
Believe me, I will do bad
Let's forget the past and start this new plan
Why? 'Cause it's the same old routine
And then next week I hear them scream
Girl, I know you're tired of the things they say
You're damn right
'Cause I heard them lame damn excuses just yesterday
That was a different thing
(No, it ain't)
It was the same damn thing, same ass excuses
Boy, you're useless, woah, oh!
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Just stop)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Oh no) (Just stop)
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up (Just stop)
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Stop all the talking)

Shut it up, just shut up, shut up (Stop all the talking)
Stop the talking, baby (Just stop)

Stop the talking, baby (Just stop) (Yeah, yeah)
Stop the talking, baby (Stop all the talking)
Or I start walking, baby (Stop all the talking) (Oh no, oh, oh, oh)
Or I start walking, baby (Stop all the talking)
Stop the talking, baby (Just stop) (Is that all there is?)
Stop the talking, baby (Stop all the talking) (Is that all there is?)
Stop your yapping, baby (Just stop) (Is that all there is?)
Just look what happened, baby (Just stop)
Stop your yapping, baby (Stop all the talking) (Is that all there is?)
Just look what happened, baby (Stop all the talking)
Is that all there is?

===== Black Eyed Peas - Don't Lie =====
Yeah, uh-uh
La, da, da, da, da-da
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
Hey baby, my nose is gettin' big
I noticed it be growin' when I be tellin' them fibs, now
You say your trust's gettin' weaker
Probably 'cause my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learned my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it, I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I've been a little immature
With your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies, I was the editor
And the author, I forged my signature
And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cause what you did to me I did to you
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie
'Cause you know, know, know, know
Yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I really see you, what you're all about?
'Cause you know, you know, you know, you know
You know you gotta try (Stop, st-stop, stop, st-stop stop lying)
She said, "I'm leaving"
'Cause she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love, it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed, too many games
She feelin' like a fool gettin' on the last train
Tryna maintain, but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things
Oh, and I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie
And now our emotions are drained
'Cause I lie and I lie and a little lie, lie
And now your emotions are drained
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (Don't, don't you lie)
Yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try (Got to, got to try)
What you gonna do when it all comes out (What you gonna do, baby?)
Because you know, you know, you know, you know
You know you gotta try
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh (Ba da, ba da, ba ba ba ba)
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh (Ba da da, ba da da, ba da da, ba da da)
Hmm, yo, I'm lyin' to my girl
Even though I love her and she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls
She the one that make me feel on top of the world
Still I'm lyin' to my girl, I do it
Oh, and I lie and I lie and I lie and then I lie
'Til there's not turning back
I don't know why I lie and I lie
'Til I don't know who I am
But then I tell myself
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no, don't lie (Don't you lie)
Yeah, you know, know, know, know, you gotta try (You know, you know you gotta)
No, no, no, no, baby, no, no, no, no

===== Black Eyed Peas - Hey Mama =====
La la la la la la
Hey mama, this that shit that make you move, mama
Get on the floor and move your booty, mama
We the blast masters, blastin' up the jamma
(Rewind!)
Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing in the city of sin, and
Hey shorty, I know you wanna party
And the way your body look really make me feel naughty
And the way your body look, it make me really feel naughty
I got a naughty naughty style and a naughty naughty crew
But everything I do, I do just for you
I'm a little bit of old, and a little bit of new
The true niggas know that the Peas come through
We never cease (No), we never die, no we never decease (No)
We multiply like we math-matice
And then drop bombs like we in the Middle East
(The bomb bombers, the bass boom drummers)
Now y'all know, who we are
Y'all know, we the stars
Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
And lookin' hard without bodyguards

This that shit that make you groove, mama
(Yaw) We the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma (Whoa)
(La la la la la)
We the big town stompas, and big sound pumpas
The beat bump bumps in your trunk trunkas
The girlies in the club got the plump lump lumpas
And when I'm makin' love, my hip hump humps
It never quits (No), we need to carry nine millimeter clips (No)
Don't wanna squeeze triggers, just wanna squeeze tits
(Lova, lova) 'cause we the show stoppas
And the chief rockas, number one chief rockas
Now y'all know (Who we are)
Y'all know (We the stars)

How we rockin' it girl (Without bodyguards)
She be (Fergie)
From the crew (BEP)

(So come on papa, dance to the drummer)
(Yaw) We the blast mastas blastin' up the jamma (Naw, nawy)
And he way your body look, it make me really feel naughty
But the race is not for the swift
But for who can endure it
And Tippa Irie and the Black Eyed Peas

'Til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity, 'til infinity
Blackadow
Kcohs a med a ffun, Nuff a dem a shock
Nuff a dem a shock, nuff a dem a sting

And di way di tune nice, it finga-licking

===== The Beach Boys - Wouldn't It Be Nice =====
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
But happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray, it might come true (Run, run, we-ooh)
Oh, baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Oh, we could be married (Oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
But wouldn't it be nice?
Goodnight, my baby
Sleep tight, my baby

===== The Beach Boys - Good Vibrations =====
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears

On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

She's giving me excitations (Oom-bop-bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop-bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop-bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my-my, what a sensation)

Jamaica
Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo

To get away from it all
Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you
To Bermuda, Bahama, come on, pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, Ooh, baby why don't we go?

Way down in Kokomo
Martinique, that Montserrat mystique
We'll put out to sea
And we'll perfect our chemistry
By and by, we'll defy
A little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Key Largo, Montego, Ooh baby, why don't we go?
Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
Port au Prince, I want to catch a glimpse
Everybody knows
A little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go
Go down to Kokomo
I wanna take you down to Kokomo…

And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled
It's the little Saint Nick
(Oooooh, little Saint Nick)
Just a little bobsled, we call it old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy-apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel
Run, run, reindeer
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
He don't miss no one
And haulin' through the snow at a frightenin' speed
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead
He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every pad with a little surprise
(Aaa-aaa-aaah)
(Ooooooooh, merry Christmas Saint Nick)

And makes me realize
When she says, "Don't worry, baby"
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out all right (Don't worry, baby)
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive
She told me, "Baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you, baby
Nothing could go wrong with you"
Oh, what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says, "Don't worry, baby"

===== The Beach Boys - Heroes And Villains =====
I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long long time
Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Of the heroes and villains
Once at night, cotillion squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets
That eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do
In a town full of heroes and villains
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Stand or fall
I know there shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair of my life
With the heroes and villains
My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe, healthy, wealthy, and wise
(Boys and)
(Girls and)

I've been in this town so long
So long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff, I'm alright

So I'm gonna fight, gonna give it my all
Gonna make you fall, gonna sock it to you
That's right, I'm the last one standing
And another one bites the dust
Let me hear you say, this shit is bananas
B-A-N-A-N-A-S
This shit is bananas
Again, the shit is bananas

===== Gwen Stefani - Rich Girl =====
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
If I was a rich girl
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
See, I'd have all the money in the world
If I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me
My cash flow would never ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world
Think what that money could bring
I'd buy everything
Clean out Vivienne Westwood
In my Galliano gown
No, wouldn't just have one hood
A Hollywood mansion if I could
Please book me, first class, to my fancy house in London town
All the riches, baby
Won't mean anything
Don't bring what your love can bring
Don't need no other baby
Your loving is better than gold and I know
I'd get me four Harajuku girls to (Uh-huh)
Inspire me, and they'd come to my rescue
I'd dress them wicked, I'd give them names (Yeah)
Love, Angel, Music, Baby
Hurry up and come and save me
Won't bring what your love can bring
Come together all over the world
From the hoods of Japan, Harajuku Girls
What? It's all love
What? Give it up! What?
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter (What?)
What happened to my life? Turned upside down
Chicks dat blew ya mind, ding, it's the second round
Original track and ting, mmm
You know you can't buy these things, no
See Stefani and her L.A.M.B
I rock the Fetish, people you know who I am!
Yes, ma'am, we got the style that's wicked
I hope you can all keep up
We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top
Now we ain't gettin' nothing but love

===== Gwen Stefani - You Make It Feel Like Christmas =====
Ooh, ooh
I want to thank the storm that brought the snow
Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow
But I want to thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
It barely took a breath to realize
We're going to be a classic for all time
I want to thank you, baby
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can't believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too
Thought I was done for, thought that love had died
But you came along, I swear you saved my life
And I want to thank you, baby (I want to thank you)
'Cause you make it feel like Christmas
(You make it feel like Christmas)
I never thought I'd find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss
I want to thank you, baby (I want to thank you)
Ooh
(Oh thank you, baby)

===== Gwen Stefani - Luxurious =====
C'est pas possible cet amour
C'est incroyable
Tu me fais transpirer
C'est parfait
Working so hard every night and day
And now we get the pay back
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
The pay back, the pay back
Champagne kisses, hold me in your lap of luxury
I only wanna fly first-class desires
You're my limousine
So elegant, the way we ride
Our passion, it just multiplies
There's platinum lightning in the sky
Look, I'm livin' like a queen
This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, ba-by
We're luxurious, like Egyptian cotton
We're so rich in love, we're rollin' in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in the rough is lookin' so sparkly
Sugar, honey, sexy baby
When we touch, it turns to gold
Sensitive and delicate, kinda like a tuberose
You know you are my treasure chest
It's pure perfection when we kiss and
You're my Mr., I'm your Ms
Gonna be until we're old
We know how to live, baby
Working so hard, every night and day
Cha-ching, cha-ching
We're loaded, and we're not gonna blow it
We're hooked up with the love 'cause we grow it
We got hydroponic love and we're smokin'
We burn it, you and I, we are so lit
We're so rich in love, we're rollin in cashmere
And now we get to lay back (This is how we roll)
Now we get to lay back (Luxurious)
And now we get the payback (Baby, we are so... ex-pen-sive ...oh)
The payback, the payback, oh
T'es si jolie
C'est pas possible...  (This is how we roll, do you feel it?)
C'est jamais assez (So luxurious, I feel you)
Tu m'fais plein (Baby, we're so expensive)
Toutes les choses
Tu m'fais sentir (This is how we roll)
Je suis bien avec toi
Je suis bien
(So luxurious)

===== Gwen Stefani - What You Waiting For? =====
What an amazing time
What a family
How did the years go by?
Now it's only me
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock, tick-tock
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Like a cat in heat stuck in a moving car
A scary conversation, shut my eyes, can't find the brake
What if they say that you're a climber?
Naturally I'm worried if I do it alone
Who really cares? 'Cause it's your life
You never know, it could be great
Take a chance 'cause you might grow
Oh, oh-oh
What you waiting, what you waiting
What you waiting for?
Take a chance, you stupid ho
Like an echo pedal, you're repeating yourself
You know it all by heart, why are you standing in one place? (Uh-huh)
Born to blossom, bloom to perish
Your moment will run out 'cause of your sex chromosome
I know it's so messed up how our society all thinks (For sure)
Life is short, you're capable (Uh-huh)
Look at your watch now
You're still a super-hot female
You got your million-dollar contract
And they're all waiting for your hot track!
I can't wait to go back and do Japan
Get me lots of brand new fans
Osaka, Tokyo
You Harajuku girls
Damn, you've got some wicked style... go!

===== Gwen Stefani - Bubble Pop Electric =====
C'mon, Johnny! When you gonna get here?
All right, hold your pretty horses, I'll be there in a minute
You just get yourself dolled up, alright Toots?
You pick a place, you just pick a place!
Um, Johnny?
Yeah, Gwennie-Gwen-Gwen?
You might wanna hurry, because tonight is the night!
I'm empty
I need fulfillin', yes, I do love
To the ceilin' when I do love
I get this feelin' when I'm in love
I'm restless
Can't you see I try my best'est
To be good girl, because it's just us
So take me now and do me justice
I'm waiting
Patiently anticipating
Your arrival, and I'm hating
It takes so long to get to my house
To take me out
Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the backseat
Bubble pop electric, bubble pop electric
Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the backseat
Bubble pop electric, uh-oh, in the backseat!
Okay, now
I understand he's on his way now
But jeez Louise, I mean today now?
I can't wait, I wanna play now (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm antsy
Bubble pop electric pansies
My sweet tooth, I want your candy
The Queen of Eng' would say it randy (Ha ha ha ha!)
I'm itchy
I wish you would come and scratch me
Tonight I'm fallin', won't you catch me?
Swoop on by so you can snatch me and take me out
(I'll get it!)
The need to be satisfied
(Hey Johnny! Lemme go grab my sweater)
Come pick me up, I want a ride
(Hi, Mrs. Stefani) (Bye, Mom!)
Hurry, hurry come to me
(So, baby, where you wanna go, huh?)
Drive-in movie
Drive in, move me
Drive into me
Bubble pop electric, you've gotta get it
Straight to me, drive-in movie
Take it to the backseat, run it like a track meet
Come to me, drive-in movie
(Bubble pop electric, you've gotta get it
Straight to me, drive-in movie)
Bubble pop electric
(Take it to the back seat, run it like a track meet)
(Come to me, drive-in movie)
Uh-oh, in the backseat!
Yeah, tell your father, I said hello!
Johnny, get outta here!

===== Gwen Stefani - Cool =====
It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I've found the love of my life
Passes, things get more comfortable
Everything is going right
And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
And we used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain
Remember Harbor Boulevard?
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown
We have changed, but we're still the same
Yeah, I know we're cool
And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hangin' out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
C-cool, uh-uh, I know we're cool, uh-uh
I-I know we're cool
C-cool, yeah, I know we're cool
Me and you

===== Gwen Stefani - Make Me Like You =====
I was fine 'fore I met you
I was broken but fine
I was lost and uncertain
But my heart was still mine
I was free 'fore I met you
I was broken but free
All alone in the clear view
But now you are all I see
Hey, wait a minute
No, you can't do this to me
Wait a minute
No, that's not fair
You're on me like jewelry
I really like you, but I'm so scared
Why'd you have to go and make me like you?
Yeah, this is a feeling I'm not used to
I'm so mad at you 'cause now you got me missing you
'Cause now you got me missing you
Something I could get used to
I could get used to this
It's getting harder to leave it
Your lips on my lips
Woah, I can't believe it
How good it could be
Didn't wanna believe it
Oh, God, thank God that I found you
Oh, God, 'cause now you got me missing you
Thank God
Thank God that I found you, oh
Now you got me missing you

===== Gwen Stefani - Baby Don't Lie =====
Uh-huh

That you can't, that you can't disguise, disguise (Oh)
Baby don't, baby don't, baby don't lie

Until you know, until you know, until you know why, know why
If we ever give up, then we're gonna die
Look me in the eye
Baby don't lie
We've been walkin' down this road for some time (Ooh)
And you love, and you love me good (Good), no lie (Ooh)

===== Gwen Stefani - What U Workin' With? =====
The way you walk in my hood
Like we’re feelin' so good
Here I am sayin' "My, my, my"
Walkin' over so fresh
Walking over so fly
All shine, all time
Just talkin' that truth
No fake
Easy when you walk this way
I’m talkin' that truth
Okay, hold up!
But enough about me
Let’s talk about you
Head down, all blue
You should be singin' like these
Yeah, somethin' like me
Make ’em go "Ooh, ooh, ooh"
I truly wouldn’t walk that way
Now we’re talkin' that truth
Okay
This is the moment when everybody’s in the light
So what you workin' with?
Drop that body like you’re tryna let them know
Twist that high, you know the bass is on the low
Take that feelin' like it’s somethin' that you stole
It ain’t about, ain’t about, it ain’t about what you're not
Ooh, whoa!
Show me, show me
What?
What you workin' with?
What, what, what you workin' with?
Keep runnin' that mouth
I don’t need a full round
I make 'em say Wow
Hit 'em’ like pow, pow, pow
A hundred thou'
Yeah, I’m talkin' that truth
So, What you workin' with?
(Work! Uh!)
Ooh, whoa! (Drop that body, body)
Ooh, whoa! (Take that feelin', feelin')
It ain’t about, ain’t about, it ain’t about what you're...

===== Gwen Stefani - Used To Love You =====
Never thought this would happen
Gotta let it sink in, you're gone
Don't know, know what I'm feeling
I must be dreaming, you're gone
Suitcase, band-aids
Pulling back out the driveway
You go, I'll stay
You can keep all the memories
I thought I was the best thing that ever happened to you
I thought you loved me the most
I don't know why I cry
But I think it's cause I remembered for the first time
Since I hated you
That I used to love you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I used to love you
You thought there were no boundaries
But you just pushed me too far
I guess nobody taught you
Nobody taught you how to love
You know I was the best thing that ever happened to you
Oh, now look at what you lost
Now look at what you lost, oh
I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't know why I used to love you

===== Gwen Stefani - 4 In The Morning =====
Waking up to find another day
The moon got lost again last night
But now the sun has finally had its say
I guess I feel alright
But it hurts when I think
When I let it sink in, it's all over me
I'm lying here in the dark
Watching you sleep, it hurts a lot
And all I know is
You've got to give me everything (Give me everything)
Nothing less 'cause you know I give you all of me (Give you all of me)
I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up
Stay up till four in the morning, and the tears are pouring
And I wanna make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right
All I wanted was to know I'm safe
Don't wanna lose the love I've found
Remember when you said that you would change?
Don't let me down
It's not fair how you are
I can't be complete, can you give me more?
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up (Give me everything)
Oh please, you know what I need (You know what I need)
Save all your love up for me
We can't escape the love
Give me everything that you have
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right (Give you all of me)
Give me everything
Give you all of me

===== Gwen Stefani - Wind It Up =====
High on the hill with the lonely goatherd
Lay-od-lay-od-lay-he-hoo
He yodelled back with the girl and goatherd
Lay-od-lay-od-low
Wind it up (Uh)
Wind it up (Uh, uh, uh)
Wind it up (Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh)
Yodellay, yodallay, yodel-low (Yeah)
This is the key that makes us wind up
When the beat comes on, the girls all line up
And the boys all look, but no, they can't touch
But the girls want to know why boys like us so much
They like way we dance, they like the way we work
They like the way that L.A.M.B. is going 'cross my shirt
They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape (She's crazy, right?)
They like the way we react every time we hear the—
Every time the bass bang, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up
(Get in line now)
(Uh, uh, uh) Wind it up (Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh)
Wind it up  (Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh) (C'mon) (Uh-uh)
Yodelay, yodelay, yodal-low
You've got to let the beat get under your skin
You've got to open up and let it all in
But see, once it gets in, the popping begins
Then you find out why all the boys stare
See, they're trying to bite our style
Trying to study our approach
They like the way we do it, so original
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room
This beat is for the clubs and cars that go
Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
(Uh, uh, uh) Wind it up (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
(Whenever you're ready) (Uh, uh)
Wind it up (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
(Uh-huh) This is your moment
(Uh-huh) Come on, girl, you know you own it
(Uh-huh) you know your key is still tick-tocking
(Hell yeah) But you know they're watching
Get it, girl, get it, get it, girl
To the front, to the side, to the back, but don't let him ride
Keep going, girl, it's your night
Don't let him steal your light
I know he thinks you're fine and stuff
But does he know how to wind you up? (C'mon)
Wind it up
Yodelay, yodelay, yodelay, hey!

===== Gwen Stefani - Let It Snow =====
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go (Nowhere to go)
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low (Way down low)
When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so (Love me so)
Zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo

===== Gwen Stefani - Jingle Bells =====
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight!
Oh jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way (Jingle, jingle)
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young

Two forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead
Jingle all the way
Jingle bells, jingle bells (Jingle, jingle)
Jing- jingle, jingle bells
Can't you hear those jingle bells?
She's dashing through the snow
Going to meet her baby by the mistletoe
Jing- jingle, jingle bells (Jingle, jingle)
We're laughing and we're loving
And we're kissing and we're hugging
As we jingle all the way

I'm still the original me, yeah (Hey)

===== Gwen Stefani - Misery =====
Where'd you go?
I got so used to being 'round you boy
I'm trying not to care, but where'd you go?
I'm doing my best to be sensible
I'm trying not to care, but
You're like drugs, you're like drugs to me

Drugs to me
So put me outta my misery
Hurry up, come see me
Put me outta my misery

===== Gwen Stefani - Sleigh Ride =====
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "Yoo-hoo"
Come on, it’s lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, let's go
Let's look at the show
We’re ridin' in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, it's grand
Just holding your hand
We're riding along with a song of a wintery fairyland
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy-cozy are we
We're snuggled up together likе two birds of a feather would be
Lеt's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
It’ll be the perfect ending to a perfect day
We’ll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop, pop, pop
There's a happy feeling nothing in this world can buy
When they pass around the chocholate and the pumpkin pie
It’ll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling, too

===== Gwen Stefani - Early Winter =====
You, you know how to get me so low
My heart had a crash when we spoke
I can't fix what you broke
And you, you always have a reason
Again and again, this feelin'
Why do I give in?
And I always was, and always was one for cryin'
I always was one for tears
The sun's getting cold, it's snowin'
Looks like an early winter for us
An early winter
Oh, I need you to turn me over
It's sad the map of the world is on you
The moon gravitates around you
The seasons escape you
No, I never was, and never was one for lyin'
You lied to me all these years
Why?
Why do you act so stupid?
You know that I'm always right
It looks like an early winter for us
It hurts and I can't remember sunlight
An early winter for us
The leaves are changing color for us
And it gets too much, yeah, it gets so much
Starting over, and over, and over again
(Well, it looks like an early winter for us)

===== Kelly Clarkson - Since U Been Gone =====
Here's the thing, we started out friends
It was cool, but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah
Since you been gone
You're dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long 'til I called you mine
And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I picture me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say
But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so movin' on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get what I want
How can I put it? You put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
How come I'd never hear you say, "I just wanna be with you"?
Guess you never felt that way
Now I get, I get what I want
You had your chance, you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
Again and again and again and again
Since you been gone (Since you been gone)
Thanks to you (Thanks to you)
Now I get (I get)
You should know (You should know)
That I get, I get what I want

===== Kelly Clarkson - Underneath the Tree =====
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree
Tonight (Tonight), I'm gonna hold you close (Ooh)
Make sure that you know (Know)
I was lost before you (Ooh)
Christmas was cold and grey (Ooh)
Another holiday (So alone)
Alone to celebrate
But then (But then), one day (One day)
Everything changed
You're all I need
I found (I found) what I was looking for (Ooh)
A love that's meant for me (Me)
A heart that's mine completely (Ooh)
Knocked me right off my feet (Ooh)
And this year I will fall (For you)
With no worries at all
'Cause you ('Cause you) are near (Are near)
And everything's clear
And then, one day, everything changed
Underneath the tree, yeah
You're here where you should be (Oh yeah)
Snow is falling as the carolers sing (Oh, yeah, yeah)
It just wasn't the same (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Presents, what a beautiful sight (Oh, you're all I need)

Underneath, underneath the tree, oh

===== Kelly Clarkson - Because of You =====
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you, I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh, every day of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
I am afraid
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep
(I watched you die, in your sleep)
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me
(I was too young for you to lean on me)
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain
(You never saw me, yeah, yeah)
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
I try my hardest just to forget everything
I don't know how to let anyone else in
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
Because of you (Ah-ah, ah, ah)
Because of you, mmh, ooh

===== Kelly Clarkson - Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You) =====
You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone (Sleepin' here alone)
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want (Do the things I want)
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'll come running back
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on and over you
You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You tried to break me, but you see
Thanks to you, I got a new thing started
Thanks to you, I'm not the broken-hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me
You know in the end, the day you left was just my beginning
In the end
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone (What doesn't kill you)
Just me, myself, and I (What doesn't kill you)
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger (Stronger)
Stand a little taller (Taller)
When I'm alone

===== Kelly Clarkson - Heartbeat Song =====
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
You, where the hell did you come from?
You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb
Now I've got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun
I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a long time
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Oh, up, up all night long (All night long)
I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would've had a doubt
If I'd have known where I'd be now
Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
Oh, I could do this for a long time
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long
Until tonight, I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I've ever breathed without you
Baby, you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time (One more time)

===== Kelly Clarkson - Breakaway =====
Da-da-da, un, da-da
Da-da-da, un, da-da-da-da
Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreamin' of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray)
I could break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And break away
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane
Far away (I will)
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
Take a risk, take a chance, make a change
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging 'round revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, break away
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
Out of the darkness and into the sun (Into the sun)
But I won't forget of the place I come from
Break away

===== Kelly Clarkson - My Life Would Suck Without You =====
Guess this means you're sorry
You're standin' at my door
Guess this means you take back
All you said before
Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again
'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck)
Without you
Maybe I was stupid
For tellin' you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for
Tryna pick a fight
I know that I've got issues
But you're pretty messed up too
Either way I found out
I'm nothin' without you
Being with you
Is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you
But I can't let you go, oh yeah
'Cause we belong together now, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Without you, yeah
'Cause we belong together now, yeah (Together now)

===== Kelly Clarkson - Santa, Can’t You Hear Me =====
Keep the snow and sleigh rides
Keep those silver bells
Keep the gifts beneath the tree
Give them to someone else
Keep that magic snowman
Keep those twinkly lights
Keep the reindeer
My heart already knows how to fly (Mm)
'Cause all I ever wanted
Was nothin’ I got and
Santa, can't you hear me?
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
I don't need a thing
I sent a letter to you, ooh, ooh
On how to make my dreams come true, yeah, yeah
What I want for Christmas
Hasn’t come and I been so blue
Tell me what can I do? Ooh, ooh, oh yeah
Keep the mistlеtoe (Keep the mistletoе)
Unless below, is what I need (What I need)
Keep those bows and boxes (Keep them bows and them boxes)
Keep those three wise men
No need for a North star to show me where I will end
Isn't on a shelf and
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh (Ooh yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh)
On how to make my dreams come true, oh-woah
Hasn't come and I been so blue
Keep the mistletoe
Unless below, is what I need
Oh, Santa, can't you hear me? (Yeah)
’Cause all I ever wanted
Was nothing I got and
Santa, can’t you hear me?
There's one thing that I need
Oh-oh, oh, oh (Ooh yeah)
Oh, oh (Ooh yeah)
Oh, oh (Santa, baby)
I don’t need a thing
I sent a letter to you, ooh, ooh (You, ooh, ooh)
Unless below, is what I need, oh

===== Kelly Clarkson - Broken & Beautiful =====
I never held my hand out and asked for something free
I got pride I could roll out for miles in front of me
I don't need your help, and I don’t need sympathy
I don't need you to lower the bar for me
I know I'm Superwoman, I know I’m strong
I know I've got this 'cause I've had it all along
I'm phenomenal and I'm enough
I don't need you to tell me who to be
Can someone just hold me?
Don't fix me, don’t try to change a thing
Can someone just know me?
’Cause underneath, I'm broken and it’s beautiful
I'm broken and it's beautiful
I'm broken and it’s beautiful
Walking on the ocean, turning water into wine
We bury our emotion and pretend that we're just fine
The only way to live now is to know you're gonna fly
Don't listen to the lying liars and their lies
I know I'm Superwoman, I know I'm strong
Don't fix me, don't try to change a thing
'Cause underneath, I'm broken and it's beautiful
Hey, I'm broken and it's beautiful
I'm tired (Oh)
Can I just be tired? (Just be tired)
Without piling on all sad and scared and out of time (Oh)
I'm wild (Wild)
Can I just be wild? (Just be wild)
Without feeling like I'm failing and I'm losing my mind
Oh, someone just know me
It's beautiful, it's beautiful (It's beautiful)
It's beautiful, I'm broken and it's beautiful

===== Kelly Clarkson - Behind These Hazel Eyes =====
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore

===== Kelly Clarkson - Piece by Piece =====
And all I remember is your back
Walkin' towards the airport, leavin' us all in your past
I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
Begged you to want me, but you didn't want to (Ah)
But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
Piece by piece, he filled the holes
That you burned in me at six years old
And you know
He never walks away, he never asks for money
He takes care of me, he loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could
Stay
And all of your words fall flat
I made somethin' of myself and now you wanna come back
But your love, it isn't free, it has to be earned (Ah)
Back then I didn’t have anything you needed, so I was worthless (Ah)
He takes care of me, 'cause he loves me
That a man can be kind and a father could stay
Piece by piece
Piece by piece, I fell far from the tree
I will never leave her like you left me
And she will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you, I'm gonna put her first
He'll never walk away, he'll never break her heart
He'll take care of things, he'll love her
That a man can be kind and a father should be great

===== Kelly Clarkson - Love So Soft =====
Hey
Every kiss is a door
Can I knock on yours? Can we knock a little more?
If your touch is a key
Keep on twistin', keep unlockin', keep on turnin' me
Let me in
I wanna be closer to you, let you under my skin
If I let you in
You gotta be careful with it
Let me tell you again (Hey)
Love so soft, you ain't had nothin' softer
Break it, then you buy it, and it sure gonna cost ya
Love so soft that you can't rub off
You gon' love it, if you try it
Got you hooked, now you're caught up
Love so soft, so soft (So soft)
If a thought was the truth
We'd be doin' all the kinds of things I know you wanna do
But I need, need to know (Need to know)
Will you protect me, respect me if I let you close?
Let (Oh, let) me in (Let me in, let me in)
If I let (If I let) you in (Let you in, let you in)
If you want this love, gotta hold it tight
Never let it go, baby, let it give you life (Give you life)
Never let it go, baby, let it give you life
Break it, then you buy it, and it sure gonna cost ya (You ain't had, you ain't had it)
You gon' love it if you try it
If you want this love (If you want), gotta hold it tight (If you want)
(Love so soft) Love so soft
(Love so soft) Oh
Never let it go, baby
C'mon love, c'mon, c'mon love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
If you want it baby
(Love so soft, so soft, yeah)

===== Kelly Clarkson - Under The Mistletoe =====
Every time I look around this room
My eyes they tend to fall on you and I confess
Nothing but you makes sense
Memories fill my heart and I can barely keep my tears
From fallin', oh I want your love
Do you ever think of us?
Is it too late, too late, to open up?
I'm dyin' to say, oh how I love you
You're walkin' towards me now
What am I gonna say?
Push my pride aside
When I close my eyes
It's just you and I
Here under the mistletoe
Magic fills the air
Standin' over there
Santa hear my prayer
Hеre under the mistlеtoe
All I want, hey, yeah
All I want, hey-hey, yeah
Is under the mistletoe
Oh everything I try to keep you from gettin' inside
Works until I see your face
I linger hopin' you might stay
Wrapped up in your arms, is where
I wanna spend my nights so hard, how much I want you
Do you think of us?
How I want your love
Is it too late, too late
To let you know, I can't quite escape
How much I need you
All I want, hey, yeah (All I really, really ever want)
All I want, hey-hey, yeah (All I really, really ever want)
Won't you read my mind somehow (Oh, oh, oh)
Meet me in the middle, underneath a little bit of mistletoe
And indecision take a breath as I
Standin' over there (Standin' over there)
'Cause all I want, hey, yeah (All I really, really ever want)
Is under the mistletoe (Is under the mistletoe)
Push my pride aside, aside, aside
It's just you and I (It's just you and I, haha)
All I want (I'm pushin' my pride aside, aside, aside), all I want (Baby it's just you and I)
Is you (Oh it's only you), is you
Oh, oh, oh, oh woah

===== Kelly Clarkson - Wrapped in Red =====
Everybody's happy, snow is falling down
Prayers are being answered, miracles all around
From afar I've loved you, but never let it show
And every year, another December comes and goes
Always watching
Never reaching
But this Christmas, I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas, I'm not afraid to fall
So I'm at your door with nothing more than words I've never said
In all this white, you'll see me like you've never seen me yet
Wrapped in red, ooh
Blue is where I've been, green can't buy me you
Silver bells remind me that mistletoe's for two
So I found a color that only tells the truth
That paints a picture of how I feel for you
Oh, oh, this Christmas, I'm gonna risk it all
This Christmas, Im not afraid to fall
I'll never feel you
If I don't tell you
This Christmas, I'm gonna risk it all

===== Kelly Clarkson - Catch My Breath =====
I don't wanna be left behind
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life
Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now
Addicted to the love I found
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith, karma comes around
I will spend the rest of my life
You helped me see
The beauty in everything
(Catch my breath) Catch my breath
It's all so simple now
Catch my breath (Catch my breath) Catch my breath

===== Kelly Clarkson - Already Gone =====
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye
Even with our fists held high
It never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die
I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you, now I can't stop
I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone
Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
It started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
"Perfect" couldn't keep this love alive
You know that I love you so, I
Love you enough to let you go
I'm already gone, already gone
You can't make it feel right when you know that it's wrong
There's no moving on, so I'm already gone
Ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone (Ooh, oh)
Ahh, already gone, already gone, already gone, yeah
There's no moving on

===== Kelly Clarkson - A Moment Like This =====
What if I told you it was all meant to be?
Would you believe me? Would you agree?
It's almost that feeling that we've met before
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy
When I tell you love has come here and now
A moment like this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh, I can't believe it's happening to me
Everything changes, but beauty remains
Something so tender, I can't explain
Well, I may be dreamin', but 'til I awake
Can we make this dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love we share
Could this be the greatest love of all?
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall (Fall)
So let me tell you this
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment
Like this
Oh, like this (A moment like)
Oh, like this

===== Kelly Clarkson - Never Enough =====
I'm tryin' to hold my breath
Let it stay this way
Can't let this moment end
You set off a dream in me
Getting louder now
Can you hear it echoing?
Take my hand
Will you share this with me?
'Cause darling, without you
All the shine of a thousand spotlights
All the stars we steal from the night sky
Will never be enough, never be enough
Towers of gold are still too little
These hands could hold the world, but it'll
Never be enough, never be enough for me
Never, never
Never, for me, for me
Never enough, never enough, never enough
For me, for me, for me
Never enough, never, never
Never enough
For me

===== Kelly Clarkson - Miss Independent =====
Miss independent
Miss self-sufficient
Miss keep your distance, mmm
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
Said, ooh, she fell in love
What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true
Misguided heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection
She fell in love
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Open this door)
Surprise, it's time (Yeah)
To feel what's real, what's real
What happened to Miss Independent? (Oh)
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you (Old you)
When love, when love is true
When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of "Why can't that be me?"
I'm so glad I finally see
What is this feelin' taking over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Oh yeah)
Surprise (Surprise), it's time (Yeah)
To feel (To feel) what's real
No longer need to be defensive (Yeah)
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you
Miss Independent

===== Cyndi Lauper - Time After Time =====
Lyin' in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after
Sometimes you picture me, I'm walkin' too far ahead
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
If you fall, I will catch you, (I'll be waiting) I will be waiting
After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watchin' through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
You say, "Go slow," I fall behind
If you fall, I will catch you, (I will be waiting) I will be waiting
Time

===== Cyndi Lauper - True Colors =====
You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh, I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small
But I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors
Are beautiful like a rainbow
Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy
Can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there
And I'll see your true colors
Can't remember when I last saw you laugh
You've taken all you can bear
True colors are shining through

===== Cyndi Lauper - All Through the Night =====
All through the night
I'll be awake, and I'll be with you
This precious time when time is new
Oh, all through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same without saying
We have no past, we won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start the meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends, there is no end
Stray cat is crying, so stray cat sings back
They have forgotten what binding they lack
Oh, under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see
Oh, the sleep in your eyes is enough
Let me be there, let me stay there awhile

===== Cyndi Lauper - I Drove All Night =====
I had to escape
The city was sticky and cruel
Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming while I drove
The long straight road ahead, I
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside
I drove all night to get to you
Is that all right?
I drove all night
Crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep
To make love to you
What in this world
Keeps us from tearing apart?
No matter where I go I hear
The beating of your heart
I think about you
When the night is cold and da-ah-ark
No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases the feeling between me and you
Taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
I drove all night...

===== Cyndi Lauper - The Goonies 'R' Good Enough =====
Here we are hanging onto strains of greed and blues
Break the chain then we break down
Oh, it's not real if you don't feel it
Unspoken expectations
Ideals you used to play with
They've finally taken shape
What's good enough (good enough)
For you it's good enough (good enough)
For me it's good enough (good enough)
It's good enough for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now you'll say you're startin' to feel the push and pull
Of what could be and never can
You mirror me, stumblin' through those
Old fashioned superstitions
I find it too hard to break
Oh, maybe you're out of place
Good enough (good enough)
For me it's good, it's good enough (good enough)
(Good enough for you it's)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh
(Good enough for me it's)
Ah-ha
(Good enough)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

===== Cyndi Lauper - She Bop =====
Well, I see 'em every night in tight blue jeans
In the pages of a Blueboy magazine
Hey, I've been thinking of a new sensation
I'm picking up the good vibrations
Oop, she bop, she bop
Do I wanna go out with a lion's roar?
Yeah, I wanna go south and get me some more
Hey, they say that a stitch in time saves nine
They say I better stop or I'll go blind
She bop, he bop, a we bop
I bop, you bop, a they bop
Be bop, be bop, a lu bop
(I hope He will understand)
Be bop, be bop, a lu, she bop
Oh, she do, she bop
Hey, hey they say I better get a chaperone
Because I can't stop messing with the danger zone
I won't worry, and I won't fret
Ain't no law against it yet

===== Cyndi Lauper - Money Changes Everything =====
I said, "I'm sorry, baby, I'm leaving you tonight
I found someone new, he's waiting in the car outside"
"Aw, honey, how could you do it?
We swore each other everlasting love"
I said, "Well, yeah, I know, but when we did
There was one thing we weren't thinking of, and that's money"
Money changes everything
I said money, money changes everything
We think we know what we're doing, that don't mean a thing
It's all in the past now, money changes everything
They shake your hand and they smile, and they buy you a drink
They say, "We'll be your friends, we'll stick with you 'til the end"
Ah, but everybody's only
Looking out for themselves
And you say, "Well, who can you trust?"
I'll tell you, it's just nobody else, it's money
You think you know what you're doing, we don't pull the strings
Yeah, yeah, yeah, money, money changes everything
We think we know what we're doing, we don't know a thing
Hey, yeah, yeah
Money is everything, yes
Money changes everything, yeah
Money is everything
Money changes everything, yeah, yeah
Money, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

===== Cyndi Lauper - Change of Heart =====
Here I am
Just like I said I would be
I'm your friend
Just like you think it should be
Did you think I would stand here and lie?
While our moment was passing us by
Oh, while I'm here
Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat to turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around (Turn it around)
Days go by
Leaving me with a hunger
I could fly
Back to when we were younger
When adventures like cars we would ride
And the years lied ahead still untried
While I stand here
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Turn it around, 'round, around, yeah
Turn it around, 'round, around (Turn it around)
Turn it, turn it, turn it around (Turn it around)
Blind leading blind
Never feel the laughter
Search through time
Nothing reveals the answer
If it's truth that you're looking to find
It is nowhere outside of your mind
While I bide my time
Just turn it around
Please turn it around
Turn it around, around, around, yeah
Turn it around, around, around (Turn it around)
Turn it, turn it, turn it around, around, around (Turn it around)
And I'm waiting for your change of heart (Ooh)

===== Cyndi Lauper - When You Were Mine =====
When you were mine
I gave you all of my money
Time after time, huh
You done me wrong
Just like a train
Let all my friends come over and eat
You were so strange
You didn't have the decency to change the sheets
Oh, when you were mine
Used to let you wear all of my clothes
You were so fine
Hah, baby, that's the reason that it hurt me so
I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (Don't care)
'Cause I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did when you were mine
You were kinda sorta my best friend
So, I was blind
I let you fool around
I never cared
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When you was there
Sleeping in between the two of us
Aah, ha-ha-hey, yeah
You were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time
Following him whenever he's with you
'Cause I love you, baby, that's no lie, oh
Oh, I love you more than I did when you were mine
Ooh-oh
Ooh-oh-uh-oh
I love you more, I love you more when you were mine
I love you more, I love you more, I love you more, I love you more
I love you more when you were mine

===== Cyndi Lauper - Iko Iko =====
My grandma and your grandma were sittin' by the fire
My grandma told your grandma, "I'm gonna set your flag on fire"
Talk-in' 'bout
Hey now, hey now
Iko-iko, un-day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-ne
Jock-a-mo fee-na-ne
Look at my king all dressed in red
Iko, iko, un-day
Bet-cha five dollars he'll kill you dead
Jock-a-mo fee na-ne
Iko-iko, un day
Yeah
See that man all dressed in green
He ain't a man, he's a lovin' machine
My flag boy and your flag boy were sittin' by the fire
With your flag boy told and my flag boy
I'm gonna set their flags on fire
Talkin' 'bout
Hey now

===== Cyndi Lauper - Walkin' After Midnight =====
I go out walkin’ after midnight
Out in the moonlight just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight searchin' for you
I walk for miles along the highway
Well that's just my way of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin’ after midnight, searchin' for you
I stop and see a weepin' willow
Cryin' on his pillow, maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the sky turns gloomy
Night winds whisper to me, I'm lonesome as I can be
Out in the starlight, just hopin' you may be
Somewhere out walkin’ after midnight, searchin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Searchin' for me

===== Cyndi Lauper - The World Is Stone =====
It's no trick of the light
It's hard on the soul
Stone the world is stone
Cold to the touch
And hard on the soul
In the grey of the streets
In the neon unknown
I look for a sign
That I'm not on my own
That I'm not here alone
As the still of the night
And the choke of the air
And the winners delight
And the losers despair
Closes in left and right
I would love not to care
Stone, the world is stone
From the far away look
Without stars in my eyes
Through the halls of the rich
And the flats of the poor
Wherever I go
There's no warmth anymore
There's no love anymore
"There's no love anymore"
So I turn on my heels
I'm declining the fall
I've had all I can take
With my back to the wall
Tell the world I'm not in
I'm not taking the call
But I saw it once
With the stars in my eyes
When each colour rang out
In a thunderous chrome
I can't find my way home
In a world made of stone

===== Cyndi Lauper - My First Night Without You =====
I'm driving home from work
Knowing you're not there
I used to hurry home
Now I don't even care
The sun is in my eyes, so I can't see
But when it sets down behind the mountain it's gonna be
My first night without you
My first night without you, oh
Oh, without you
I sit here like a fool
Remembering everything
The way we used to talk
The songs that we used to sing
I gotta to try and leave the past behind
But my memory's so good
I think that I'm losing my mind
And I wonder what I'll do, oh
Will I be able to sleep?
Will I lie in my bed and weep?
What if I forget and reach for you?
Will I dream about you?
My first night, my first night
My first night without you...

===== Cyndi Lauper - Into the Nightlife =====
Got this endless itch to ride
Into the night
Fortune cookie says I'm right
Kung Fu-like
Shake your body, mister
Gonna make ya body blister
Say hey hey hey
Don't wanna have to make you
I don't wanna have to shake you down
Hey Hey Hey
I'll take you 'til you all spun up
Pitter, patter, doesn't matter what you got
And in love, into the nightlife
Turn you over baby 'til its never enough
And in love, into the night
Like love, into the nightlife
Want to dress for you tonight
Under the light
Shot up like a satellite
Shake ya money maker
I will never be a faker now, hey hey hey
Leave them standing, waiting
Till they're practically fainting now, hey hey hey
I'll take ya 'til you all spun up
Shirtless wonders wreck my sight

===== Cyndi Lauper - Who Let In The Rain =====
Things like this
Can always take a little time
I always thought
We'd be together down the line
We start to fight
And can't get over what was said
'Cause you see black and white
And I see red
And I wonder who let in the rain
You know without you
I'm not the same
When love gets strong
People get weak
Sometimes they lose control
And wind up in too deep
They fall like rain
Who let in the rain?
I make the bed and cover
Where you used to sleep
I'm smoothing over promises
Made in these sheets
I envy lovers passing by
Out on the street
'Cause what they have
I couldn't keep
They fall like rain (Fall like rain)
Who let in this rain?
Who let in the rain, ah-ha
(Who let in the, who let in the, who let in the)
(Who let in, who let in, who let in the rain?)
Who let in the rain, who let in the rain?
Who let in the, who let in the, who let in the, who let in the
Who let in the rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain?

===== Cyndi Lauper - Early Christmas Morning =====
Watch them dancing all 'round the Christmas tree ...
Waiting for the opening
Early Christmas morning ...
All around the world is sleeping
Little children there's no peeping
Wait and see what Santa's bringing
Icicles and breakfast cakes ...
Friends and family we will celebrate
Sounds that joy and laughter make
All around and far off places
Angels waken smiling faces
Wrapping us with love and graces
Christmas's come!
Listen to the children sing
Christmas, Christmas morning
Yeah, joy to the world!
Do you hear the children singing?
Singing...Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Yeah, Christmas morning
Christmas Morning...

===== Cyndi Lauper - What's Going On =====
Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
And brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know you've got to find a way
To bring back love here today
Father, father
There's no need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring back lovin' here today
Picket lines (Brother)
And picket signs (Brother)
Don't punish me (Brother)
With brutality (Brother)
Just talk to me (Brother)
So you can see
Ah, what's going on
What's going on
What's going on, yeah
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Who are they to judge us
Just because our hair is long?
To bring back understanding today
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ha
To bring back some lovin' here today
Picket lines (Sister)
And picket signs (Sister)
Don't punish me (Sister)
With brutality (Sister)
Now just talk to me (Sister)
Oh, what's going on
Tell me, what's going on?
Yeah, yeah
You tell me, I'll tell you
What's going on, ah
Father, father, yeah
I'll tell you what's going on
You tell me what's going on, ah
There's too many of you dying...

===== Cyndi Lauper - Christmas Conga =====
Let's hang the streamers from the ceiling
Bring out the old cheer
Ring in the new year
And get that Christmas feeling
I wish you joy that never ends
Happy times with all your friends
Come on and hold my hips a little longer
As we do the Christmas Conga
Bonga, bonga, bonga, bonga
Do the Christmas Conga
The old white tree still looks good
And Grandma's angels got me thinking
String up the new lights
Brighten the cold nights
And get those baubles blinking
And then we'll put on party hats
As the year comes to a conclusion
Turn on the yule log
Spike up the egg nog
And break those resolutions

===== Cyndi Lauper - Hard Candy Christmas =====

===== Ed Sheeran - Perfect =====
I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darlin', you look perfect tonight"
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight
No, no, no
Mm, no, no
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight

===== Ed Sheeran - Photograph =====
Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Mm, we keep this love in this photograph
Hearts were never broken
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Oh, you can fit me
Inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearin' you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"

===== Ed Sheeran - Thinking out Loud =====
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinkin' 'bout how
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That, baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh
Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo
Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, love
So baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
And kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh, darlin'
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

===== Ed Sheeran - I Don't Care =====
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (No)
I don't like nobody but you, it's like you're the only one here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, I don't care
I don't like nobody but you, I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, yeah
'Cause I don't care (Don't care)
When I'm with my baby, yeah (Oh yeah)
All the bad things disappear (Disappear)
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody (Maybe I'm somebody)
I can deal with the bad nights (With the bad nights)
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near (Me near)
You can take me anywhere (Anywhere, anywhere)
(I'm loved by somebody, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I'm with my baby, yeah (Ooh)

===== Ed Sheeran - Bad Habits =====
(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out, now

===== Ed Sheeran - Shivers =====
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Mmm, you got me feelin' like
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver-er-er
You know you make me shiver
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back (Oh, no)
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back, hey

===== Ed Sheeran - Beautiful People =====
We are, we are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)
L.A., mmm
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
We are not beautiful, yeah

===== Ed Sheeran - Castle on the Hill =====
When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers

===== Ed Sheeran - Galway Girl =====
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl (Hey)

===== Ed Sheeran - Happier =====
Walkin' down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new
'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it, too
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursin' an empty bottle and tellin' myself
You're happier, aren't you? (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you (Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah)
But, my darlin', I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
I could try to smile to hide the truth
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waitin' here for you

===== Ed Sheeran - I See Fire =====
Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Callin' out, Father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside (High)
And if we should die tonight, then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Callin' out, Father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire inside the mountain
And I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
Oh, should my people fall, then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Callin' out, Father, oh, hold fast and we will
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as the sky is fallin' down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screamin' out
I see fire (Oh, you know I saw a city burnin' out), fire
And I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin, yeah), fire
And I see fire (Ooh), fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side

===== Ed Sheeran - Perfect Duet =====
I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes
Well, baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
Ah, no, no, no
Ah-ah-oh
Oh, barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now, I know I have met an angel in person
And she (He) looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight

===== Ed Sheeran - South of the Border =====
She got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the mmm, white dress, but when she’s wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing
I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I’m gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That he really wants to know my name, hey
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same
I love his lips 'cause he says the words
Don’t wake up, this love is like a dream
So join me in this bed that I’m in
So I'm gonna put my time in (Time in)
And won’t stop until the angels sing
Come south of the border with me (Rrrat)
Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Bardi, uh
You never live 'til you risk your life (Life)
You wanna shine, you gotta get more ice (Ice, ice, oh)
Am I your lover or I’m just your vice? (Woo, yeah, yeah)
A little crazy, but I'm just your type (Okurrr)
You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs
And the diamonds I prefer, in my closet, his and hers, ayy
He want the lil' mamacita, margarita (Margarita)
I think that Ed got a lil' jungle fever, ayy (Woo!)
You are more than (You are more than)
Something borin' (Something borin')
Legs open, tongue out, Michael Jordan, uh (Uh)
Go explore in (Woo, woo) somethin' foreign (Skrrt, skrrt)
Bust it up, a rain forest, it be pourin', yeah
Kiss me like you need me, rub me like a genie
Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini
'Cause you gotta see me, never leave me (Never leave me)
You got a girl that could finally do it all
Drop a album, drop a baby, but I never drop the ball, uh
So join me in this bed (This bed) that I'm in (That I'm in)
Push up on me and sweat, darling (Oh no, no, no)
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing (Nah, nah, nah)
Come south of the border, border (Hey)
Come south of the border, border

===== Ed Sheeran - Don't =====
I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her, "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'

===== Ed Sheeran - Supermarket Flowers =====
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get-well-soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But, Mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
(Ooh)
Hallelujah
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"

===== Ed Sheeran - Dive =====
Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Oh, baby, I apologise for it
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
So don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mm
And lie awake every day
Don't know how much I can take
Mm, I could fall or I could fly
Sittin' back, lookin' at
Every mess that I made
And let me know the truth
And before I dive right into you

===== Ed Sheeran - Tenerife Sea =====
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
Should this be the last thing I see?
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
So in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me
So in love, love, love, love
And in a moment, I knew you, Beth

===== Ed Sheeran - Lego House =====
I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a LEGO house
If things go wrong, we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings, but there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you, mh
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I will mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
I think I love you better now, now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it, and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it, but I've been here before
Now, I'll surrender up my heart, and swap it for yours
Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take
If you're broken, I'll mend ya
I will love you better now

===== Amy Winehouse - Valerie (BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge) =====
Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head, I paint a picture
Since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie, yeah
Valerie
Did you have to go to jail?
Put your house on up for sale?
Did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan
I hope you'll find the right man
Who'll fix it for ya
And are you shoppin' anywhere?
Changed the colour of your hair?
And are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
That you were dodgin' all the time?
Are you still dizzy?
Oh, Valerie
Oh, Valerie, yeah, Valerie, yeah

===== Amy Winehouse - Rehab =====
They tried to make me go to rehab, but I said, "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab, but I won't go, go, go
I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass
The man said "Why do you think you here?"
I said, "I got no idea"
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said, "I just think you're depressed"
This, me: "Yeah, baby, and the rest"
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said, "No, no, no"
I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, ooh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend
It's not just my pride
It's just till these tears have dried

===== Amy Winehouse - You Know I'm No Good =====
Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
Your rolled-up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good
Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinkin' on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet ya, chips and pita
You say, "When we married", 'cause you're not bitter
"There'll be none of him no more"
I cried for you on the kitchen floor
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soap my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drop and my guts churn
You shrug, and it's the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first?
Yeah, you know that I'm no good

===== Amy Winehouse - Tears Dry On Their Own =====
All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew
And this regret I've got accustomed to
Once it was so right, when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
And you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity
He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)
And in your way, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
I don't understand, why do I stress the man?
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men
So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze
He takes the day, but I'm grown
I wish I could say no regrets
And no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see
And in your way, my blue shade
Woah, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day, but I am grown
And in your way, my deep shade
My tears dry on their own, woah
My tears dry

===== Amy Winehouse - Love Is A Losing Game =====
For you, I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five-story fire as you came
One I wished I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Self-professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods

===== Amy Winehouse - Me & Mr Jones =====
Nobody stands in between me and my man
It's me and Mr. Jones
(Me and Mr. Jones)
What kind of fuckery is this?
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig (Oh, Slick Rick)
And thought I didn't love you when I did (When I did)
Can't believe you played me out like that
No, you ain't worth guest list
Plus one of all them girls you kiss (All them girls)
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (To yourself)
Can't believe you played yourself (Out) like this
Rulers one thing, but come Brixton
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones
What kind of fuckery are we?
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (Dick to me)
I might let you make it up to me (Make it up)
Who's playing Saturday?
What kind of fuckery are you?
Side from Sammy you're my best black Jew (Best black Jew)
But I could swear that we were through (We were through)
I still wonder 'bout the things you do
Mr. Destiny, 9 and 14
Mr. Jones (Me and Mr. Jones)
Me and, oh

===== Amy Winehouse - Stronger Than Me =====
You should be stronger than me
You been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always wanna talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my ladyboy
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do, are you gay?
He said, "The respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learn"
I said, "You don't know what love is, get a grip
Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script"
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime
I've forgotten all of young love's joy

===== Amy Winehouse - He Can Only Hold Her =====
Woah, ooh
Oh, oh-oh, woah
Oh
He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on, but no one's home
She's so vacant, her soul is taken
He thinks, "What's she running from?"
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
Because what's inside her never dies
Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses, the man she misses
The man that he longs to be
Because what's inside her, it never dies
But what's inside her never dies

===== Amy Winehouse - Our Day Will Come =====
Our day will come (Our day will come)
And we'll have everything
We'll share the joy (We'll share the joy)
Falling in love can bring
No one can tell me
That I'm too young to know (Young to know)
I love you so (Love you so)
And you love me
If we just wait a while
No tears for us (No tears for us)
Think love and wear a smile
Our dreams have magic
Because we'll always stay in love this way
Our day will come
(Our day will come, our day will come)

===== Amy Winehouse - Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow? (2011) =====
Tonight, you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight, the light of love is in your eyes
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Is this a lasting treasure?
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow? Yeah
Tonight, with words unspoken
And you said that I'm the only one, the only one, yeah
But will my heart be broken
When the night (When the night) meets (Meets the morning) the morning star?
I'd like to know that your love is love I can be sure of, ooh, yeah
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
(Will you still love me tomorrow?)
Will you still love me tomorrow? Ooh
(Will you still love me?)

===== Amy Winehouse - Wake Up Alone =====
It's okay in the day, I'm staying busy
Tied up enough, so I don't have to wonder, "Where is he?"
Got so sick of crying, so just lately
When I catch myself, I do a 180
I stay up, clean the house, at least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content that everyone gets
Just disappears soon as the sun sets
He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floods me with dread
Soaked in sorrow, he swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
As far as my heart, I'd rather be restless
Second I stop, the sleep catches up and I'm breathless
'Cause this ache in my chest, 'cause my day is done now
The dark covers me and I cannot run now
My blood running cold, I stand before him (Before him)
It's all I can do to assure him (Assure him)
When he comes to me, I drip for him tonight
Drowning me, we bathe under blue light (Under blue)

===== Amy Winehouse - Fuck Me Pumps =====
Woo
When you walk in the bar
And you're dressed like a star
Rockin' your "eff me" pumps
And a man notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's looking to
'Cause you all look the same, everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night, 'cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer’s wife
You don't like players
That's what you say
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller
You're more than a fan lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night stands
He could be your whole life if you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning, you're vexed
He's on to the next
And you didn't even get no text
Don't be too upset if they call you a sket
'Cause like the news, every day, you get pressed
All them big ballers
Don't do nothing for ya
You can't sit down right, 'cause your jeans are too tight
And you lucky it's ladies' night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breast cost more than hers
So you did Miami, 'cause you got there for free
But, somehow, you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody and spent the night getting caned
Without girls like you, there'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you, there's no night life
All those men just go home to their wives
Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped
So dust off your "fuck me" pumps

===== Amy Winehouse - Some Unholy War =====
If my man was fightin' some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him with strength
He didn't know, it's you I'm fightin' for
He can't lose with me in tow (With me in tow)
I refuse to let him go (To let him go)
At his side and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow
We put it in writin', but who you writin' for?
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done, recitin', my stomach standin' still
Like you're readin' my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say (Scars say)
And I'll battle 'til this bitter finale (Bitter finale)
Just me, my dignity
And this guitar case, woah, woah
Yes, yes, my man's fightin' some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
But who you dyin' for?
B, I would have died, too, I'd  like to
Yeah, if my man was fightin'

===== Amy Winehouse - The Girl From Ipanema =====
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes each one she passes
Goes laboo-du-di-daa
When she walks, it's just like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes
Oh, how I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I go
The girl, the girl, the girl
From Ipanema, from Ipanema
Oh, how I want her so badly
How, how can I tell her I love her
And when she passes, I smile
But she doesn't see
She ain't looking at me

===== Amy Winehouse - Cupid =====
Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
I don't want to bother you
But I'm in distress
There's danger of me losin' all my happiness
For I love a man who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix, so
Now if your arrow makes his love strong for me
I swear I'm going to love him 'til eternity
I know that, 'tween the both of us, his heart we can steal
Cupid, help me if you will, so
Yeah, Cupid
Oh, oh, Cupid, yeah
Oh, Cupid

===== Amy Winehouse - What Is It About Men =====
Understand, once he was a family man
So surely I would never, ever go through it firsthand
Emulate all the shit my mother hates
I can't help but demonstrate my Freudian fate
My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself, it fails to die
And animal aggression is my downfall
I don't care about what you got, I want it all
It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again, "What is it 'bout men?"
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again, "What is it 'bout men?
What is it 'bout men?"
I'm nurturing, I just wanna do my thing
And I'll take the wrong man as naturally as I sing
And I'll save my tears for uncovering my fears
Our behavioural patterns that stick over the years
'Cause it's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
Now my destructive side has grown a mile wide
Ooh, it's bricked up in my head and it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again "What is it 'bout men?

===== Amy Winehouse - Addicted =====
Tell your boyfriend, next time he around
To buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down
I wouldn't care if brave would give me some more
I'd rather him leave you then leave him my dro
When you smoke all my weed, man
You gots to call the green man
So I can get mine
And you get yours
Once is enough to make me attack
So bring me a bag and your man can come back
I'll check him at the door, make sure he got green
I'm tighter than airport security teams
I'm my own man
So when will you learn
That you got a man but I gots to burn?
Don't make no difference if I end up alone
I'd rather have myself and smoke my home grown
Oh, it's got me addicted
Does more than any dick did
Yeah, I can get mine
Hey, I can get mine

===== Amy Winehouse - Just Friends =====
When will we get the time to be just friends?
It's never safe for us, not even in the evening
'Cause I've been drinking
Not in the morning where your shit works
It's always dangerous when everybody's sleeping
And I've been thinking
"Can we be alone?
Can we be alone?"
And, no, I'm not ashamed but the guilt will kill you
If she don't first
I'll never love you like her
Though we need to find the time to just do this shit together
For it gets worse
I wanna touch you, but that just hurts
When will we get the time to be just, just friends?
When will we get the time to be just friends, just friends?
Just friends?

===== Amy Winehouse - Half Time =====
Simple, sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I can't help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you won’t get the chance
Halftime, time to think it through
Consider the change
Seek it from a different view
Rhythm floods my heart
The melody, it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole
You should thank your lucky stars
'Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with uplift
My lyrics revealing some natural vibe
It's a kind of laid-back feeling
Oh, just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take, yeah
So, I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache, yeah

===== Billie Eilish - lovely =====
Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Woah, yeah
Yeah, ah
Woah, woah

===== Billie Eilish - bad guy =====
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad

===== Billie Eilish - when the party's over =====
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

===== Billie Eilish - Happier Than Ever =====
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Fuck you)

===== Billie Eilish - What Was I Made For? =====
I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
'Cause I, 'cause I
Think I forgot how to be happy
Somethin' I'm not, but somethin' I can be
Somethin' I wait for
Somethin' I'm made for

===== Billie Eilish - idontwannabeyouanymore =====
Ba-da-da-da-da
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Anymore
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break
I, I don't wanna be you

===== Billie Eilish - Bored =====
Ah, ah
The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run, ah
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you say I need, say I need
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need? (I need)
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
I'm home alone, you're God-knows-where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair, ah
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me
What makes you sure you're all I need?
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn

===== Billie Eilish - bellyache =====
Mind
Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind?
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Mind)
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless
I lost my mind
I don't mind
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache)
Maybe it's in the gutter (Mind)
What an expensive fake (Mind)
My V is for Vendetta (Mind)

===== Billie Eilish - WILDFLOWER =====
Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go
She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?
But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
(Mm) Hmm
Well, good things don't last (Good things don't last)
And life moves so fast (Life moves so fast)
I'd never ask who was better (I'd never ask who was better)
'Cause she couldn't be (Couldn't)
More different from me (Different)
Happy and free in leather (Happy)
And I know that you love me (You love me)
You don’t need to remind me (Remind me)
Wanna put it all behind me, but baby
I see her in the back of my mind (Back of my mind) all the time (All the time)
Feels like a fever (Like a fever), like I’m burning alive (Burning alive), like a sign
You say no one knows you so well (Oh)
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
Valentine's Day, cryin’ in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself
And I wonder
Do you see her in the back of your mind in my eyes?
You say no one knows you so well
Valentine's Day, cryin' in the hotel
I know you didn’t mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself

===== Billie Eilish - you should see me in a crown =====
Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
Your silence is my favorite sound
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty
Crown
You should see me in a crown (You should see me, see me)
Your silence is my favorite sound (You should see me, see me)

===== Billie Eilish - Therefore I Am =====
I'm not your friend
Or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable (Got a lotta)
Interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused
Did you have fun?
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm not your friend (I'm not your friend)
You think that you're the man (They wanna, they can try)
Or anything, damn (They wanna)

===== Billie Eilish - TV =====
I don't wanna talk right now
I just wanna watch TV
I'll stay in the pool and drown
So I don't have to watch you leave
I put on Survivor just to watch somebody suffer
Maybe I should get some sleep
Sinking in the sofa while they all betray each other
What's the point of anything?
All of my friends are missing again
That's what happens when you fall in love
You don't have the time, you leave them all behind
You tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
Don't know where you are right now
Did you see me on TV?
I'll try not to starve myself
Just because you're mad at me
And I'll be in denial for at least a little while
What about the plans we made?
The internet's gone wild watching movie stars on trial
While they're overturning Roe v. Wade
Now all of my friends are missing again
'Cause that's what happens when you fall in love
And you tell yourself, "It's fine, you're just in love"
And I don't get along with anyone
Maybe I'm the problem
Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I'm the problem
Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm the problem

===== Billie Eilish - watch =====
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
Now you know
Now I'm free
Watch my heart burn
Ooh, never let you back
Let you back, let you back
Never gonna let you back, let you back

===== Billie Eilish - CHIHIRO =====
To take my love away
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name
Not today, not tomorrow
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow
I got change (Yup), you could borrow (Borrow, borrow, borrow)
Not today, maybe tomorrow
Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?
Did you take
My love away
From me? Me
Me
Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face
Said, "I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break"
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?
I don't, I don't know why I called
I don't know you at all
I don't know you
Not at all
And that's when you found me
I was waitin' in the garden
Contemplatin', beg your pardon
But there's a part of me that recognizes you
Do you feel it too?
When you told me it was serious
Were you serious? Mm
They told me they were only curious
Now it's serious, mm
Wringing my hands in my lap
And they tell me it's all been a trap
And you don't know if you'll make it back
I said, "No, don't say that"
(Wringing my hands in my lap)
(And you tell me it's all been a trap)
(And you don't know if you'll make it back)
(But I said, "No, don't say that")
(Tell me it's all been a trap)
(Don't know if you'll make it back)
(Don't say that)
Hm-hm

===== Maroon 5 - Memories =====
Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

When I believed in forever and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

When I felt all of the hatred was too powerful to stop (Ooh, yeah)
Now my heart feel like an ember and it's lighting up the dark
I'll carry these torches for ya that you know I'll never drop, yeah
Here's to the ones that we got (Oh-oh)

===== Maroon 5 - Payphone =====
I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
If happy-ever-afters did exist
I would still be holdin' you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick, oh
You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine (Oh)
I don't expect you to care (Yeah)
I know I said it before, but
Now I'm paralyzed (Oh)
All of my change I spent on you (Oh, oh)
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick (Uh)
Now I'm at a payphone
Man, fuck that shit
I be out spendin' all this money while you sittin' 'round
Wonderin' why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Tellin' me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you coulda saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you
Yeah, I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Woo)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong (Yeah)
Where are the plans we made for two? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
If happy-ever-after's did exist (Oh, then)
And all these fairytales are full of shit (Yeah)
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick
Yeah, now I'm at a payphone

===== Maroon 5 - Sugar =====
I'm hurtin', baby, I'm broken down
I need your lovin', lovin', I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm somethin' weak
You got me beggin', beggin', I'm on my knees
I don't wanna be needin' your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killin' me when you're away
Ooh, baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste
Your sugar, yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good lovin', make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up
Don't leave me hangin', hangin', come give me some
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm livin' for
Sugar, yes, please
Your sugar, yes, please (Your sugar, yes, please)
Yeah
I want that red velvet, I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
'Cause, girl, you're hotter than a Southern California day
And I wanna play no games, you don't gotta be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No makeup on, that's my sugar
Sugar, yes, please (Please)
Won't you come and put it down on me? (Down on me)

===== Maroon 5 - Maps =====
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road, I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?
I was there for you in your darkest times
I was there for you in your darkest night
But I wonder, where were you?
When I was at my worst, down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder, where were you?
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
Following, following, following to you
Following, following, following
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
And now, I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you, ooh
I was there for you in your darkest nights
Oh, oh, oh, ah
Ooh, oh, oh, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah
Ah, ah, mmm, ah
Oh, I was there for you, oh, in your darkest time
Oh, I was there for you, oh, in your darkest night

===== Maroon 5 - Moves Like Jagger =====
Oh, na
Oh
Just shoot for the stars if it feels right
Then aim for my heart if you feel like it
Take me away, and make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now we're naked
You say I'm a kid, my ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this (Uh)
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you
All the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger (Uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Uh)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
Maybe it's hard when you feel like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me, I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you wanna steer, but I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
I've got them moves like Jagger (Woo, uh)
I don't need to try to control you (Oh yeah, uh)
I've got them moves like Jagger (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Uh, you wanna know how to make me smile?
Take control, own me just for the night (Ah)
And if I share my secret, you're gonna have to keep it (Shh)
Nobody else can see this (Ah, uh)
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh, baby, rub me right, yeah
And if I share my secret, you're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this, hey, hey, hey, yeah

===== Maroon 5 - She Will Be Loved =====
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me (to) catch her every time she falls, yeah
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
(Please don't try so hard to say goodbye)
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh)
(I don't mind spending every day, ooh)
(Out on your corner in the pouring rain)

===== Maroon 5 - This Love =====
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart, oh
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Woah, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But uh-oh
I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright, oh-oh)
My pressure on your hips, sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
Because I know that's what you want me to do
Her heart is breaking in front of me
And my heart is breaking in front of me
This love has taken its toll on me (Oh, yeah, yeah)
She said goodbye too many times before (Yeah)
And her heart is breaking in front of me (Yeah)
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore (Yeah)

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you

And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you
So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
Try to tell you "no," but my body keeps on telling you "yes"
Try to tell you "stop," but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell
Making me love you (Making me love you)
Let it all go (Let it all go)
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo (Like a tattoo, yeah)

===== Maroon 5 - Beautiful Mistakes =====
It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back
I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake
Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, ay
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality
I wouldn't take 'em back
Nah-nah-nah (Yeah, yeah)
You did me wrong 'cause I let you (Let you)
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' somethin' different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you dreamin' lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)
Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pullin' your hair (Hair)
Smellin' your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)
You're toxic

===== Maroon 5 - Cold =====
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's somethin' goin' on
I don't understand why you're so cold
Are we takin' time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Actin' like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleepin' up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?
Distant, when we're kissin'
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
Woah, yeah
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killin' me
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Distant (Oh), when we're kissin' (Yeah)
Feel so different (Yeah)
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah (So tough, it's a cold world)
Woah, yeah (So tough, it's a cold world)
Never thought that you were like this (That you like this)
I took the tag off and made you priceless (Yeah, yeah)

Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah (Light switch)

Thinkin' that I'm sleepin' on the four-letter word

You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be

I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say (Hear what you say)
Girl, I tried to give you space

I see there's somethin' goin' on (Goin' on)

So tough, it's a cold world

===== Maroon 5 - Sunday Morning =====
Yeah
Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin (Like that)
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life is hard)
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)
That may be all I'll need
In darkness, she is all I see (All I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
(Yeah) Fingers trace your every outline (Oh yeah, yeah)
(Yeah) Paint a picture with my hands (Oh, oh, woah)
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends
That may be all I'll need (All I'll need)
In darkness, she is all I see
Oh yeah
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life gets hard)
Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, "someday it will bring me back to you", yeah
(Someday, oh, someday, oh)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
And you may not know
That may be all I'll need (All I need)
In darkness, she is all I see (You are all I see)
Driving slow, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
There's a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair

Dirty looks from your mother
Never seen you in a dress that color, no

===== Maroon 5 - Won't Go Home Without You =====
I asked her to stay
But she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say, oh
The words that would mend
The things that were broken
But now it's far too late, she's gone away
Every night, you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, "Why does this happen to me?"
"Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
The taste of her breath
I'll never get over
The noises that she made kept me awake, oh
The weight of the things
That remained unspoken
Built up so much, it crushed us everyday
Oh, woah-oh
Of all the things I felt but never really showed
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go, oh-oh-oh
And I won't go home without you

===== Maroon 5 - Daylight =====
Here I am waiting
I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast?
This is our last night, but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know when I wake
I will have to slip away
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, oh
Here I am staring
At your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright
The stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down
This is way too hard
'Cause I know when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory
I never want it to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want
Ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa (Yeah)
Ooh-whoa, oh (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh-whoa, oh

===== Maroon 5 - Misery =====
Oh, yeah
So scared of breakin' it that you won't let it bend, uh
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send, uh
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
And you'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be
And I'll set you free (Oh, yeah)
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me, oh, yeah
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killin' me, oh, yeah
Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back (Yeah)
Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine, uh
The way it feels to be completely intertwined, uh
And not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know, uh
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show
And I'll set you free
And there ain't nobody who can comfort me, oh, yeah
I'm gonna get you back (And I wanna get you back), yeah
You say your faith is shakin'
And you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
And I'm gettin' there, I don't care where I have to run
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah
Now I wanna get you back
And I'm gonna get you back (Uh, come on)
You really got me bad (You got me bad)

I'm gonna get you back

===== Maroon 5 - Love Somebody =====
I know your insides are feeling so hollow (Ooh)
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah (Ooh)

Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
(Aah) Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones

Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
(Aah) And your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones
(Aah) And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
It's true
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine
And all the things that you do

===== Coldplay - The Scientist =====
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
And tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
No, let's go back to the start
Runnin' in circles, comin' up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessin' at numbers and figures
Pullin' your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
And tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Runnin' in circles, chasin' our tails
Comin' back as we are
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm goin' back to the start
Oh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

===== Coldplay - Fix You =====
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streamin' down your face
When you lose somethin' you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Tears stream down your face
When you lose somethin' you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face, and I...
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes

===== Coldplay - Hymn for the Weekend =====
And said drink from me, drink from me
(I, oh, I, oh, I)
That we shoot across the sky
Got me feeling drunk and high
Poured on a symphony
So high, so high
Drink from me, drink from me
Got me feelin' drunk and high
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood
I said, drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
When I'm low, low, low, low
I, oh, I, oh, I
Got me feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high (Woo)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars (Stars) come out
Now I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, so high, so high
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the (That we shoot)

===== Coldplay - Paradise =====
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
And dreamed of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly
And dream of para-, para-, paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of para-, para-, paradise
La, la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la, la-la-la, la-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
She said, "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, I know the sun must set to rise"
This could be para-, para-, paradise
This could be para-, para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

===== Coldplay - My Universe =====
You (You), you are (You are) my universe
And I (I) just want (Just want) to put you first
And you (You), you are (You are) my universe, and I
In the night, I lie and look up at you
When the morning comes, I watch you rise
There's a paradise they couldn't capture
That bright infinity inside your eyes
매일 밤 네게 날아가 (가)
꿈이란 것도 잊은 채
나 웃으며 너를 만나 (나)
Never-ending forever, baby
And you (You), you are (You are) my universe
And you make my world light up inside
어둠이 내겐 더 편했었지
길어진 그림자 속에서 (Eyes)
And they said that we can't be togethеr
Because, becausе we come from different sides
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
(You make my world)
You make my world light up inside
Make my world light up inside
나를 밝혀주는 건
너란 사랑으로 수 놓아진 별
내 우주의 넌
또 다른 세상을 만들어 주는 걸
너는 내 별이자 나의 우주니까
지금 이 시련도 결국엔 잠시니까
너는 언제까지나 지금처럼 밝게만 빛나줘
우리는 너를 따라 이 긴 밤을 수놓을 거야
너와 함께 날아가
When I'm without you, I'm crazy
자 어서 내 손을 잡아
We are made of each other, baby
And I (I) just want (Just want) to put you first (To put you first)
You, you are (You are)
I just want (Just want)
My universe
You, you are (You are) my universe, and I
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

===== Coldplay - Sparks =====
Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one we know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do
I say, oh
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold onto
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh, yeah, I will, yeah, I will, yes, I will
I said, oh
I cry, oh
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Sing it out
La-la-la-la, oh-oh

===== Coldplay - Adventure of a Lifetime =====
"Turn your magic on," Umi, she'd say
"Everythin' you want's a dream away
We are legends every day"
That's what she told me
"Turn your magic on," to me, she'd say
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds"
Now, I feel my heart beatin'
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
(Alive again)
Said, "I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me"
Oh, I can feel my heart beatin'
'Cause you make me feel
We are diamonds takin' shape
We are diamonds takin' shape"
(Woo, woo-hoo)
If we've only got this life, this adventure, oh, then I
And if we've only got this life, you'll get me through alive
And if we've only got this life, in this adventure, oh, then I
Want to share it with you, with you, with you
Oh, see, yeah, see, yeah, I
Woo-hoo (Woo-hoo)

===== Coldplay - Clocks =====
The lights go out, and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead, singin'
Come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head, and a
Trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waitin' to be tamed, singin'
You are
Confusion that never stops
Closin' walls and tickin' clocks, gonna
Come back and take you home
I could not stop, that you now know, singin'
Come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities, am I
A part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'
And nothin' else compares
Oh, nothin' else compares
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home (You are) home, where I wanted to go

===== Coldplay - Magic =====
Call it magic, call it true
I call it magic when I'm with you
And I just got broken, broken into two
Still I call it magic when I'm next to you
And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Call it magic, cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still I call it magic, such a precious jewel
Wanna fall, fall so far
I wanna fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
I call it ma-, ma-ma-magic
And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
"Still believe in magic?"
Oh, yes, I do
Yes, I do
Of course, I do

===== Coldplay - Trouble =====
Oh no, I see
A spiderweb is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said
Oh no, what's this?
A spiderweb, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done
And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm
A spiderweb, and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble
Singin' that I, I never meant to cause you trouble
They spun a web for me
And they spun a web for me

===== Coldplay - In My Place =====
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
And I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
Yeah, how long must you wait for it?
Yeah, how long must you pay for it?
Oh, for it?
I was scared, I was scared
Tired and underprepared
But I'll wait for it
And if you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you, yeah
Sing it please, please, please
Come back, come sing to me, to me, me
Come on and sing it out, now, now
Come on and sing it out to me, me
Come back and sing
Oh, yeah

===== Coldplay - Higher Power =====
Three, two, one
Bah, bah-ooh, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah-ooh
Sometimes, I just can't take it
Sometimes, I just can't take it and it isn't alright
I'm not gonna make it
And I think my shoe's untied (Oh-oh)
I'm like a broken record
I'm like a broken record and I'm not playing right
Drocer nekorb a ekil m'I
Till you tell me on the heavenly phone
To hold tight (Hold tight)
Come on (Come on)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Come on (Come on, yeah)
Don't let go, oh-oh
Hold tight (Hold tight)
"It's alright, it's alright," you said
I got my hands up shaking just to let you know
That you've got a higher power
Got me singin' every sеcond, dancin' every hour
Oh, yeah, you'vе got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know (Oh-oh)
This boy is electric (Hmm)
This boy is electric and you're sparklin' light
The universe connected
And I'm buzzin' night after night after night (Oh-oh)
This joy is electric (Hmm)
This joy is electric and you're circuiting through
I'm so happy that I'm alive
Happy I'm alive at the same time as you
'Cause you've got a higher power
Got me singin' every second, dancin' every hour
Oh, yeah, you've got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know (I wanna know, oh-oh)
You got, yeah, you got a high
You got, yeah, you got a higher
You got, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
You got, oh, you got a high
You've got, oh, you've got a high
My hands up shaking just to let you know now
You've got a higher power
You got me singin' every second, dancin' any hour
You're once in any lifetime, I'm goin' a million miles an hour
When, for so long, I'd been down on my knees
Then your love song saved me over and over
For so long, I'd been down on my knees
Till your love song floats me on, ee-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh)

===== Coldplay - Christmas Lights =====
Christmas night, another fight
Tears, we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Up above, candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on to all those
Chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you, darling
And I always will
Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Those Christmas lights light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh, oh, oh, ohh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, Christmas lights light up the street
Light up the fireworks in me
Those Christmas lights keep shining on

===== Coldplay - Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall =====
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beatin' to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday mornin' feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And Heaven is in sight
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart
As we saw, woah, this light
I swear you emerge, blinking in to
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh, is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
Is a—, is a waterfall
Every teardrop is a—, is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still I'll raise the flag
Ooh, it was a waterfall, a waterfall
(Yeah!) Every tear, every tear, every teardrop is a waterfall
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) Every tear, every tear, every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear, every teardrop is a waterfall

===== Coldplay - Speed of Sound =====
How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found (Got found)
And birds go flyin' at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flyin' from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me
All those places I got found
Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand
All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can invent
Some get made, and some get sent
Ooh-ooh
Birds go flyin' at the speed of sound

===== Coldplay - Everglow =====
Oh, they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you celestial
Like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle you circled in perfect purple
So how come things move on? How come cars don't slow?
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should but I can't let you go
But when I'm cold, cold
Yeah, when I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow
There's a feelin' within me, everglow
Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night we'd be friends 'til we die
But the changin' of winds and the way waters flow
Life is short as the fallin' of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you're with me and the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
And you give me this feelin', this everglow
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah, I live for this feelin', this everglow
So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

===== Coldplay - Princess of China =====
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Once upon a time, somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I've got to go, I've got to go
Once upon a time, we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Once upon a time, we burned bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on
Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game
Now why'd you have to go
Have to go and throw water on my flame?
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
You stole my star
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
Oh, you really hurt me, oh
Oh, you really hurt me

===== ABBA - Dancing Queen =====
Ooh
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Diggin' the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music
Getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music
Everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh, yeah
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another
Anyone will do

===== ABBA - Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) =====
Half-past twelve
And I'm watchin' the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm livin' in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

===== ABBA - Mamma Mia =====
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind—it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, woah
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Mamma mia, even if I say
"Bye-bye", leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
"Bye-bye" doesn't mean forever

===== ABBA - Lay All Your Love On Me =====
I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear
Don't go sharing your devotion
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
What can I do?

===== ABBA - The Winner Takes It All =====
I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play
The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny
I was in your arms, thinkin' I belonged there
I figured it made sense building me a fence
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (Yes, it's plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain?)
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside, you must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed
The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always stayin' low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise if it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence
But you see, the winner takes it all
(So the winner takes it all)
(And the loser has to fall)
(Throw a dice, cold as ice)
(Way down here, someone dear)
(Takes it all, has to fall)
(Yes, it's plain, why complain?)

===== ABBA - Take A Chance On Me =====
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line
(Take a chance, take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
Honey, I'm still free; take a chance on me
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance)
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down
(Take a-take a chance-chance, take a chance, take a chance, take a chance)
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie
If you put me to the test, if you let me try
Take a chance on me
That's all I ask of you honey
We can go dancing, we can go walking
As long as we're together (As long as we're together)
Listen to some music, maybe just talking
Get to know you better (Get to know you better)
'Cause you know I've got
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you
It's magic
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair
But I think you know
That I can't let go
Come on, give me a break, will you?
Oh, you can take your time, baby, I'm in no hurry
Know I'm gonna get ya (Know I'm gonna get ya)
You don't wanna hurt me, baby, don't worry
I ain't gonna let you (I ain't gonna let ya)
Let me tell you now
My love is strong enough to last when things are rough
You say that I waste my time, but I can't get you off my mind
No, I can't let go
'Cause I love you so
Gonna do my very best, baby, can't you see?
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)
Ba-ba ba-ba ba, ba-ba ba-ba baa
Ba-ba ba-ba ba, ba-ba ba-ba baa-ba-ba
Gonna do my very best, baby, can't you see

===== ABBA - Waterloo =====
My, my
At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh, yeah
And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself
Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Woah, woah, woah, woah, Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose
So how could I ever refuse?
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh

===== ABBA - Chiquitita =====
Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you broken and fettered
(How it hurts to see you cry)
(And how it hurts to see you sad)
I hope we can patch it up together
Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go
And the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again
And the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky
And shining above you
(Even though you cry)
(The sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more
(So let me hear you sing some more)
Like you did before
(The way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown-out candle
All is gone, and it seems too hard to handle
I see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet
(You and I, we know)
(How all the heartaches come and go)
(You’ll be dancing once again)
(And all the pain you take will end)

===== ABBA - Super Trouper =====
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends
Still, I'm thinking about you only
(Still, I'm thinking about you only)
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be alright
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per) Lights are gonna find me
Like I always do… (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)

===== ABBA - Money, Money, Money =====
I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay
Ain't it sad?
And still, there never seems to be a single penny left for me
That's too bad
In my dreams, I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Always sunny
A-ha, ah
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find, but I can't get him off my mind
And if he happens to be free, I bet he wouldn't fancy me
So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same

===== ABBA - Angeleyes =====
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
"Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play"
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes, angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Keep thinking
Keep thinking, had to pay the price

===== ABBA - SOS =====
Where are those happy days? They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love? I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good
So, when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out, I wish I understood
What happened to our love? It used to be so good
And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S.

===== ABBA - Voulez-Vous =====
People everywhere
A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Giving out a spark
Across the room, your eyes are glowing in the dark
And here we go again
We know the start, we know the end
Masters of the scene
We've done it all before
And now we're back to get some more
You know what I mean
Voulez-vous? (Ah-ha)
Take it now or leave it (Ah-ha)
Now is all we get (Ah-ha)
Nothing promised, no regrets (Ah-ha)
Ain't no big decision (Ah-ha)
You know what to do (Ah-ha)
La question c'est «Voulez-vous?»
Voulez-vous?
I know what you think
"The girl means business, so I'll offer her a drink"
Looking mighty proud
I see you leave your table, pushing through the crowd
I'm really glad you came
You know the rules, you know the game
Master of the scene
Nothing promised, no regrets
Voulez-vous? (Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha)

===== ABBA - Fernando =====
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
Though I never thought that we could lose
Yes, if I had to do the same again

===== ABBA - Does Your Mother Know =====
You're so hot, teasing me
So you're blue, but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl, you're only a child
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow
I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
Now you're so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile
Smile, but girl, you're only a child
Flirt a little, maybe...

===== ABBA - Slipping Through My Fingers =====
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go?
(Slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers

===== ABBA - Knowing Me, Knowing You =====
No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do
Memories, good days, bad days (Memories, good days, bad days)
They'll be with me always (They'll be with me always)
In these old familiar rooms, children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say

===== ABBA - I Have A Dream =====
I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future, even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream
I have a dream
I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness; still another mile
You can take the future even if you fail

===== ABBA - Honey, Honey =====
Honey, honey, how you thrill me, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, nearly kill me, aha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy
Honey, honey, let me feel it, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, don't conceal it, aha, honey honey
The way that you kiss goodnight
(The way that you kiss me goodnight)
The way that you hold me tight
(The way that you're holding me tight)
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing
I don't wanna hurt you, baby, I don't wanna see you cry
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high
But I'm gonna stick to you, boy, you'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be
Honey, honey, touch me, baby, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, hold me, baby, aha, honey honey
You look like a movie star
(You look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are
(I know just who you are)
And, honey, to say the least, you're a dog-gone beast
I heard about you before
(I heard about you before)
(I wanted to know you some more)
And now I know what they mean
You're a love machine

===== ABBA - Thank You For The Music =====
I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan
I've been so lucky
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing

===== Fergie - Big Girls Don't Cry (Personal) =====
La, da, da, da
The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
Be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We got some straightening out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
The path that I'm walking, I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown, full grown
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay
Like the little schoolmate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and UNO cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be my Valentine
Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I wanna hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers
And share our secret worlds
But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late and dark outside
I need to be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity, yeah
La, da, da, da, da, da

===== Fergie - Glamorous =====
Are you ready?
Yeah
Polow da Don
It's Fergie
If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home, you say it
"If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home"
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S
We flying first class, up in the sky
Poppin' champagne
Livin' my life in the fast lane
I won't change by the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy (Are you ready?)
The glamorous
The glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy
Wear them gold and diamond rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperones and limousines
Shopping for expensive things
I be on the movie screens
Magazines and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell
Drive-through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show, after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin' and reminiscin'
On days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm
First class, up in the sky
I'm talking champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
Lifestyle so rich and famous, Robin Leach'll get jealous
Half a million for the stones, takin' trips from here to Rome
So if you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yes
Flyin' first class, up in the sky
I got problems up to here, I got people in my ear
Telling me these crazy thangs that I don't wanna know (Fuck y'all)
I got money in the bank, and I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank, thank you, really though
'Cause I remember yesterday, when I dreamt about them days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope
Damn, it's been a long road, and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know
(If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home, you say it)
My daddy told me so
("If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home")
He let his daughter know
(He said, "If you ain't got no money, take yo' broke ass home," you say it)

===== Fergie - Fergalicious =====

Drama little mama, I don't wanna take your man (Man)

===== Fergie - A Little Party Never Killed Nobody (All We Got) =====
Just one night all we got
I ain't got time for you, baby
Either you're mine or you're not
Make up your mind sweet, baby
Right here, right now's all we got
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop
Islands, diamonds, trips around the world
Don't mean a thing if I ain't your girl
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we come on
All we got, got, got, got, got, got, got, got, got
Got, got, got, got, got, got, got, got, got
Goddamn
Glad that you made it, look around
You don't see one person sitting down
They got drinks in their hands and the room's abuzz
At the end of the night maybe you'll find love
Fake chit-chat 'bout the things they got
And my stout reputation of keepin' it hot
I'm the party of the year and my master plan
Is to make you realize I'm your man
See the people get live underneath the moonlight
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi, hold on while I take this flick
Speakeasy, rockin' the feathers, I'm breezy
Hope you can keep up boys, 'cause believe me, I'm the bee's knees
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, ah-ah-ah, ow
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah-ah-ah, ow
What do you think, GoonRock?
Are you ready?

She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, baby)

Boy, you looked right through me, mm-mm
Played it cool, but I knew you knew
That cupid hit me, mm-mm
You got me trippin' (Oh), stumblin' (Oh), flippin' (Oh), fumblin'
So clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love (In - in, love - love)
You got me slippin' (Oh), tumblin' (Oh), sinkin' (Oh), crumblin'
So in love with you
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, no)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (No how)
Can't breathe, when you touch my sleeve
Butterflies so crazy, mmm-mmm
Whoa now, think I'm goin' down
Friends don't know what's with me, mmm-mmm
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, please)
You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This "love sick" thing
I like serious relationships, and, uh
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cause every time a boyfriend and I break up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug comes right back up and bites me
And I'm back
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (In love)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (Oh, God)
She can't help it, the girl can't help it (I'm back in love)

===== Fergie - M.I.L.F. $ =====
You got that, you got that
You got that milk money

Heard you in the mood for a little MILFshake
Welcome to the Dairy Dutchess Love Factory

Come on in the front door, leaving at the back door
Whip it, flip it, hey
Been working at your service
To give it to ya
Didn't mean to make you nervous

Hating-ass hoes, but I don't give a fuck

===== Fergie - You Already Know =====
Life's a movie, let the camera roll
Fast life moving, ain't no going slow
That's right, baby, you already know
You already know, hope you're ready
Ready, steady, steady, rocking (Let's go)
Let it go, get rolled, I just can't hold
Back and forth 'cause I'm the girl with soul
Ain't controlling effects, so what the heck
Rock the discotheque 'cause this groove is up next
Tease on the camera, freeze while I animate
I'm no amateur, I'ma laminate
I'ma assassinate all the imitates
Then I'ma take a break, and meditate
Hmm, let me think about it
Put my little noodle on a problem, then I drink about it
Drink a little, swig a little, sip a little, spill a little
Feel a little loopy when I get a little tipsy
Beez got me feeling like a gypsy
Smoking on a hookah got me feeling like a hippie, trippy
Gone for a minute, yep, you missed me
Now Fergie back with a bag full of tricksies, what
This is how I do, this is how I do
Yo, ayo, let it go, let's go
I keep a bar like Esco
I wanna ball, where the nets go?
I'm on stage, you can stand where the guests go
Bitches is my sons, they don't wanna leave the nest though
They like, aw, where the ref go?
I-I got these hoes scared to pass, I got that intercept flow
I made a movie like Seth Ro'
And since I came in the game, they careers on death row
Damn, they ain't seen young Nicki in a week
Five shows, made three millie in a week
You are now looking at the the best, the elite
Too bad you can't go and invest them critiques
I'm thick and petite, tell 'em quick, pick a seat
I pull up in the Ghost, no sheets, trick or treat
I know they on E, but I don't give a F though
Bad attitude, but my pussy is the best though
Ready, steady, steady, rocking
Come get some, you little bums
Dudes want the cake, but they can't get a crumb
From the original, sexual, visual dope chick and all that good shit
Charismatic when I'm at it
When I add it up, I'm mathematic, baby
Top game, I'm out the attic
There you have it, no dramatics, hold the static
Pose for the camera, daddy, I'm vogueing
Baby, I'm glamorous, center folding
Grammys and AMAs, I'm holding
Amazing the way I keep shit frozen
Cool, that's true
Got new shoes and a new attitude
Got my hair did, got a new hairdo
Come and see me at a venue near you
I said watch me
I said watch me when I drop it
Just watch and learn, baby
Watch and learn, baby
It's hot, it burns, so I drop it
Oh, baby, watch me when I drop it
You didn't know I could drop it like that, did you?
This is how I do (Come on), this is how I do (Let's go)
This is how I do (Yeah), this is how I do (Yeah, uh-huh)
Make some noise for my girl Fergie Ferg
Rrrr
Double Dutchess
Wait, hold up, wait, hold up, wait, hold up
Let's get into the mood, let's get into the groove, mm
Wait, wait, hold up
Let's get into it, let's get into it now
I just wanna feel ya
I just wanna see ya
Let me scratch my nails up on your head
Let me scratch my nails all down your back
Real light, real smooth
Just like you like it
Baby, baby, I know how you like it
Ooh, baby, baby, I know how you like it
I know what you like
Wanna give it to you, baby, tonight
I'm gonna give it to you, baby, tonight

===== Fergie - Life Goes On =====
Mmm
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Every day when I wake up
Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup
But it seems like I never finish
It's always half full (Or is it half empty?)
Maybe it's my own superstition or a kind of self protection
If it all looks bad, why would I wanna look ahead?
Oh, oh, oh, still sittin' here
Just watching the sun go down (Down), down (Down), down
Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Damn it, baby, what you gonna do?
But who cares anyway?
(Haha, yeah, who really cares?)
Every conversation gets me high on motivation
Gets me craving of your own familiar situation (Yeah)
Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable
In the midst of all the madness (Remember life's beautiful)
Still, I'm feeling restless, thinking I should rest less
Work more, play hard, ready for the encore
Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for? (Two times)
In my heart I know, less is more (More)
More (More), more, more, more
It's up to you what you're gonna do
Starting to think it's out of my hands
Is it all gonna be worth it in the end?
'Cause it's safe here in my comfort zone
Never stray too far from home (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But then again, this way I'll never know, never know
Maybe I should go
Go crazy, go insane, go for everything
Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching
Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili?, uh
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli, uh
And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly
They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really?
Really, really? Really, really though?
Really, really, really though?
Feel the vibration of the higher ground
Love always leads to the highest sound
Many conversations, people makin' speculations
As to my procrastination due to my revelations
And then they get fugazi
You call yourself a rider
You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti
Baby, don't underestimate my underdog mentality
We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari
Mmm, mmm
You could go, you could stay

===== Fergie - Labels Or Love =====
Shopping for labels, shopping for love
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of
Shopping for labels, shopping for love (One, two)
Manolo and Louis, it's all I'm thinking of (One, two, three, turn the lights on)
I already know what my addiction is (Addiction is)
I be looking for labels, I ain't looking for love
I shop for purses while love walks out the door (Out the door)
Don't cry, buy a bag and get over it
And I'm not concerned with all the politics (Politics)
It's a lot of men, I know I could find another
All I know is that I'm always happy when I walk out the store
(Store, store)
I guess I'm Supercalifragi-sexy
Nothing to be playing with
I love him, hate him, kiss him, diss him
Try to walk a mile in my kicks
Love's like a runway, but which one do I love more?
No emotional baggage, just big bags filled with Dior (Oh)
Love's like a runway, so what's all the fussing for?
Let's stop chasing those boys and shop some more
One, two, one, two, three, turn the lights on
I know I might come off as negative (Negative)
But relationships are often so hard to tame (So hard to tame)
A Prada dress has never broke my heart before
And ballin's something that I'm fed up with
I'ma do the damn thing, watch me do the damn thing
'Cause I know (Know) that my credit card will help me put out the flames
(Flames, flames)
Gucci, Fendi, Prada purses, purchasing them finer things
Men, they come a dime a dozen, just give me them diamond rings
I'm into a lot of bling, Cadillac, Chanel and Coach
Fellas boast, but they can't really handle my female approach
Buying things is hard to say, rocking Christian Audigier
Manolo or Polo, taking photos in my Cartier
So we can go all the way, I know you might hate it, but
I'ma shop for labels while them ladies lay and wait for love, oh

===== Fergie - Hungry =====
This special
Biggest
Global
Huh, yeah
Woo, yeah
Uh-hm, yeah
To say it's complicated, understatement of the year (Yeah)
Well maybe conflict made it the new flavor in your ear (Yeah)
They know that I'm a problem, that's why everybody scared (Scare)
Whatever doesn't kill you, can make you an ill-ionaire, yeah
Uh, just turn the headphones up or make the windows roll up
I make they hands go up
When I show up and I blow it 'til I'm full up, wait, hold up
Girl up in the mirror, uh, only one I fear-a, uh
You say you the realest, I told you I'm the illest
Sick, sick, mmm
Hungry, starving, mhm
Not thirsty, m-m-mm, just hungry
Ambitious, still hungry
Still hungry
Woo!
I'm moonwalkin’ on marble floors (Introduce yourself)
Rick Ross, I'm just drippin' sauce (Huh)
Bitches see me and they all just wave (Boss)
Rolls Royce and we call this Wraith (Woo)
I fuck up money like I'm Escobar
Ballin', ballin', Kobe Bryant, that boy livin’ large
No room for medium, that means you thinkin' small
Ferrari, Fergie, switchin’ gears, she rockin' with a boss (Boss)
I close my eyes, I must be telepathic (Haha)
Look over haters, tripling my assets (Boss)
It takes courage to accomplish these things
Fergie's my queen, I'm the king, now come kiss on our rings
Hungry
El Chapo
Starving
Rinzel
Mhm, not thirsty, m-m-mm, just hungry
Ferrari Fergie

===== Fergie - Barracuda =====
So this ain't the end, I saw you again today
I had to turn my heart away
Smile like the sun, kisses for real
And tales, it never fails
You're lying so low in the weeds
And I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now wouldn't you, Barracuda?
Uh, oh
Ooh
Oh, back over time, we were all tryin' for free
Met the porpoise and me, ah
No right, no wrong, selling a song, a name
Whisper game
And if the real thing don't do the trick
Uh, you better make up something quick
You're gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick
Ooh, Barracuda
"Sell me, sell you," the porpoise said
Dive down, deep down to save my head
You
I think you got the blues too
All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools
Silly, silly fools
Now if the real thing don't do the trick
No, you better make up something quick
Ooh, oh, Barra-Barracuda
Sock it to me, sock it to me
Sock it to me, oh
Barracuda, Barracuda
Oh, oh
Oh

===== Fergie - Here I Come =====
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't nobody rocking like this (No)
Ain't nobody out there swift like this (No)
Everywhere I go all I hear is this (You're alright)
Yes, I must confess
And it's true we keeps it fresh (Yeah)
'Cause keeping it fresh is my main interest (Yeah)
Just staying consistent, flipping them hits (You're alright)
Can't hate on this
So hate if you wanna, wanna
'Cause that ain't gon' make me wanna
Go stop what I'm doing to you
'Cause my beat go boom, boom
In the club, they be jumping, jumping
To the bass that's like pumping, pumping
And the girls like the speakers thumping
'Cause I told them to shake their humps, oh
In any minute, I'll be rolling through
So get ready, so get ready
And in a minute I'll be coming through
'Cause here I come, get ready, 'cause here I come
I'm coming for you, baby (Get ready, 'cause here I come)
Taking you higher now (Get ready, 'cause here I come)
Get ready, 'cause here I come
Ain't nobody ripping like me (No)
F to the E-R-G-I-E  (Yeah)
I rock it hardcore for my fly ladies (You're alright)
I rock it, yes, indeed
I represent Los Angeles city (Hey)
Hacienda Heights is the vicinity (Yeah)
The old school homies still rolling with me (You're alright)
Money don't change me
So hate if you gotta, gotta
'Cause I got a lot-a, lot-a
Fans that will holla, holla
I'm making it hot, hot
In the club they be jumping, jumping
Will.i.am stepping in just like a gentleman
Dressed to impress, just to mess with them feminines
Buy you Long Island, but my name ain't Gilligan
If I get you tipsy, do you mind if I'm feeling 'em?
How you doing? Yeah, yeah
What's the dilly? You can call me Willy
Or call me Billy
You can call me whatever you like, no, really
Just don't call me up 'cause I got a milli
Young dollars in the bank, gotta be frank
Captain Hook chicks quick to make you walk the plank
Pirates of the Caribbean, I ain't being
Robbed for my dividends for not seeing it coming
I keep moving and running, I keep shooting and gunning
I'm holding it down, I ain't fooling around
Will.i.am bring the heat in your town

===== Fergie - Tension =====
All these vibes, so blasé blasé blah
I need your high, c’mon c’mon c’mon
My throat is dry, come pour some more, some more
When we lock eyes, I’m yours, I’m yours, I’m yours
Ooh, your body got these moves, your body
Ooh, your body, higher
Ooh your body, yeah, I know it wants me
Ooh, your body, is blowing my mind, cause
All this tension that we can’t control
Got me catching feelings on my dance floor
Ooh, damn, I’m hoping that we take it home
Got me catching feelings on the dance floor
Ain’t gonna lie, you got me open wide
The way you move is setting me on fire
My throat is sore, come pour some more, some more
You’re all mine, I'm yours, I’m yours, I’m yours
So forget this distance, come and pull me tight
Can you feel this tension? We could go all night
We could get it started, make it radiant
I’m gonna call you daddy when you make me sweat
And you know like I know
I’m getting you alone, I’m getting you alone
I’m bout to take you home, I’m bout to take you home, cause

===== Fergie - A Little Work =====
Got a lot of answers I'm looking for in these meds
'Bout time I talk to somebody, shrink my head
A lot of promises, broken things that were said
And I can't get out of this bed
Got bruises on my heart, plenty scars on my mind
Got blisters under the band-aid over my life
Gonna rip it open and show the world what's there
Lord knows I'm not perfect
When everything around me starts to fall
I rise up again to the call
We're all just a little bit broken (Yeah)
We're all just a little bit hurt (Yeah)
We've all got wounds half open (Yeah)
We all can use a little work
A little work, a little
Gotta wait first of the month to pick up that check
He bounced, and left, it was over, never came back
Had a lot of questions 'bout daddy after he left
Now it's just momma and them kids, and she said
"I'll hold her down, don't you worry, we'll find a way
No matter how, I'll make sure the bills get paid"
She gave it all and thank God their mouths got fed
She prayed the cycle would end
When everything around us starts to fall
We rise up again to the call
Sometimes when you feel like you need it
They send in the medic, woah
But if it's your soul that is bleeding
That slow drip won't help it, no
It's time to get up to the front of the line
The guards of the battle and straight for the mind
Well, well, well, well
There's nothing that's holding you down
Stuck on the ground, far from the crown
'Cause you are a warrior more than you know
A little work, a little (A little, a little)
A little

===== Fergie - Mary Jane Shoes =====
La la la la
When I wear my Mary Jane shoes
I can escape from the blues (Oh, oh-oh)
The whole world seems a little bit brighter, brighter (Brighter)
My heavy steps get a little bit lighter, lighter
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
When I wear my Mary Jane shoes (Ooh)
I'm just like a child in underoos (Underoos, underoos) (Ooh)
From heart and my soles, I feel like I'm seven (Oh, oh, say)
From my head to my toes it's like I'm in heaven, heaven
Whoa, my Mary Jane's (Yeah)
Whoa, my Mary Jane's (Whoa now, oh now)
When I wear Mary Jane shoes (Ooh)
I enjoy to spin the one's and two's (Ooh)
Music has another dimension, yeah
And I can dance with a different perception, whoa (Ooh)
When I step into my shoes, make the lady wanna (Hey)
Feeling high, feeling low, it's caught up in the bubble (Hey)
Everything is beautiful, motherfucking, really great (Great)
When I step into my shoes, make a lady wanna go crazy
Wanna go crazy (Crazy motherfucker)
Wanna go crazy (Crazy)
Wanna go crazy, oh now (Crazy)
Whoa, my Mary Jane's (Whoa, whoa)
Whoa, my Mary Jane's (One, two)
Whoa, my Mary Jane's (Hey, hey, hey)

===== Fergie - All That I Got (The Make Up Song) =====
Do-do-do-do, do
I, I, I, I
Oh-oh, oh, ooh, woah
Woo, hoo-hoo, hoo
Baby, baby, when you're lookin' deep in my eyes
I know you're seeing past my makeup
Into the little girl that used to hide out and cry
When her parents fought, trying to be strong (Do-do-do-do, do)
You can see the hurt in me
The cover ups of secrecy
And all that I aspire to be
You'll see, you'll see (Do-do-do-do, do)
You know who I really am
No entourage or caravan
Do you even give a damn?
About all that, now tell me
Would you love me
If I didn't work out or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby
I'll give you all that I got (Woo, hoo-hoo, hoo)
So, I don't mean to scare you now or push you away
'Cause I'm not tryna rush anything
But when I look into your eyes
I'm not scared to say I see little you
I'm in the picture too (Do-do-do-do, do)
Like a happy family tree
We're together constantly
This could be eventually
We'll see, we'll see
But all that I have got to know
Is with me, baby, will you grow?
Through sun and rain and heavy snow
Oh, tell me so, now baby
I'll give you all that I got, ooh (Woo, hoo-hoo, hoo)
It's as simple as one and two, I'm in love with you
And three and four, you're all I adore
To the seven and eight
See, I've been making mistakes
'Cause when you're on my mind, I just can't think straight
Back to the five and six, I'm all in your mix
And I'm all into you, without the lipstick
Without the L'Oreal
You remain the same angel that I fell for
For real, for real (Ooh, do-do-do-do, do)
If I didn't work out or I didn't change my natural hair? (No, no, no, no)
And I could be the one you want to grow older with, baby (Baby)
I'll give you all that I got (Ooh, no)
(Could you love me?)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, woah-ooh, oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'll give you all that I got
(Woo, hoo-hoo, hoo)
Hey, yeah
Don't let our love end

===== Fergie - Pedestal =====
Da-yi-yi-yi, da-da-da-da
Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da (Ooh, ooh)
Record sales are on the mark
'Cause that's about the time the rumors start
Where all the people talkin' out of they ass
Well, someone's gotta school ya, 'cause ya got no class
Well, I've paid my dues, I'm a seasoned dame
So why you gotta throw salt in my game?
You hide behind the computer screen so that you don't have to be seen
How could a person be so mean?
Who are you, and what do you do?
That makes you think you're above me
But have you walked in my shoes?
The pedestal you put yourself on
Well, since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone, gone
(Gone, gone, gone)
(Gone, gone, gone, gone)
Probably one of them tag a longs
Down for the free t-shirt 'cause you're a hanger on
You think you got me figured out
Never met me, have no clue what I'm about
Maybe I got things you wish you had
You need to stop the hating, get a pen and pad
I work around the clock, so fill your mouth up with a sock
And get you head up off your jock
Tell me who you are and what your background is
Tell me how you're feeling when you listen to this (Ooh-ooh)
Dum dum, dum dum
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Tell me how you're feeling when you listen to this
You think I don't see you on the internet
I read it, don't think I won't forget (Ooh, ooh)

===== Fergie - True =====
Yeah, yeah
I know, I know (Yeah), it's true, it's true
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's true
My, my, my, my, my love is true
Huh-huh-huh, hu-uh, I know this much is true
So true, funny how it seems
Always in time, but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul, this is the sound
I know you love the way my love is soundin'
From over there, you could feel my heart poundin'
Let me swim in you, I don't mind drownin'
Forever I'll be upside down frownin'
I love you uptown, love you downtownin'
You could be my woman, and I could be your main man (Uh-huh)
And that's why I sat down and wrote this poem
'Cause I want the truth to be told
Boy, you know I know that is true
With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that just begun
Listening to Marvin (All night long)
This is the sound of my soul, this is the sound (Yo)
I like the way your soul sounds to me
Ain't nobody doing me the way you do me (Uh-uh)
I got the stamina for L-O-V-E
Whip out the camera, let's make a movie
In the future, we could look back at what we done did
We'll be makin' love 'til we like a hundred
And that's why I had to remix this song
Huh-huh-huh, hu-uh, I know this much is true (Is true, is true)
Huh-huh-huh, hu-uh, I know this much is true (I know, I know, it's true, it's true)
You know it's true
You know I love you, girl (You know it's true)
I know, I know, I know this much is true
I know you love me, girl
You know it's true (Yeah)
This much is true
You know I love you, girl

===== Barbra Streisand - Woman in Love =====
Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone, it's a lonelier place
I kissed the morning goodbye
But down inside, you know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall but I give you it all
I am a woman in love and I'd do anything
To get you into my world and hold you within
It's a right I defend over and over again
What do I do?
With you eternally mine
In love there is no measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I live in each other's heart
We may be oceans away
You feel my love, I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
Oh-ho, oh, oh, I am a woman in love and I'm talking to you
You know I know how you feel
What a woman can do

===== Barbra Streisand - Guilty =====
Shadows falling, baby, we stand alone
Out on the street anybody you meet
Got a heartache of their own (It oughta be illegal)
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad (It oughta be illegal)
You got a reason for livin'
You battle on with the love you're livin' on
You gotta be mine
We take it away
It's got to be night and day
Just a matter of time
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain near or far, we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye
Pulses racing, darling
How grand we are
Little by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark (It oughta be illegal)
Make it a crime to be out in the cold (It oughta be illegal)
You battle on with the love you're buildin' on
It's gotta be night and day
Don't wanna hear your goodbye
I don't wanna hear your
And we got nothing

===== Barbra Streisand - I Finally Found Someone =====
I finally found someone
Who knocks me off my feet
I finally found the one
Who makes me feel complete
It started over coffee
We started out as friends
It's funny how from simple things
The best things begin
This time is different la la la la
It's all because of you la la la la
It's better than it's ever been
'Cause we can talk it through
My favorite line
Was "Can I call you sometime?"
It's all you had to say
To take my breath away
This is it
Oh, I finally found someone
Someone to share my life
To be with every night
'Cause whatever I do it's just got to be you
My life has just begun, I finally found someone
Ooooh, someone
Ooooh
Did I keep you waiting? I didn't mind
I apologize Baby, that's fine
I would wait forever
Just to know you were mine
You know, I love your hair Are you sure it looks right?
I love what you wear Isn't it too tight?
You're exceptional
I can't wait for the rest of my life
Ohhhhh, I finally found someone
'Cause whatever I do It's just got to be you, Oh yeah
And whatever I do
It's just got to be you
Oooh my life has just begun

===== Barbra Streisand - The Way We Were =====
Hmmmmm hmmmmm
Hmm hmm hmmmmmm hmmm hmmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmmmm hmmmm hmmmmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmmmmmm
Hmm hmm
Memories
Light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were
Can it be that
It was all so simple then?
Or has time re-written every line?
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?
May be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter
We will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
Hmmm hmmm hmmmmm hmmmmm hmmmmmmmmmmm

===== Barbra Streisand - Evergreen (Live) =====
See the truth is that over the years when I find myself writing music, it's mostly out of necessity
If a movie I'm making needs a song, you know, I might take a stab at writing it
And that's how this one was born
Love, soft as an easy chair
I'm coming over there soon!
Love, fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you
Now, one of the most gratifying things about having written this song is hearing it sung by other artists in other languages
And who better to sing it with me tonight than my special guests, Il Divo!
Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two
You and I will make each night a first
Every day a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
'Cause we have the brightest love
Two lights that shine as one
Morning glory and the midnight sun
Time, we've learned to sail above
Time, won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever, evergreen
Il Divo!

===== Barbra Streisand - Tell Him =====
I'm scared
So afraid to show I care
Will he think me weak
If I tremble when I speak
Oooh - what if
There's another one he's thinking of
Maybe he's in love
I'd feel like a fool
Life can be so cruel
I don't know what to do
I've been there
With my heart out in my hand
But what you must understand
You can't let the chance
To love him pass you by
Tell him
Tell him that the sun and moon
Rise in his eyes
Reach out to him
And whisper
Tender words so soft and sweet
I'll hold him close to feel his heartbeat
Love will be the gift you give yourself
Touch him (Oh)
With the gentleness you feel inside (I feel it)
Your love can't be denied
The truth will set you free
You'll have what's meant to be
All in time you'll see
I love him
(Then show him)
Of that much I can be sure
(Hold him close to you)
I don't think I could endure
If I let him walk away
When I have so much to say
Hold him close to feel his heartbeat
Love is light that surely glows
In the hearts of those who know
It's a steady flame that grows
Feed the fire with all the passion you can show
Tonight, love will assume its place
This memory time cannot erase
Your faith will lead love where it has to go
Whisper words so soft and sweet
Never let him go

===== Barbra Streisand - Memory =====
Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every streetlamp seems to beat
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
And soon it will be morning
Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
A streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning
Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day
Has begun

===== Barbra Streisand - You Don't Bring Me Flowers =====
You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When I come through the door at the end of the day
I remember when
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after loving me late at night
Well, it's good for you
And you're feeling alright
Well, you just roll over and turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore
It used to be so natural
To talk about forever
But used-to-be's don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor
Till we sweep them away
And, baby, I remember
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well, I learned how to love
Even learned how to lie
So you think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye
'Cause you don't bring me flowers anymore
Well, you think I could learn
'Cause you don't say you need me
You don't bring me flowers anymore

===== Barbra Streisand - Don't Rain On My Parade =====
Just sit and putter
Life's candy and the sun's
A ball of butter
Don't bring around a cloud
To rain on my parade
Don't tell me not to fly
I've simply got to
If someone takes a spill
It's me and not you
Who told you you're allowed
To rain on my parade?!
I'll march my band out
I'll beat my drum
And if I'm fanned out
Your turn at bat, sir
At least I didn't fake it
Hat, sir, I guess I didn't make it!
But whether I'm the rose
Of sheer perfection
A freckle on the nose
Of life's complexion
The cinder or the shiny apple of its eye
I gotta fly once
I gotta try once
Only can die once, right, sir?
Ooh, life is juicy
Juicy, and you see
I gotta have my bite, sir!
Get ready for me, love
'Cause I'm a "comer"
I simply gotta march
My heart's a drummer
To rain on my parade!
I'm gonna live and live now
Get what I want—I know how
One roll for the whole shebang
One throw, that bell will go clang
Eye on the target—and wham—
One shot, one gun shot, and bam!
Hey, Mister Arnstein, here I am!
I will beat my drum
At least I didn't fake it, hat, sir
I guess I didn't make it
'Cause I'm a "comer,"
Nobody, no, nobody
Is gonna rain on my parade!

===== Barbra Streisand - What Kind of Fool =====
There was a place when we were starting over
We let the bound break
We let the heartache in
Who's sorry now?
There was a world when we were standing still
And for a moment we were separated
And then you found her
You let the stranger in
What, what kind of fool
Tears it apart
Leaving me pain and sorrow?
Losing you now
Wonderin' why
Where will I be tomorrow?
Forever more that's what we are to be
Without each other
We'll be remembering when
There was a time when we were down and out
We cried...
We lied...
Oh, losing you now
How can I win?
Was there a moment when I cut you down?
Played around?
What have I done?
I only apologize
For being, as they say, the last to know
It has to show
When someone is in your eyes
What kind of fool
Wondering why
How can I win

===== Barbra Streisand - No More Tears (Enough Is Enough) =====
Hmm, hmm-hmmm, ooh-ooh, ooh
It's raining, it's pouring
My love life is boring me to tears
After all these years
No sunshine, no moonlight
No stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance
I've always dreamed I'd find the perfect lover
But he turned out to be lLike every other man
I've loved, I've loved
Raining (Raining)
Pouring (Pouring)
There's nothing left for us here Mm-mm, hmm-mmm
And we won't waste another tear Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff
Don't you do it
If you've had your fill, get the check, pay the bill
You can do it
Tell him to just get out
Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat, show him out
Just look him in the eye and simply shout
Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough is enough, I want him out
I want him out that door now
I always dreamed I'd found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
I've loved I had no choice from the start loved
I've loved I've gotta listen to my heart
I've loved Tearing us apart I've loved
Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more, no
I want him out, I want him out that door now
Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister
Goodbye sugar
No more tears
No more tears No more tears
Tears No more tears tears
I've had it, you've had it No more tears she's had it, we've had it
Is enough is enough
Is enough is enough!

===== Barbra Streisand - It Had to Be You =====
Could be, should be making me glad
Why am I blue?
It's up to you to explain
I'm thinking maybe, baby, I'll go away
Someday, some way, you'll come and say it's you I need
And you'll be pleading in vain
It had to be you, had to be you
I wandered around, and finally found somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue
And even be glad just to be sad
Thinking of you
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean, might never be cross
I tried to be boss, but they wouldn't do
'Cause nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults I love you still
Had to be you, crazy old you, had to be you

===== Barbra Streisand - Papa, Can You Hear Me? =====
Oh, God and my father
Who is also in Heaven
May the light
Of this flickering candle
Illuminate the night the way
Your spirit illuminates my soul
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa, can you find me in the night?
Papa, are you near me?
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?
Looking at the skies
I seem to see a million eyes
Which ones are yours?
Where are you now that yesterday
Has waved goodbye
And closed its doors?
The night is so much darker
The wind is so much colder
The world I see is so much bigger
Now that I'm alone
Papa, please forgive me
Try to understand me
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?
Can you hear me praying?
Anything I'm saying
Even though the night is filled with voices?
I remember everything you taught me
Every book I've ever read
Can all the words in all the books
Help me to face what lies ahead?
The trees are so much taller
And I feel so much smaller
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright
Papa, how I love you
Papa, how I need you
Papa, how I miss you
Kissing me goodnight

===== Barbra Streisand - Send in the Clowns =====
Isn't it rich?
Aren't we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground
You in mid-air
Send in the clowns
Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around
One who can't move
Where are the clowns?
Just when I'd stopped opening doors
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there
Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear
I thought that you'd want what I want
Sorry, my dear
But where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns
Quick, send in the clowns
What a surprise!
Who could foresee
I've come to feel about you
What you felt about me?
Why only now when I see
That you've drifted away?
What a surprise
What a cliché
Isn't it queer
Losing my timing this late
In my career?
And where are the clowns?
Don't bother, they're here

===== Barbra Streisand - Till I Loved You =====
Till I loved you
Every sky ever gray, never blue
You were my friend, good friend
And sometimes I would wonder
Could the one to save me
Possibly be you?
I was lost, I was blind
Wouldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You were my friend, dear friend
I held you close to my heart
But I never thought that I'd feel the way I do
Until that certain moment when I loved you
And now I can't ever imagine
My living without you
It seems I spend all of my time
Thinking only about you
Once I dreamed in a dream I would find you
Never thought that the dream would come true
Until that curtain lifted, parted, drifted from you
Until that certain moment
Certain moment when I loved you
When I loved you
Nothing lived, nothing grew
Empty days, empty nights
Sometimes I wonder
Could the one to save me possibly be you?
Ooooohh I was lost, I was blind till I found you
Couldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You came along, stole my heart completely
And I thought, could the one to save me possibly be you?

===== Barbra Streisand - My Man =====
Oh, my man, I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright, alright
What's the difference if I say "I'll go away"
When I know I'll come back on my knees someday
For whatever my man is, I am his
Forever more
It cost me a lot but that's one thing that I've got
It's my man
Cold and wet tired you bet
But all that I soon forget, with my man
He's not much for looks
And no hero out of books, he's my man
Two or three girls has he
That he likes as well as me but I love him
Oh my man I love him so, he'll never know
All my life is just despair but I don't care

===== Barbra Streisand - Somewhere =====
Somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us, somewhere
There's a time for us
Some day there'll be a time for us
Time together with time to spare
Time to learn
Time to care
Some day
We'll find there's a way of forgiving
Somewhere (Somewhere, somewhere)
A time and a place for us
Hold my hand and we're halfway there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow
Somewhere!

===== Barbra Streisand - Promises =====
Here by my side
Are you close enough to take me to your paradise
Or am I going down to my loneliness
Could you be loving me more or less
Do you know
Are you ready for the feeling
Can you learn to grow
Out in a world of tears
We were hanging on
We come together
We find the sun
You all over me, all over
You're the light
I am the love don't let me die away
I am forever we are born to make
Promises to be there
Life, where the few may not ever find a heaven
I could be with you
Out in a world where nights
They don't ever end
We've got each other my love
My life, my friend
Promises to love me
They don't ever ever end
Yeah...yeah...yeah
(Die away)
Promises...
(promises to be there
Promises to be there)
Promises
Promises...aaaah!

===== Barbra Streisand - New York State of Mind =====
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
But I'm takin' a Greyhound
On the Hudson River line
I'm in a New York state of mind
Seen all those movie stars
And their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockies, under the evergreens
But I know what I'm needin'
And I don't wanna waste more time
It was so easy livin' day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times and the Daily News
Comes down to reality
And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or up on Riverside
I don't have any reasons
I've left them all behind
Cause left them all behind
I'm in a New York, I'm in a New York state of mind...

===== Barbra Streisand - My Heart Belongs to Me =====
I got the feelin' the feelin's gone
My heart has gone to sleep
One of these mornin's I'll be gone
My heart belongs to me
Can we believe in fairytales?
Can love survive when all else fails?
Can't hide the feelin' the feelin's gone
But now my love, hey didn't I love you
But we knew what had to be
Somehow my love, I'll always love you
But my heart belongs to me
Put out the light and close your eyes
Come lie beside me
Don't ask why
Didn't I love you
Didn't I love you, baby
Don't cry my love
I'll always love you
(Didn't I love you, didn't I love you)

===== Sting - Fields Of Gold =====
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we walk in fields of gold
So she took her love for to gaze awhile
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold
Will you stay with me? Will you be my love?
Among the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we lie in fields of gold
See the west wind move like a lover so
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
Many years have passed since those summer days
See the children run as the sun goes down
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold

===== Sting - Englishman In New York =====
I don't drink coffee, I'll take tea my dear
I like my toast done on one side
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk
I'm an Englishman in New York
See me walking down Fifth Avenue
A walking cane here at my side
I take it everywhere I walk
Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
If "manners maketh man" as someone said
Then he's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself, no matter what they say
Modesty, propriety, can lead to notoriety
You could end up as the only one
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
At night a candle's brighter than the sun
Takes more than combat gear to make a man
Takes more than a license for a gun
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
A gentleman will walk but never run
(Be yourself, no matter what they say)

===== Sting - Shape Of My Heart =====
He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
He doesn't play for respect
He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart
He may play the jack of diamonds
He may lay the queen of spades
He may conceal a king in his hand
While a memory of it fades
That's not the shape, shape of my heart
​​
And if I told you that I loved you
You'd maybe think there's something wrong
I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask I wear is one
But those who speak know nothing
And find out to their cost
Like those who curse their luck in too many places
And those who fear are lost
That's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape, the shape of my heart

===== Sting - Desert Rose =====
Layli, layli, oh
Hathe mada tawila
Wa ana nahos ana wahala ghzalti
I dream of rain, ya leil, ya leil
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain, ya leil, ya leil
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire, ya leil, ya leil
Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames, ya leil, ya leil
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire
This desert rose, ya leil, ya leil
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower, ya leil, ya leil
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
And as she turns, ya leil, ya leil
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns, ya leil, ya leil
I realize that nothing's as it seems
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes, ya leil, ya leil
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love
Aman, aman, aman
Omry feek antia
Ma ghair antia
Sweet desert rose, ya leil, ya leil
Sweet desert rose
This memory of Eden haunts us all
This rare perfume, is the sweet intoxication of the fall
Layli, oh-oh, layli, layli, ah-ah-ah

===== Sting - Fragile =====
If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
Drying in the color of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay
Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are
On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say
How fragile we are how fragile we are

===== Sting - What Could Have Been =====
I am the monster you created
You ripped out all my parts
And worst of all, for me to live, I gotta kill the part of me that saw
That I needed you more
I hope you know we had everything
And you broke me and left these pieces
I want you to hurt like you hurt me today and
I want you to lose like I lose when I play
What could have been
Oh, what could have been
Why don't you love who I am?
What we could have been
I am your ghost, a fallen angel
I couldn't care what invention you made me
'Cause I, I was meant to be yours
I want you to lose like I lose when I play—

===== Sting - It's Probably Me =====
If the night turned cold and the stars looked down
And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground
You wake the morning in a stranger's coat
No one would you see
You ask yourself, who's watched for me
My only friend, who could it be
It's hard to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me
When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the city for your only friend
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free
I had to say it
You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way
You'll only make me cry
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I Hate to say It
When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
And the jury's out and your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see
I Hate to say it
I hate to say it

===== Sting - If I Ever Lose My Faith In You =====
You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
You could say I lost my belief in the holy church
You would say I lost my sense of direction
Yes, you could say all of this and worse but
If I ever lose my faith in you
There'd be nothing left for me to do
Some would say I was a lost man in a lost world
You could say I lost my faith in the people on TV
You would say I lost my belief in our politicians
They all seem like game show hosts to me
I could be lost inside their lies without a trace
But every time I close my eyes I see your face
I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a - a blessing to a curse
I never saw no military solution
That didn't always end up as something worse but
Let me say this first
(If I ever lose my faith in you)
(There'd be nothing left for me to do)
If I ever lose my faith
In you

===== Sting - Morning Is Coming =====
It's a beautiful day
For me to rock around your way
Only when I see Sting
Sweet nightingale
Why do you wake me so?
You're telling me something I don't know
It's quarter to three
Your singing, driving me right out of my tree
I'm so tired that I could weep
When all the other birdies are still fast asleep, yeah
Morning is coming
Morning is on its way
It's revelation day
Sweet Nightingale
We'll talk it over in the light of day
Why can't it wait?
I need my beauty sleep, whatever you say
Wake up, it's a beautiful day
Wake up, don't you hear what I say?
'Cause I be rocking in my shoes to this sweet reggae groove
Ain't nobody gonna spoil my mood
To this beautiful sunshine, I'm rising up
Just a positive vibe mi use and build me up
Overflowing like di hot coffee inna me cup
Ain't no time for easing up, yeah
Oh, nightingale
You broke a dream where I don't live on my own
I look around but there's nobody home
Rouse yourself and get out of bed (Uh-huh)
And drag your comb across your sleepy head
Clean your teeth and wash your face
Look like you're a member of the human race
Wake up, don't you hear what I say
Now, mi say, morning time back to evening time
Dis a message wha mi use to uplift mankind
Whether you know how fi bubble or you know how fi whine
"Enjoy, it's a beautiful time"
Oh, morning is coming

===== Sting - Don't Make Me Wait =====
Don't make me wait
Don't make me wait in vain, to love you
Can't wait to give you me last name
Don't make me wait, don't make me too long girl
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
To love, to love you, to love you
A wah mi say
It didn't take me long to fall in love with your mind
And I won't even mention the way your body perfectly design, so fine
And judging from your outlook on life, I knew this would be more than just one night
But now I'm ready for the next level and you're telling me you need more time, no crime
Nothing wrong with waiting a little bit, yuh know this is more to me than just hittin' it
But only get a love like this once inna life time and if this is our chance I ain't missing it
My whole life I never felt like this, just wanna run with it I don't wanna fight this
I ain't rushing yuh to make up yo mind, just wanna put some more quality in a we time
Come on, girl
To love, to love, to love you
I can't wait no fi love ya
I don't want you to think I'm rushing you
I know you like to take your time (time, time, time)
I'm already sold by the idea, of you and I
Just tell me where I need to sign (sign, sign, sign)
'Cause I've been searching for a while, girl
And I know what works for me (oh, oh)
All I need to know if this is what you want, girl
'Cause I'm already where I need to be, so don't make me wait
I can't wait no longer
Fi wah
You don't wanna rush and I don't wanna take my time
I'm putting everything on the line
They say that true love's hard to find
I'm ready now to make you mine
Baby, now, baby, now, don't make me wait
You gotta say yeah, yeah, yeah

===== Sting - Russians =====
In Europe and America
There's a growing feeling of hysteria
Conditioned to respond to all the threats
In the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets
Mr. Khrushchev said, "We will bury you"
I don't subscribe to this point of view
It would be such an ignorant thing to do
If the Russians love their children too
How can I save my little boy
From Oppenheimer's deadly toy?
There is no monopoly of common sense
On either side of the political fence
We share the same biology
Regardless of ideology
Believe me when I say to you
I hope the Russians love their children too
There is no historical precedent
To put the words in the mouth of the president
There's no such thing as a winnable war
It's a lie we don't believe anymore
Mr. Reagan says, "We will protect you"
What might save us, me and you
Is if the Russians love their children too

===== Sting - If You Love Somebody Set Them Free =====
Free, free, set them free (Oh, whoa, whoa)
Free, free, set them free (Oh)
Free, free, set them free
If you need somebody (Free, free, set them free)
Call my name (Free, free, set them free)
If you want someone (Free, free, set them free)
You can do the same (Free, free, set them free)
If you wanna keep something precious (Free, free, set them free)
You gotta lock it up and throw away the key (Free, free, set them free)
If you wanna hold onto your possession (Free, free, set them free)
Don't even think about me (Free, free, set them free)
If you love somebody
If you love someone
If you love someone, set them free (Free, free, set them free)
Set them free (Free, free, set them free)
If it's a mirror you want
Just look into my eyes
Or a whipping boy, someone to despise
Or a prisoner in the dark
Tied up in chains you just can't see
Or a beast in a gilded cage
That's all some people ever wanna be
If you love somebody (Love somebody)
If you love someone (Love somebody)
You can't control an independent heart
(Can't hold what you can't keep)
Can't tear the one you love apart
(Can't love what you can't keep)
Forever conditioned to believe that we can't live
We can't live here and be happy with less
So many riches, so many souls
Everything we see there, we want to possess
If you need somebody, call my name
If you want someone
You can do, you can do, you can do the same
If you wanna keep something precious
You gotta lock it up and throw away the key
You wanna hold onto your possession
Don't even think about me
Set them free (Free, free, set them free, oh)

===== Sting - Seven Days =====
"Seven Days" was all she wrote
A kind of ultimatum note
She gave to me, she gave to me
When I thought the field had cleared
It seems another suit appeared
To challenge me, woe is me
Though I hate to make a choice
My options are decreasing mostly rapidly
Well we'll see
I don't think she'd bluff this time
I really have to make her mine
It's plain to see
It's him or me
Monday, I could wait till Tuesday
If I make up my mind
Wednesday would be fine
Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time
Saturday could wait
But Sunday'd be too late
The fact he's over six feet ten
Might instill fear in other men
But not in me
The mighty flea
Ask if I am mouse or man
The mirror squeaked, away I ran
He'll murder me
In time for his tea
Does it bother me at all
My rival is Neanderthal
It makes me think
Perhaps I need a drink
IQ is no problem here
We won't be playing Scrabble for
Her hand I fear
I need that beer
Seven days will quickly go
The fact remains, I love her so
Seven days, so many ways
But I can't run away
I can't run away
Wednesday would be fine, Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time, Saturday could wait
(Sunday'd be too late)
Sunday'd be too late
Do I have to tell a story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

===== Sting - Mad About You =====
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you
And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient songs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer?
How much longer?
They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no victories
In all our histories, without love
A stone's throw from Jerusalem
And through a million stars were shining
And though you hold the keys to ruin
Of everything I see

===== Sting - Brand New Day =====
How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair
And how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights
How many lies, how many fights
And why would you want to put yourself through all that again?
"Love is pain," I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day
You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero, sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
Starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across
Started up a brand new day
It could happen to you - just like it happened to me
There's simply no immunity - there's no guarantee
I say love's such a force - if you find yourself in it
And sometimes no reflection is there
Baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
I’ll sell the stock, we’ll spend all the money
We’re starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, Mac
I begging her to take me back
I’m thinking in a brand new way
The river’s wide, we’ll swim across
Turn the clock to zero, buddy
Don’t wanna be no fuddy-duddy
I'm the rhythm in your tune
I'm the sun and you're the moon
I'm a bat and you're the cave
You're the beach and I'm the wave
I’m the plow and you’re the land
You're the glove and I'm the hand
I'm the train and you're the station
I'm a flagpole to your nation - yeah
I’m the present to your future
You’re the wound and I’m the suture
You’re the magnet to my pole
I’m the devil in your soul
You’re the pupil, I’m the teacher
You’re the church and I’m the preacher
You’re the flower, I’m the rain
You’re the tunnel, I’m the train
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
You’re the crop to my rotation
You’re the sum of my equation
I’m the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
We’ll go up instead of down
You’re the stair and I’m the handle
You’re the flame and I’m the candle
It's a brand new day

===== Sting - All This Time =====
I looked out across the river today
Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light
Two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night
All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
Two priests came 'round our house tonight
One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea
Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle
As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing
What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?
Endlessly like a silent tear
Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?
Teachers told the Romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town
They lived and they died
They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found
In the falling light of a Northern sun
If I had my way, take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in congregations, they only get better one by one
One by one

===== Sting - Just One Lifetime =====
The time has come, the Walrus said
To talk of many things
Of ships and shoes and sealing wax
Of cabbages and kings
Life a the greatest gift given to humanity
Surround yourself with a lot a positive energy
Yuh can't buy it even if yuh have whole heap a money
And dat's why we spread love ina the community
Yuh coulda be small man or a celebrity
Yuh coulda live uptown or di inner city
We need a world full peace and serenity
Sting come sing out fi everybody
The time has come, as Shaggy said
The planets turn in retrograde
The moon seems to have fled
The world is spinning upside down
And landed on its head
Just one lifetime
And there's only one, yes there's only one
Just one life to live
Assuming that we'll make it
We've no choice but to take it
I'm with you, the Walrus said
We'll dress for heavy weather
Whatever's on the road ahead
We're in this now together
We thought we'd make a run for it
Not knowing where we're headed
We packed the car with both our bags
And filled her up unleaded
Come make we take a page out a di book of life
Leggo negativity and do what's right
We no longer need fi a fuss or fight
Unite the world and show dem di right
Dis generation a set a new trend
Replace di word enemy wid friend
Leaders a di world these rules can't bend
Dis a di message we a send to dem
The time had come, a reckoning
We all knew it was coming
We headed North on empty roads
The engine gently humming
The Walrus smoked a cigarette
He claimed it was his last
No signs of life, no gas, no food
In all the empty towns we passed
All we have is me and you
It has to be enough
I've got your back and you've got mine
If the going it gets rough

===== Sting - A Thousand Years =====
A thousand years, a thousand more
A thousand times a million doors to eternity
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
An endless turning stairway climbs
To a tower of souls
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars
The towers rise to numberless floors in space
I could shed another million tears, a million breaths
A million names but only one truth to face
A million roads, a million fears
A million suns, ten million years of uncertainty
I could speak a million lies, a million songs
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
But if there was a single truth, a single light
A single thought, a singular touch of grace
Then following this single point, this single flame
The single haunted memory of your face
I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head
I may be numberless, I may be innocent
I may know many things, I may be ignorant
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief
I've kept this single faith, I have but one belief
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves
Eternities still unsaid
'Til you love me

===== Sting - Moon Over Bourbon Street =====
There's a moon over Bourbon Street tonight
I see faces as they pass
Beneath the pale lamplight
I've no choice but to follow that call
The bright lights, the people
And the moon and all
I pray everyday to be strong
For I know what I do must be wrong
Oh you'll never see my shade
Or hear the sound of my feet
While there's a moon over Bourbon Street
It was many years ago
That I became what I am
I was trapped in this life
Like an innocent lamb
Now I can never show my face at noon
And you'll only see me walking
By the light of the moon
The brim of my hat
Hides the eye of a beast
I've the face of a sinner
But the hands of a priest
She walks everyday through
The streets of New Orleans
She's innocent and young
From a family of means
I have stood many times
Outside her window at night
To struggle with my instinct
In the pale moon light
How could I be this way
When I pray to god above
I must love what I destroy
And destroy the thing I love

===== Sting - Practical Arrangement =====
Am I asking for the moon?
Is it really so implausible?
That you and I could soon
Come to some kind of arrangement?
I'm not asking for the moon
I've always been a realist
When it's really nothing more
Than a simple rearrangement
With one roof above our heads
A warm house to return to
We could start with separate beds
I could sleep alone or learn to
I'm not suggesting that we'd find
Some earthly paradise forever
I mean, how often does that happen now?
The answer's probably never
But we could come to an arrangement
A practical arrangement
And you could learn to love me
Given time
I'm not promising the moon
I'm not promising a rainbow
Just a practical solution
To a solitary life
I'd be a father to your boy
A shoulder you could lean on
How bad could it be
To be my wife?
You wouldn't have to cook for me
You wouldn't have to learn to
I'm not suggesting that this proposition here
Could last forever
I've no intention of deceiving you
You're far too clever
And perhaps you'd learn to love me
It may not be the romance
That you had in mind
But you could learn to love me

===== Blondie - Call Me =====
Color me your color, baby, color me your car

===== Blondie - One Way Or Another =====
One way or another, I'm gonna find ya
I'm gonna get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another I'm gonna win ya
One way or another I'm gonna see ya
I'm gonna meet ya, meet ya, meet ya, meet ya
One day, maybe next week, I'm gonna meet ya
I'm gonna meet ya, I'll meet ya
I will drive past your house
And if the lights are all down
I'll see who's around
One way or another, I'm gonna win ya
I'll get ya, I'll get ya
One way or another, I'm gonna see ya
I'll meet ya
And if the lights are all out
I'll follow your bus downtown
See who's hangin' 'round
One way or another, I'm gonna lose ya
I'm gonna give you the slip
A slip of the hip or another, I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna trick ya, I'll trick ya
I'm gonna trick ya, trick ya, trick ya, trick ya
I'll walk down the mall, stand over by the wall
Where I can see it all, find out who you call
Lead you to the supermarket checkout
Some specials and rat food, get lost in the crowd
One way or another I'm gonna get ya
(Where I can see it all, find out who you call)
I'll get ya, I'll get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya
One way or another–

===== Blondie - Heart Of Glass =====
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind
In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You're teasing like you do
Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising, yeah
Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Seemed like the real thing only to find

===== Blondie - Maria =====
She moves like she don't care
Smooth as silk, cool as air
Ooh, it makes you wanna cry
She doesn't know your name
And your heart beats like a subway train
Ooh, it makes you wanna die
Ooh, don't you wanna take her?
You wanna make her all your own?
Maria
You've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Latina
Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
I've seen this thing before
In my best friend and the boy next door
Fool for love and fool on fire
Won't come in from the rain
She's oceans running down the drain
Blue as ice and desire
Don't you wanna make her?
Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?
Ooh, don't you wanna break her?
She walks like she don't care
You want to take her everywhere
She's like a millionaire
Walking on imported air
A million and one...

===== Blondie - The Tide Is High =====
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kind-a girl who gives up just like that, oh no
It's not the things you do that tease and hurt me bad
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm gonna be your number one, number one
Every girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear 'till it's my turn
I'm gonna be your number one, number one, number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on

===== Blondie - Atomic =====
Uh-huh, make me tonight, tonight, make it right
Uh-huh, make me tonight, tonight, tonight
Oh, uh-huh, make it magnificent, tonight, right
Oh, your hair is beautiful, oh, tonight
Atomic
Tonight, make it magnificent, tonight, make me tonight
Your hair is beautiful, oh, tonight
Oh, oh, atomic
Oh, oh

===== Blondie - Rapture =====
Toe to toe, dancing very close
Barely breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture
Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face, sightless solitude
And it's finger popping
24-hour shopping in rapture
Fab 5 Freddy told me everybody's fly
DJ spinnin' I said, "My My"
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
France Soir c'est pas Flash et Nous Deux
François c'est pas, Flash ain't no dude
And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe to toe, don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eatin' bars, yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rap-ture, be pure
Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
Said don't stop to punk rock
Man to man, body muscular
Seismic decibel, bite the jugular
Wall to wall, tea time technology
And a digital ladder
No sign of bad luck in rapture
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars
Won't eat up bars where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars
And eatin' bars and now he only eats guitars, get up

===== Blondie - Hanging On The Telephone =====
I'm in the phone booth, it's the one across the hall
If you don't answer, I'll just ring it off the wall
I know he's there, but I just had to call
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone
I heard your mother, now she's going out the door
Did she go to work or just go to the store?
All those things she said, I told you to ignore
Oh, why can't we talk again?
It's good to hear your voice, you know it's been so long
If I don't get your calls, then everything goes wrong
I want to tell you something you've known all along
I had to interrupt and stop this conversation
Your voice across the line gives me a strange sensation
I'd like to talk when I can show you my affection
Oh, I can't control myself
Hang up and run to me (oh)
Hang up and run to me
Oh, woah, woah, woah
Run to me, yeah

===== Blondie - Dreaming =====
When I met you in the restaurant
You could tell I was no debutante
You asked me what's my pleasure
A movie or a measure?
I'll have a cup of tea and tell you of my
Dreaming, dreaming is free
I don't want to live on charity
Pleasure's real or is it fantasy?
Reel to reel is living rarity
People stop and stare at me
We just walk on by, we just keep on dreaming
Feet, feet walking a two mile
Meet, meet, meet me at the turnstile
I never met him, I'll never forget him
Dream, dream, even for a little while
Dream, dream, filling up an idle hour
Fade away, radiate
I sit by and watch the river flow
I sit by and watch the traffic go
Imagine something of your very own
Something you can have and hold
I'd build a road in gold just to have some
Dreaming is free

===== Blondie - Sunday Girl =====
I know a girl from a lonely street
Cold as ice cream but still as sweet
Dry your eyes, Sunday Girl
Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide, Sunday Girl
Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your loving means to me
She can't catch up with the working crowd
The weekend mood and she's feeling proud
Live in dreams, Sunday Girl
Baby, I would like to go out tonight
If I go with you my folks'll get uptight
Stay at home, Sunday Girl
Ooh
When I saw you again in the summertime
If your love was as sweet as mine
I could be Sunday's girl
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up and wait
I got the blues, please, please
Please come see what'cha do to me
I got the blues
Hurry up, please come see what'cha do to me

===== Blondie - Denis =====
Oh Denis doo-be-do
I'm in love with you, Denis doo-be-do
I'm in love with you
Denis Denis, oh with your eyes so blue
Denis Denis, I've got a crush on you
Denis Denis, I'm so in love with you
Oh when we walk it always feels so nice
And when we talk it seems like paradise
Denis Denis I'm so in love with you
You're my king and I'm in heaven every time I look at you
When you smile it's like a dream
And I'm so lucky cause I found a boy like you
Denis Denis
Avec tes yeux si bleus
Quand j'ai peche' pour deux
Pour un baiser d'eternité
Je suis folle de toi
Embrasse moi ce soir
Pour un baiser d'eternite

===== Blondie - Once I Had A Love (AKA The Disco Song) =====
Soon turned out to be a thing of the past
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
Once I had a love and it was divine
Soon found out I was losin' my mind
Seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
In between
What I find is pleasin' and I'm feelin' fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losin' you, it's just no good
You teasin' like you do
Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass
Lost inside
Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're usin', please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruisin', yeah
Ridin' high
On love's true bluish lie
Ooh, oh
Ooh, ah
Once I had a love I thought was a gas

===== Blondie - Picture This =====
All I want is a room with a view
A sight worth seeing, a vision of you
All I want is a room with view, oh-oh
I will give you my finest hour
The one I spent watching you shower
I will give you my finest hour, oh yeah
All I want is a photo in my wallet
A small remembrance of something more solid
All I want is a picture of you
Picture this - a day in December
Picture this - freezing cold weather
You got clouds on your lids and you'd be on the skids
If it weren't for your job at the garage
If you could only oh-oh
Picture this - a sky full of thunder
Picture this - my telephone number
One and one is what I'm telling you, oh yeah
All I want is 20-20 vision
A total portrait with no omissions
All I want is a vision of you, oh-oh
If you can picture this - a day in December
One and one is what I'm telling you
Get a pocket computer
Try to do what you used to do yeah

===== Blondie - Long Time =====
I've been running circles 'round a night that never ends
I've been chasing heartache, in a city and a friend
I've been with you so long, even seen you lose it, but, who cares?
Racing down the bowery, on a crowded afternoon
Dripping from the downpour of your insecure typhoon
Can you even want me, or this is just a way to keep you safe?
Take me, then lose me, then tell them I'm yours
Are you, happy?
Does it take you a long time?
Does it make you upset?
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend?
I can give you a heartbeat, I can give you a friend
I can make you think, everybody wants to be your friend
Drinking with your cell phone with a smile on your face
Happy in success, but still a thousand miles away
Is this what you wanted, is this everything you had in store?
I can give you a heartbeat, i can give you a friend
I've been running circles round a night that never ends
Does it take you a long time
Does it make you upset
Does it make you think everybody wants to be your friend
Take me, then lose me, then tell them Im yours

===== Blondie - Union City Blue =====
Oh, oh, what are we going to do?
Union, Union, Union City blue
Tunnel to the other side
It becomes daylight
I say, "He's mine"
Oh, power, passion plays a double hand
Union, Union, Union City man
Arrive, climb up four flights
To the orange side
Rearrange my mind
In turquoise Union, Union, Union City blue
Skyline, passion, Union City blue
Power, passion plays a double hand
I say, "He's mine, I have a plan"
I say, "He's my Union City man"

===== Blondie - Rip Her To Shreds =====
Hey, psst-psst, here she comes now
Oh, you know her
Would you look at that hair?
Yeah, you know her
Check out those shoes
She looks like she stepped out of the middle of somebody's blues
She looks like the Sunday comics
She thinks she's Brenda Starr
Her nose job is real atomic
All she needs is an old knife scar
Ew, she's so dull
Come on, rip her to shreds
She's so dull
Oh, you know her, "Miss Groupie Supreme"
Yeah, you know her, "Vera Vogue" on parade
Red eye shadow, green mascara
Bleh, she's too much
She looks like she don't know better
A case of partial extreme
Dressed in a Robert Hall sweater
Acting like a soap opera queen
Yeah, she's so dull
She got the nerve to tell me she's not on it
But her expression is too serene
Yeah, she looks like she washes with Comet
Always lookin' to create a scene
Rip her to shreds
Yeah, you know her, with the fish-eatin' grin
Yeah, she got the nerve to tell me
Huh, she's so dull
Hey, there she goes now
She makin' out with King Kong
She take her boat to Hong Kong
Well, bye-bye, sugar
And not a minute too soon

===== Blondie - X Offender =====
I saw you standing on the corner
You looked so big and fine
I really wanted to go out with you
So when you smiled
I laid my heart on the line
You read me my rights
And then you said
"Let's go" and nothing more
I thought of my nights
And how they were
They were filled with
I know you wouldn't go
You'd watch my heart burst
Then you'd step in
I had to know so I asked
You just had to laugh
We sat in the night
With my hands cuffed at my side
I look at your life and your style
I wanted nothing more
Walking the line, you were a marksman
Told me that law, like wine, is ageless
Public defender
You had to admit
You wanted the love of a sex offender
My vision in blue
I call you from inside my cell
And in the trial, you were there
With your badge and rubber boots
I think all the time how I'm going to
Perpetrate love with you
And when I get out, there's no doubt
I'll be sex offensive to you
Ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

===== Blondie - In The Flesh =====
Darling, darling, darling
I can't wait to see you
Your picture ain't enough
I can't wait to touch you in the flesh (Ooh)
Darling, darling, darling (Darling)
I can't wait to hear you
Remembering your love (Ooh)
Is nothing without you in the flesh
Went walking one day on the lower East side
Met you with a girlfriend, you were so divine
She said, "Hands off this one sweetie, this boy is mine"
I couldn't resist you, I'm not deaf, dumb, and blind
Now you're out of town
Those girls that you run with (Ooh)
They bring my head down
Ooh, darling (Darling) darling (Darling)
Watch out if I see you
'Cause if you say, "Hello"
It'll mean you want to see me in the flesh
Ooh, warm and soft, in the flesh
Ooh, close and hot, in the flesh
Ooh

===== Blondie - (I'm Always Touched By Your) Presence, Dear =====
Was it destiny
I don't know yet
Was it just by chance? Could this be Kismet?
Something in my consciousness told me you'd appear
Now I'm always touched by your presence dear
When we play at cards you use an extra sense (it's really not cheating)
You can read my hand, I've got no defense
When you sent your messages whispered loud and clear
I am always touched by your presence dear
Floating past the evidence of possibilities
We could navigate together, psychic frequencies
Coming into contact with outer entities
We could entertain each one with our theosophies
Stay awake at night and count your R.E.M.'s when you're talking with your super friends
Levitating lovers in the secret stratosphere
I am still in touch with your presence dear
I am still in touch with your presence dear, dear, dear, dear, dear

===== Blondie - Fade Away And Radiate =====
Ooh, baby, I hear how you spend night time
Wrapped like candy in a blue, blue neon glow
Fade away and radiate
Fade away, radiate
Ooh, baby, watchful lines
Vibrate soft in brainwave time
Silver pictures move so slow
Golden tubes faintly glow
Electric faces seem to merge
Hidden voices mock your words
Beams become my dream
My dream is on the screen
The beams become my dream
Dusty frames that still arrive
Die in 1955

===== Lizzo - Truth Hurts =====
Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo!
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)
Best friend sat me down in the salon chair (Down in the salon chair)
Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (With the bomb lighting)
New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick

Please step away from the Bentley
You're either not with me or with me
The fye close by like it's Whitney
Stay in your lane, don't tempt me
Mr. Bust-A-Whole-Clip-'Til-It's-Empty
I got a feelin' that tonight's gonna be a good night
Like Ferg and them said, God willing
Fire chains on like burr (Burr)
Feelin' like rockin' my fur (Fur)
Rolls Royce with the chauffeur (Huh?)
How your toes feel on a mink fur?
It's Gucci
Cry 'cause I want to
Smile if I want to, huh
Yes, I can
Love 'cause I want to
Get so mad I could scream (I could scream)
I could scream (I could scream)
I could scream (Sing it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's exactly how I feel (How I feel)

===== Lizzo - Jerome =====
Woo, oh
Here we go again
Uh-uh, hee-hee
Uh, look, listen, shut up
Jerome, Jerome
Take your ass home
And come back when you're grown
Go on, take your ass home
Where the peaches have thorns, ooh
Poor little baby
Who told you that you stood a chance with this royalty?
You're so sweet, bless your heart
Can't let a pretty face distract me from business
And God as my witness, your ugly ass won't either
I'm sorry, 2 AM photos with smileys and hearts
Ain't the way to my juicy parts
Boy, thank me later, looks good on paper
But love isn't easy, so I'll do the hardest part
Jerome, ooh, Jerome
Where the peaches have thorns
I never said I was perfect
Or you don't deserve a good person to carry your baggage
I know a few girls that can handle it
I ain't that kind of chick, but I can call 'em for you if you want
I never said that you wasn't attractive
Your style and that beard, ooh, don't get me distracted
I'm tryna be patient, and patience takes practice
The fact is I'm leaving, so just let me have this
And come back when you're grown, oh
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee
(Don't cry for me, baby)
(Oh, don't cry for me, baby)
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee

===== Lizzo - Scuse Me =====
Look up in the mirror, oh my God, it's me

Coconut and rose in my skin regime
Mirror, mirror on the wall, tell me what you see
It's that, oh my God, it's lookin' heavenly (Ooh)
Poppin' Power Rangers, purple, yellow, pink
Throwin' ones, wonder what my mama think
Feelin' like a stripper when I'm lookin' in the mirror
I'll be slappin' on that ass, gettin' thicker and thicker (Ooh)
I don't see nobody else (Ooh)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
'Scuse me while I feel myself (Hoo-hoo-hoo, ooh)
Look up in the mirror, oh, I'm having visions
Feelin' like a million, ooh, I can get it (Aah)

Lookin' good (Aah), feelin' yourself
It's that, oh my God, it's looking heavenly (Ooh)

===== One Direction - Night Changes =====
Goin' out tonight, changes into somethin' red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showin' off
Drivin' too fast, moon is breakin' through her hair
She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants
(Ooh) We're only gettin' older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinkin' about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearin' when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothin' to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change me and you
Chasin' her tonight, doubts are runnin' round her head
He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's fallin', doesn't even know it yet
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh
Reminds her of the missin' piece of innocence she lost
(Ooh) It will never change, baby

===== One Direction - Story of My Life =====
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open, but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the mornin' she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die, these words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
The ground beneath my feet is open wide (Oh-oh-oh)
The way that I've been holding on too tight (Oh-oh-oh)
With nothing in between
The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open, but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the mornin', I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright (Oh-oh-oh)
The way that I've been holding on so tight (Oh-oh-oh)
And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you is like chasin' the clouds
And time is frozen
The story of my life, I give her hope (I give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broke inside ('Til she's broke inside)
The story of my life

===== One Direction - What Makes You Beautiful =====
You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turnin' heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up (Huh)
Bein' the way that you are is enough
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful
So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else ('Body else)
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Oh)
Na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na
Na, na-na-na, na-na

You'll understand why I want you so desperately (Desperately)
You don't know (Don't know), oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
You don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh

===== One Direction - Drag Me Down =====
I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul, and baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason
If I didn't have you, there would be nothing left
The shell of a man that could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody (Hey)
​Nobody can drag me down​
​Nobody can drag me down
If I didn't have you, there would be nothing left (Nothing left)

​All my life, you stood by me
With your love, nobody can drag me down (Nobody can drag me down)
​Nobody can drag me down​, yeah

===== One Direction - Perfect =====
I might never be your knight in shinin' armour
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight
When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreamin' about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time
And if you like cameras flashin' every time we go out
Oh, yeah
And if you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about
Then baby, I'm perfect
And baby, we're perfect
If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms

===== One Direction - Steal My Girl =====
She been my queen since we were sixteen
We want the same things, we dream the same dreams
Alright, alright
I got it all 'cause she is the one
Her mum calls me "Love," her dad calls me "Son"
I know, I know, I know for sure
Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Oh, yeah)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Alright)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na
She belongs to me
Kisses like cream, her walk is so mean
And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans
I don't exist if I don't have her
The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn
But I know, I know, I know for sure
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
She knows, she knows
That I never let her down before
Oh, she knows, she knows
That I'm never gonna let another take her love from me now

Everybody wanna take her heart away (Wants to take her love away)

===== One Direction - 18 =====
I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start, be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holdin' you, oh
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen
We took a chance, God knows we've tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink, oh, love
And let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything we can
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion
So kiss me where I lay down (Ooh-ooh)
My hands pressed to your cheeks (Ooh-ooh)
A long way from the playground (Ooh-ooh)
And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holdin' you, oh
And I wanna love like you made me feel
Oh, lord
Kiss me where I lay down
When we were eighteen (Eighteen)
When we were eighteen (Eighteen, yeah)

===== One Direction - You & I =====
I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
Did they ever fight like us?
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
But they never tried like us
'Cause you and I
Nothing can come between you and I (Nothing can come between, yeah)
No, nothing can come between you and I (You and I)
Oh, you and I (Oh)
We could make it if we try, you and I

===== One Direction - Best Song Ever =====
Maybe it's the way she walked (Ow!)
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards (Ow!)
Just like she already owned it
I said, "Can you give it back to me?"
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"
And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went, "Oh, oh, oh," I think it went, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
I think it goes (Woo!)
Said her name was Georgia Rose (Ow!)
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it
I said, "Can I take you home with me?"
We knew every line, now I can't remember (How it goes, but I know)
You know, I know, you know I'll remember you
And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me
And you know, I know, you know I'll remember you (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How we danced (Oh, oh, oh, one, two, one, two, three, ow!)
How we danced all night to the best song ever (How we danced)
We knew every line, now I can't remember (We knew every line)
'Cause we danced all night (We danced, we danced) to the best song ever (It goes something like this)
And we danced all night to the best song ever (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We knew every line, now I can't remember (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that I won't forget her)
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, best song ever)
Best song ever
It was the best song ever

===== One Direction - Little Things =====
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind, it was meant to be
And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you
And you'll never treat yourself right, darling, but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh, it's you, it's you, they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things
I'm in love with you and all your little things

===== One Direction - History =====
You gotta help me
I'm losing my mind
Keep getting the feelin'
You wanna leave this all behind
Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holdin' on
Aren't we?
No, they don't teach ya
This in school
Now my heart's breakin'
And I don't know what to do
You and me got a whole lot of history (Oh)
We could be the greatest team
That the world has ever seen
So don't let it go, we can make some more
We can live forever
All of the rumours
All of the fights
But we always find a way
To make it out alive
Thought we were holdin' on
Minibars, expensive cars
Hotel rooms and new tattoos
The good champagne and private planes
But they don't mean anything
'Cause the truth is out, I realise
That without you here, life is just a lie
This is not the end, this is not the end
We can make it, you know it, you know
So don't let me go, so don't let me go
Baby, don't you know? Baby, don't you know?

===== One Direction - They Don't Know About Us =====
People say we shouldn't be together
We're too young to know about forever
But I say, "They don't know
What they talk, talk, talkin' about" (Talk, talk, talkin' about)
'Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I don't wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl, oh
They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the I love you's
But I bet you, if they only knew (They don't know)
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right (They don't know)
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us
Just one touch and I was a believer
Every kiss, it gets a little sweeter
It's getting better
Keeps getting better all the time, girl
Just to find a love that feels this right
They don't know how special you are
They don't know what you've done to my heart
They can say anything they want
'Cause they don’t know us
They don't know what we do best
That's between me and you, our little secret
But I wanna tell 'em
I wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl
They don't know about the things we do (They don't know about the)
They don't know about the I love you's (I love you's)
But I bet you, if they only knew (If they only knew)
They would just be jealous of us (They would just be jealous of us)
They don't know I've waited all my life  (They don't know I've waited all my life)
Just to find a love that feels this right (It feels so right)
Baby, they don't know about (They don't know about us)
They don't know about the things we do (They don't know about us)
They don't know about the I love you's (They don't know about us)
But I bet you, if they only knew
They don't know about the up all nights (Up all nights)
They don't know I've waited all my life (All my life)
Just to find a love that feels this right (Right)
They don't know about us

===== One Direction - Right Now =====
Lights go down, and
The night is calling to me, yeah
I hear voices
Singing songs in the street, and I know
That we won't be going home
For so long, for so long, but I know
That I won't be on my own
Yeah, I love this feeling and
Right now I wish you were here with me (Ooh)
'Cause right now, everything is new to me (Ooh)
You know, I can't fight the feeling

===== One Direction - One Thing =====
I've tried playin' it cool
But when I'm lookin' at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep makin' me weak
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe
Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dyin' just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing
Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm goin' out of my mind
All day and all night
'Cause I'm dyin' just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
So get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life
(Woah, woah, woah)
You've got that one thing
Get out, get out, get out of my head
So get out, get out, get out of my head (Get out, get out, get out of my head, yeah)
And fall into my arms instead (Instead)
But I need that one thing (I need that one thing)
So get out, get out, get out of my mind (Out of my mind)

===== One Direction - Strong =====
My hands, your hands, tied up like two ships
Drifting, weightless, waves try to break it
I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to save it?
My heart, your heart, sit tight like bookends
Pages between us written with no end
So many words we're not saying
Don't wanna wait till it's gone
You make me strong
I'm sorry if I say I need you
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong
That you make me strong?
Think of how much love that's been wasted
People always trying to escape it
Move on to stop their heart breaking
But there's nothing I'm running from
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong?
So, baby, hold on to my heart, oh
Need you to keep me from fallin' apart
I'll always hold on 'cause you make me strong

===== One Direction - No Control =====
Oh
(Oh, oh)
Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Sweet (Oh), where you lay (Oh)
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case
Waking up beside you, I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control
(Oh)
Taste on my tongue
I don't want to wash away the night before
In the heat (Oh), where you lay (Oh)
I could stay right here and burn in it all day
Lost my senses, I'm defenseless
Her perfume's holding me ransom
Sweet and sour, heart devoured
Lying here, I count the hours
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun
No control

===== One Direction - If I Could Fly =====
If I could fly
I'd be coming right back home to you
I think I might
Give up everything, just ask me to
Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now, I'm completely defenceless
For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only
I've got scars
Even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard
But now you're here and I don't feel a thing
I can feel your heart inside of mine (I feel it, I feel it)
I've been going out of my mind (I feel it, I feel it)
Know that I'm just wasting time (And I)
Hope that you don't run from me
(Now you know me, for your eyes only)
For your eyes only, I show you my heart (Show you my heart)
For when you're lonely and forget who you are (Forget who you are)

===== One Direction - Olivia =====
Forty-three
And then?
And then you've gotta play the opposite part which means you, you rest for four bars
Right, so we stop there?
Right
Remember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving ya?
She's lyin' in bed with my t-shirt on
Just thinking how I went about it wrong
This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love
Please, believe me, don't you see the things you mean to me?
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love, I love, I love Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia (Ayy, ayy)
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go
Say what you're feelin' and say it now
'Cause I got the feelin' you're walkin' out
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya
The consequences of falling out
Are something I'm having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm cryin' out to be with ya
Don't let me go, (Don't) don't let me go (Go)
When you go and I'm alone
You live in my imagination
The summertime and butterflies
All belong to your creation
I love you, it's all I do, I love you
Don't let me go (Don't), don't let me go (Go)
Don't let me go, Olivia
No way
Thank you

===== George Michael - Careless Whisper =====
Oh, woah, woah, oh
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find
I should have known better than to cheat a friend (Shoulda known better, yeah)
Never without your love
Tonight, the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay
And I'm never gonna dance again
(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?

===== George Michael - Faith =====
Well, I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
I know not everybody has got a body like you
But I gotta think twice before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play because I played them too
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, when that love comes down without devotion
Well it takes a strong man, baby
But I'm showin' you the door
'Cause I gotta' have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith
I got to have faith, faith, faith
Baby, I know you're askin' me to stay
Say, "Please, please, please don't go away"
You say I'm givin' you the blues
Maybe (Huh) you mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
Before this river becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
Oh, baby, I reconsider my foolish notion
Well, I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for somethin' more
Yes I gotta have faith
Ooh, I gotta have faith
Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
I'll just have to wait
Because I've got to have faith
I've got to, got to, got to have faith
Oh, oh, baby, I reconsider my foolish notion

===== George Michael - Freedom! '90 =====
I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around
Oh yeah
Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV (rock and roll TV)
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Yeah, Yeah!)
Freedom!
I won't let you down (Freedom!)
I will not give you up (Freedom!)
(You got to give what you take)
It's the one good thing that I've got, (Freedom!)
So please don't give me up (Freedom!)
Cause I would really, really love to stick around (You got to give what you take)
Heaven knows we sure had some fun, boy
What a kick, just a buddy and me
(What a kick, just a buddy and me)
We had every big-shot goodtime band on the run, boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race, got out of the place
Went back home, got a brand new face for the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change oh yeah (Oh, yeah)
Now I'm gonna get myself happy
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's someone I forgot to be
Don’t think that I’ll be back again
Freedom
I will not give you up, (Freedom!)
It's the one good thing that I've got (Freedom!)
Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last
That's what you get, that's what you get, that's what you get
I say that's what you get
That's what you get for changing your mind
And after all this time
All we have to do now (Oh, yeah)
Freedom! (Oh!)
(My) Freedom!
You got to give what you take!
I'll hold on to my (Freedom!)
My (Freedom!)
You got to give what you take! (You got to give what, to give what, to give what you take!)
Yeah!
You got to give what, to give what, to give
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now
I've got to live

===== George Michael - Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me =====
I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life
It's much too late to save myself from fallin'
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light
Don't let the sun go down on me, yeah
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me (Baby, no)
Just because you think I mean you harm
(Just because you think I mean you harm, no)
But these cuts I have (Cuts I have)
They need love (They need love, they need love)
To help them heal, oh
Don't let the sun go down on me
'Cause losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else that I see, yeah
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, baby, oh
Mr. Elton John

===== George Michael - Father Figure =====
That's all I wanted, something special
Something sacred in your eyes
For just one moment to be bold and naked
At your side
Sometimes I think that you'll never
Understand me (Understand me)
Maybe this time is forever
Say it can be, woah-woah, oh
That's all you wanted, somethin' special
Someone sacred in your life
Just for one moment, to be warm and naked
At my side
But somethin' tells me together
We'd be happy, woah-woah, baby
I will be your father figure (Oh, baby)
Put your tiny hand in mine (I'd love to)
I will be your preacher, teacher (Be your daddy)
Anything you have in mind (It would make me)
I will be your father figure (Very happy)
I have had enough of crime (Please let me)
I will be the one who loves you
'Til the end of time (Of time)
That's all I wanted, but sometimes love can be mistaken
For a crime
That's all I wanted, just to see my baby's
Blue eyes shine
This time I think that my lover
Understands me (Understands me), hee
If we have faith in each other
Then we can be strong, baby
I will be your father figure
Put your tiny hand in mine (My baby)
I will be your preacher, teacher
Anything you have in mind (Hee)
I have had enough of crime
'Til the end of time
If you are the desert, I'll be the sea
If you ever hunger, hunger for me
Whatever you ask for, that's what I'll be
So when you remember the ones who have lied
Who said that they cared, but then laughed as you cried
Beautiful darling, don't think of me, because all I ever wanted
It's in your eyes
Baby (Baby, baby)
And love can't lie, no
Greet me with the eyes of a child
My love is always tellin' me so
Heaven is a kiss and a smile
Just hold on, hold on, and I won't let you go, my baby
Put your tiny hand in mine
I'm everything you have in mind, baby
And I have had enough of crime
So I am gonna love you
I will be your father (I will be your)
I will be your preacher (Father)
I will be your father (I'll be your daddy, oh)

===== George Michael - I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me) =====
Like a warrior that fights and wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally
Somehow I made it through the heartache, yes, I did
Oh, I escaped Aha ha
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith
When the river was deep, I didn't falter
When the mountain was high, I still believed
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting, I knew you were waiting for me
Uh huh
With an endless desire, I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like a bridge that's on fire, the hurt is over
One touch and you set me free
No, I don't regret a single moment, no I don't
(I know you don't) Looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me, oh
I knew you were waiting, hey, I knew you were waiting for me
So we were drawn together through destiny, ooh boy, ooh!
I know this love we share was meant to be, oh
(Knew you were waiting) Ooh, yeah
(Knew you were waiting) I knew you were waiting
(Knew you were waiting for me)
(I didn't falter) I didn't falter, no
(I still believed) When the valley was low
(It didn't stop me) Nothing can stop me, no
(I knew you were waiting) No, I
(I knew you were waiting for me)
(I didn't falter) When the mountain was high
(I still believed) Oh, when the valley was low
(It didn't stop me) No, it didn't stop me, no
(I knew you were waiting)
(I didn't falter) Oh, oh yeah
(I still believed) Oh, I still believed
(It didn't stop me) Do you know it couldn't stop me now? No
(Knew you were waiting)
Someday (someday), somehow (somehow)
For me
(I didn't falter) When the valley was low
(I still believed) I still believe (I believed, I believed)
(It didn't stop me) Yeah, it couldn't stop me

===== George Michael - Fastlove, Pt. 1 =====
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
Gotta get up to get down
Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby can't you read the signs?
I won’t bore you with the details, baby
I don't even want to waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind
Baby, I ain’t Mr. Right
But if you're looking for fastlove
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind
Ooh baby
What's there to think about, baby?
Hey baby, oh yeah
Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
They're all having babies
But I just want to have some fun
I won't bore you with the details, baby
Gonna get there in your own sweet time
Let’s just say that maybe
If that’s love in your eyes
Some fastlove is all that I've got on my mind
Get yourself some lessons in love
So close
I can taste it now, baby
In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
But I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby (Oh, yeah)
I miss my baby (tonight)
So why don't we make a little room in my BMW, babe?
Searching for some peace of mind
Hey, I’ll help you find it
I do believe that we are practicing the same religion
Oh, you really ought to get up now
That's right
Oh you really oughta get up
(Ooh ooh, baby baby)
Oh yeah

===== George Michael - One More Try =====
I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm lookin' out for angels
Just tryin' to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't, just let me go
'Cause teacher, there are things
That I don't wanna learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Tellin' me no!
So you think that you love me
And know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go
And teacher, there are things
Oh, the last one I had
So I don't want to learn to hold you, touch you
So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go!
That I still have to learn
But the one thing I have
Is my pride
Oh, so I don't wanna learn to hold you, touch you
Because there ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Who just is unwillin' to try
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more try

===== George Michael - Jesus to a Child =====
Kindness in your eyes
I guess you heard me cry
You smiled at me like Jesus to a child
I'm blessed
I know Heaven sent and Heaven stole
And what have I learned from all this pain
I thought I never feel the same about anyone
Or anything again
But now I know
When you find a love
When you know that it exists
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you on those cold, cold nights
When you've been loved
When you know it holds such bliss
Then the lover that you kissed
Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight
Sadness in my eyes
No one guessed and no one tried
Loveless and cold
With your last breath, you saved my soul
And what have I learned from all these tears?
I've waited for you all those years
Then just when it began
He took your love away
But I still say
So the words you could not say
I'll sing them for you
And the love we would have made
I'll make it for two
For every single memory
Has become a part of me
You will always be
My love
Well, I've been loved so I know just what love is
And the lover that I kissed
Is always by my side
Oh, the lover I still miss
Was Jesus to a child

===== George Michael - As =====
Do do do do, whoa whoa whoa
Do do do do
As around the Sun the Earth knows
She's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's a cure
You can rest your mind assured
That I'll be lovin' you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Always)
Until the day that is the day that I'm no more
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
That last through forever
Another day
As today I know I'm living for tomorrow
Couldn't make me be the past
But that I mustn't fear
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I left behind
And I'll be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
(Now ain't that lovin' you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
(I'll be lovin' you forever)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
(True love don't want a thing)
To last through forever
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
The love of me I've left behind
Lovin' you until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Lovin' you until the ocean covers every mountain high
Lovin' you until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Lovin' you until the dream of life and life becomes a dream
(Now ain't that lovin' you, yeah yeah)
(Now ain't that lovin' you, yeah)
(I'll be loving you forever)
(I'll be loving, loving, check this out)
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more
Always
Until the dream of life and life becomes a dream
Check this out
I'll be love, love, yeah
Parrots live at sea

===== George Michael - Kissing a Fool =====
You are far
When I could have been your star
You listened to people who scared you to death and from my heart
Strange that you were strong enough to even make a start
But you'll never find peace of mind 'til you listen to your heart
People
You can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will
For they will
If you let them steal your heart from you
Will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen love through
Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So goodbye
But please don't take my heart
I'm never gonna be your star
I'll pick up the pieces and mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough
I don't know where to start
But I'll never find peace of mind, while I listen to my heart
If you let them steal your heart
And people
Ba-da-da-ah-ah-ah
But remember this, every other kiss
That you ever give long as we both live
When you need the hand of another man
One you really can surrender with
I will wait for you like I always do
There's somethin' there that can't compare with any other
Strange that I was wrong enough to think you'd love me too
Guess you were kissing a fool
You must have been kissing a fool

===== George Michael - Amazing =====
I was mixed up when you came to me
Too broke to fix
Said, "Daddy get you gone, I'm missin' my baby"
Still missin' my baby
I was stitched up by the hands of fate
Said, "How you gonna make it on your own
If luck is a lady?"
Maybe luck is a lady
I was goin' down for the third time
My heart was broken, I was not open to your suggestions
I had so many questions
That you just kissed away
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
The day you walked in and changed my life
I think it's amazing
The way that love can set you free
So now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought that my saviour would come
I think you're amazing
You tried to save me from myself
Said, "Darlin', kiss as many as you want
My love's still available
And I know you're insatiable"
We're like victims of the same disease
Look at your big bad daddy and your mom
And your mom was always acting crazy
My heart was broken, I thought that lovin' you was out of the question
(Loving you was out of the question)
Then I saw my reflection (Reflection)
Sayin', "Please, don't let this go"
(Celebrate the love of the one you're with)
Celebrate this life with you baby
I think you should celebrate, yeah
Don't put your love in chains, baby
Now I walk in the midday sun
I never thought I would see love
I said celebrate the love of the one you're with
Celebrate!
As this life gets colder
And the devil inside
Tells you to give up, baby

===== George Michael - Somebody to Love =====
This song is one of my favorites
It's called "Somebody to Love"
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and I cry
Lord, what you're doing to me?
I spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord
Somebody, ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
I work hard every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
I go down on my knees and I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes
Lord somebody, ooh somebody
Everyday I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Aw, they ain't got no common sense
He's got nobody left to believe in
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, somebody, ooh
I got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm alright, I'm alright
I ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord
I wanna hear every single person
See every single pair of hands
Three, four
Find me somebody to love
Somebody, somebody
Somebody find me
Somebody find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me
Somebody to (C'mon) love?
Yeah
Find me somebody, somebody, somebody to love
Find me, find me, find me, find me, find me
Ooh, somebody to love
Anybody, anyway
Anybody find me somebody to love?
Yeah, yeah
Love
Thank you very much, everyone
Take care

===== George Michael - Praying for Time =====
These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand
With ignorance and legitimate excuses
The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much, but we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back, and all God's children
Crept out the back door
And it's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above
Say it's much, much too late
Well, maybe we should all be praying for time
These are the days of the empty hand
Oh, you hold on to what you can
And charity
Is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find
That what was over there is over here
So you scream from behind your door
Say, "What's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much, but I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score"
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That He can't come back
'Cause He has no children to come back for?
It's hard to love
Say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time

===== George Michael - Too Funky =====
I am not trying to seduce you
Would you like me to seduce you?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Y'all ready?
Hey, you're just too funky for me
I gotta get inside of you
And I'll show you heaven
If you let me
I gotta get inside (I gotta get inside)
So when will that be?
I watch your fingers working overtime (overtime)
I've got to thinking that they should be mine (oh)
I'd love to see you naked baby
I'd like to think that sometime maybe tonight
If that's alright, yeah
Won't let you go, I won't let you no no
I'll make you love me
I watch you drinking and I take my time (take my time)
I watch you sinking all of that cheap red wine (oh)
I've got to see you naked baby
My goal's in sight, yeah
Baby, baby, baby why do you do this to me?
Won't let you go (won't let you go)
You're such a... you're such a...
Baby, baby, baby, why do you do this to me?
I got to know (I got to know)
(I'm gonna be the kind of lover that you never had)
Hey, you're just too funky
(You're never gonna have another lover in your bed)
You're just too funky for me
(Would you like me to seduce you?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?)
Everybody wants a lover like that, baby
Everybody wants a lover like that
Yeah, yeah
Everybody, everybody
(Is that what you're trying to tell me?)
Everybody wants a lover
(Would you like me to seduce you?)
Would you stop playing with that radio of yours?
I'm trying to get to sleep

===== George Michael - A Different Corner =====
I'd say love was a magical thing
I'd say love would keep us from pain
Had I been there, had I been there
I would promise you all of my life
But to lose you would cut like a knife
So I don't dare, no I don't dare
Cause I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared, I'm so scared
Take me back in time maybe I can forget
Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Would you care
I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze
Little by little you've brought me to my knees
Don't you care
No I've never come close in all of these years
I'm so scared of this love
And if all that there is, is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If I could, I would, I swear

===== George Michael - Outside =====
Let's go outside
Back to nature
Outside
Human nature
Back to--
I think I'm done with the sofa
I think I'm done with the hall
I think I'm done with the kitchen table, baby
Let's go outside, in the sunshine
I know you want to, but you can't say yes
Let's go outside, in the moonshine
Take me to the places that I love best
So my angel she says "don't you worry
'Bout the things they're saying, yeah
Got no friends in high places
And the game that you gave away wasn't worth playing"
Let's go outside (Let's go outside), in the sunshine
Let's go outside (Let's go outside), in the meantime
And yes, I've been bad
Doctor won't you do with me what you can
You see I think about it all the time
24/7
You say you want it, you got it
I never really said it before
There's nothing here but flesh and bone
There's nothing more, nothing more, there's nothing more
Back to nature, just human nature
Getting on back to -
Let's go outside (Let's go outside), in the moonshine
I'd service the community, but I already have you see
Dancing on the D-train baby
When the moon is high
And the grass is jumpin'
Come on, just keep on funkin'
Keep on funkin', just keep on funkin'

===== George Michael - Heal the Pain =====
Put it in your heart and then keep it
Something that I want you to know
Do something for me
Listen to my simple story
And maybe we'll have something to show
You tell me you're cold on the inside
How can the outside world
Be a place that your heart can embrace
Be good to yourself
'Cause nobody else
Has the power to make you happy
How can I help you
Please let me try to
I can heal the pain
That you're feeling inside
Whenever you want me
You know that I will be
Waiting for the day
That you say you'll be mine
He must have really hurt you
To make you say the things that you do
To make those pretty eyes look so blue
He must have known
That he could
That you'd never leave him
Now you can't see my love is good
And that I'm not him
Won't you let me inside
Won't you let me in
Let this love begin
Won't you show me your heart now
I'll be good to you
I can make this thing true
Show me that heart right now
Who needs a lover
That can't be a friend
Something tells me I'm the one you've been looking for, oh
If you ever should see him again
Won't you tell him you've found someone who gives you more
Someone who will protect you
Love and respect you
All those things
That he never could bring to you
Like I do or rather I would
Won't you show me your heart
Like you should
And get to your heart somehow

===== George Michael - I Want Your Sex, Pts. 1 & 2 =====
There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys you can trust
And girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes
I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies (Yeah)
Don't need no Bible
Just look in my eyes
I've waited so long, baby
Now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where mine ends
I want your sex
I want your love
It's playin' on my mind
It's dancin' on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go?
I'd really like to try
Oh, I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you, but you still say no
Don't need no bible
Just look in my eyes (Ooh)
Out in the cold
I can't take much more, girl
I'm losing control
I want your sex (Sex! Ow!)
It's natural, it's chemical (Let's do it)
It's logical habitual (Can we do it?)
It's sensual
But most of all
Sex is something that we should do
Sex is something for me and you
Sex is natural, sex is good
Not everybody does it, but everybody should
Sex is natural, sex is fun
Sex is best when it's one on one
One on one
Hoo-ah (Sex) I'm not your father
Hoo-ah (Sex) I'm not your brother
(Sex) talk to your sister
Hoo-ah (Sex) I am a lover
Hoo-ah (Sex) Woo-ooh!
Hoo-ah (Sex)
Hoo-ah (Sex) Ow!
C-c-c-c-c-c-come on (Hoo-ah)
What's your definition of dirty, baby?
What do you consider pornography?
Don't you know I love it 'til it hurts me, baby?
Don't you think it's time you had sex with me?
What do you call pornography?
Don't you know I love it 'til it hurts me baby?
Ow! Sex with me
Mmm, have sex with me (Hoo-ah)
C-c-c-c-c-c-come on
Oh, yeah
I, I, I want you, baby
Oh, so much love that you've never seen
Let's make love, put your trust in me (Hmm)
Don't you listen to what they told you
'Cause I love you, let me hold you, oh
Oh, I'm not your brother
I'm not your father
Oh, will you ever change your mind?
Ow! I'm a gentle lover with a heart of gold
Baby, you've been so unkind, oh
Come on, I want your sex
That's right, all night
Oh, I want your sex
Sexy baby, sexy body
Keep me guessing
With a promise
I know we can come together
But the question is, will we ever, ever?
Sexy baby, (Sexy baby), sexy body (Sexy body)
Keeps me guessing (Keeps me guessing)
With a promise (Oh)
Ohh, together
You and me

===== George Michael - Cowboys and Angels =====
When your heart's in someone else's hands
Monkey see and monkey do, their wish is your command
You're not to blame, everyone's the same
All you do is love and love is all you do
I should know by now the way I fought for you
I know you think that you're safe, mister
Harmless deception that keeps love at bay
It's the ones who resist that we most want to kiss
Wouldn't you say?
Cowboys and angels, they all have the time for you
Why should I imagine that I'd be a find for you?
Why should I imagine that I'd have something to say?
But that scar on your face, that beautiful face of yours
In your heart, there's a trace of someone before
When your heart's in someone else's plans
Things you say and things you do, that they don't understand
It's such a shame, always ends the same
You can call it love but I don't think it's true
You should know by now, I'm not the boy for you
You're not to blame, always ends the same
I know you think that you're safe, sister
Harmless affection that keeps things this way
It's the ones who persist for the sake of a kiss
Who will pay
Cowboys and angels, they all take a shine to you
Why should I imagine that I was designed for you?
Why should I believe that you would stay?
That scar on your face, that beautiful face of yours
Don't you think that I'd know they've hurt you, before?
Take this man to your bed
Maybe his hands will help you forget
Please be stronger than your past
The future may still give you a chance

===== Lana Del Rey - Young And Beautiful =====
I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul
Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds
And will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothin' but my aching soul?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?

===== Lana Del Rey - Video Games =====
Swingin' in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
Whistlin' my name
Open up a beer and you say, "Get over here
And play a video game"
I'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say, "You the bestest," lean in for a big kiss, put his favorite perfume on
"Go play your video game"
It's you, it's you, it's all for you, everything I do
I tell you all the time, Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls, honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And, baby, now you do
Mmm
Singin' in the old bars, swinging with the old stars
Livin' for the fame
Kissin' in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms, drunk, and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watchin' all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's, this is my idea of fun
Playin' video games
(N-now you do, now you do, now you do)
Mmm, now you do

===== Lana Del Rey - West Coast =====
Down on the West coast, they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy Blue, yeah, you
You're falling hard, I push away, I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say, "I miss you so much"
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, my love
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move, baby, move, baby, I'm in love
I'm in love (I'm in love)
(Mic-check)
(One, two)
(Two, two)
(Get it, girl)
Down on the West coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
Down on the West coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and rock 'n' roll groupies
You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy, it's you I desire
I'm in love

===== Lana Del Rey - Brooklyn Baby =====
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice, I freeze
I'm churning out novels like
Beat poetry on amphetamines
I say
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-ya-da
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da
They say I'm too dumb to see
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burning up, I'm cooling down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see
But I'm free, ooh
I'm free
I'm talking 'bout my generation
I'm talking 'bout my newer nation
And if you don't like it, you can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget
'Cause I don't have to fucking explain it
And my boyfriend's in a band
I get high on hydroponic weed
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-de-da
Te-de-de, da-da-ah
Ooh, oh, woah-ah
Yeah, my boyfriend's pretty cool
But he's not as cool as me
'Cause I'm a Brooklyn baby
Da-da-da-da-da, baby
Ah-ta-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, baby
Pa-da-da-da-da-da
Pa-pa-da-pa-da, yeah
Yeah, yeah

===== Lana Del Rey - Born To Die =====
Why? (Got that?)
Who? Me? (Louder)
Feet don't fail me now, take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (Louder)
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane (Louder, alright)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
Lost, but now I am found
I can see that, once, I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey (Louder)
(We were born to die, we were born to die)
We were born to die
(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)
You like your girls insane
So don't make me sad, don't make me cry
(Louder)
(Got that?)

===== Lana Del Rey - Doin' Time =====
Summertime and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home, there's none left for me
(Harder, yeah, harder, yeah)
Oh, take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will, some day, rise
So what am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said I'm gonna play with myself
Show them how we come off the shelf
Evil, we've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
The tension, it's getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater
(Summertime)
(Ah, ah, ah)

===== Lana Del Rey - Cinnamon Girl =====
Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win
There's things I wanna say to you
But I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about
But better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, on fire again

===== Lana Del Rey - Diet Mountain Dew =====
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Baby, put on heart-shaped sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I been waitin' up all night
Take another drag, turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it's gonna be alright
Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed, it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye
But, baby, I want you, I want you
But, baby, I want you, I want you, I want you
Baby stoppin' at 7-Eleven
There in his white Pontiac Heaven
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City (You're no good for me)
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty? (Baby, you're no good for me)
Do you think we'll be in love forever? (You're no good for me)
Do you think we'll be in love? (But, baby, I want you, I want)

===== Lana Del Rey - Radio =====
Not even they can stop me now
Boy, I be flyin' overhead
Their heavy words can't bring me down
Boy, I've been raised from the dead
No one even knows how hard life was
I don't even think about it now because
I finally found you
Oh, sing it to me
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm livin' in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playin' on the radio
How do you like me now?
Pick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh, yeah
American dreams came true somehow
I swore I'd chase 'em 'til I was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's what my father said
No one even knows what life was like
Now I'm in L.A. and it's paradise
Sweet like cinnamon
I finally found you (Radio, radio, radio)
How do you like me now? (Oh, sing it to me)

===== Lana Del Rey - Blue Jeans =====
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip-hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, "No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work"
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipatin' and pacing
But he was chasin' (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh)
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard
You went out every night and, baby, that's alright
I told you that, no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'm a ride or die whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more, that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancin' all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

===== Lana Del Rey - Dark Paradise =====
All my friends tell me  I should move on
I'm lyin' in the ocean, singin' your song
"Ah," That's how you sang it
Lovin' you forever can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
"Ah," That's how we played it
And there's no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is hauntin' me
And tellin' me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead (Dead like you)
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em, "When you find true love, it lives on"
Ah, that's why I stay here
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushin' me
But I can feel you touchin' me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Tellin' me I'm fine
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side (So tell me)

===== Lana Del Rey - Chemtrails Over The Country Club =====
I'm on the run with you, my sweet love
There's nothing wrong contemplating God
Under the chemtrails over the country club
Wearin' our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playin' it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club
Take out your turquoise and all of your jewels
Go to the market, the kids' swimming pools
Baby, what's your sign?
My moon's in Leo, my Cancer is sun
You won't play, you're no fun
Well, I don't care what they think
Drag racing my little red sports car
I'm not unhinged or unhappy, I'm just wild
Under the chemtrails over the country club
Wearin' our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playin' it cool
Meet you for coffee at the elementary schools
We laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool
It's beautiful how this deep normality settles down over me
I'm not bored or unhappy, I'm still so strange and wild
You're in the wind, I'm in the water
Nobody's son, nobody's daughter
Watching the chemtrails over the country club
Suburbia, The Brentwood Market
What to do next? Maybe we'll love it
White picket chemtrails over the country club
My love, my love
Washing my hair, doing the laundry
Late night TV, I want you on me
Like when we were kids under chemtrails and country clubs
It's never too late, baby, so don't give up
Under the chemtrails over the country club, yeah (You're born in December and I'm born in June)
Under the chemtrails, over the country club, yeah (You're born in December and I'm born in June)
My Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon

===== Lana Del Rey - Ride =====
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I been out on that open road
But you can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been gettin' old
But you can be my full-time baby, hot or cold
Don't break me down (Don't break me down)
I been traveling too long (I been traveling too long)
I been tryin' too hard (I been tryin' too hard)
With one pretty song (With one pretty song)
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride
Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life and art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark
Don't leave me now (Don't leave me now)
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Don't turn around (Don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)
I just ride, just ride
I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

===== Lana Del Rey - Art Deco =====
Club queen on the downtown scene
Prowling around at night
You're not mean, you're just born to be seen
Born to be wild
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in but you just can't win
So you hang in the lights
You're so Art Deco out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them
'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more
Young thing on the downtown scene
Rolling around at night
Got things that have yet to be seen
Like your rapper's delight
You want in, but you just can't win
So you stay in the lights
A little party never hurt no one
So you stay out late
That's what your friends say
You put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time
Put your life out on the line
Not you and me
We were born to be free

===== Lana Del Rey - Lust For Life =====
Oh
Climb up the H of the Hollywood sign (Yeah)
In these stolen moments, the world is mine
There's nobody here, just us together
Keepin' me hot like July forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come late
'Cause, boy, we're gold, boy, we're gold
And I was like
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight, yeah
And a lust for life (And a lust for life)
Keeps us alive (Keeps us alive)
(Then)
We dance on the H of the Hollywood sign (Yeah)
'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die
My boyfriend's back (Oh-oh) and he's cooler than ever (Woah)
There's no more night, blue skies forever
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control
'Cause we're havin' too much fun
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
I told you twice in our love letter
There's no stopping now, green lights forever

===== Lana Del Rey - Ultraviolence =====
He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that, he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence
He used to call me poison
Like I was poison ivy
I could have died right there
'Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that, loving him was never enough
We could go back to New York
Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on Earth
I would do anything for you, baby
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold like lemonade
I love you the first time, I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa, comprende mis white lines
'Cause I'm your jazz singer and you're my cult leader
I love you forever, I love you forever
With his ultraviolence (Lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (In my linen and curls)
Ultraviolence (Lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (Riviera Girls)

===== Lana Del Rey - Happiness is a butterfly =====
Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 AM, it feels like summer
Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it, like, every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone, like, every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
With you
Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner, ah
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Espresso =====
Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
I can't relate to desperation
My give-a-fucks are on vacation
And I got this one boy and he won't stop calling
When they act this way, I know I got 'em
(Mm) Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
(Mm) Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
(Mm) Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
(Yes) I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
(Yes) That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
(Yes) One touch and I brand-newed it for ya (Ooh)
And now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Holy shit
Is it that sweet? I guess so (Mm)
I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer
Oh, he looks so cute wrapped 'round my finger
My twisted humor make him laugh so often
My honeybee, come and get this pollen
(Mm) Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya (Ayy, ayy, oh)
(Yes) One touch and I brand-newed it for ya (Stupid)
That's that me espresso (Yes)
Thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh

Move it up, down, left, right, oh (Move it up, down, left, right, oh)
Switch it up like Nintendo (Yes)
Mm, that's that me espresso

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Please Please Please =====
I know I have good judgment, I know I have good taste
It's funny and it's ironic that only I feel that way
I promise 'em that you're different and everyone makes mistakes
But just don't
I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy
Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight
I tell them it's just your culture and everyone rolls their eyes
Yeah, I know
All I'm asking, baby
Please, please, please
Don't prove I'm right
And please, pleasе, please
Don't bring me to tеars when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (Ah)
Well, I have a fun idea, babe (Uh-huh), maybe just stay inside
I know you're cravin' some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice (It's so nice, right?)
And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding, but really (Kinda), really, really
Please, please, please (Please don't prove I'm right)
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing (Heartbreak is one thing), my ego's another (Ego's another)
If you wanna go and be stupid
Don't do it in front of me
If you don't wanna cry to my music
Don't make me hate you prolifically
Please, please, please (Please)
Please (Please), please (Please), please
(Ah)

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Nonsense =====
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh, la-la)
Da-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah
Think I only want one number in my phone
I might change your contact to "Don't Leave Me Alone"
You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh
But I can't help myself when you get close to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-blee"
I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me (Me)
I'll be honest
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
And when you got your arms around me
Oh, it feels so good
I had to jump the octave
I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'm talkin' all around the clock
I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks
I'm talkin' opposite of soft
I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts
You gotta keep up with me
I got some young energy
I caught the L-O-V-E
How do you do this to me?
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-bleh-blee"
And I don't want no one else (No, no), baby, I'm in too deep (Too deep)
Here's a lil' song I wrote (A song I wrote), it's about you and me
I'll be honest (Honest)
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense (Nonsense)
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in (When you walk in)
When you got your arms around me
I had to hit the octave
I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense (Oh-oh)
I'm talkin', I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Na-na-na), I'm talkin'
(Blah-blah, blah-blah)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah (Ah-ah)
I don't even know anymore
(Oh)
This song catchier than chickenpox is
I bet your house is where my other sock is
Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a pop hit, ha-ha
How quickly can you take your clothes off? Pop quiz
That one's not gonna make it
Most of these aren't gonna make—

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Taste =====
Oh, I leave quite an impression
Five feet to be exact
You're wonderin' why half his clothes went missin'
My body's where they're at
Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation
I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do
Just know you'll taste me too
Uh-huh
He pins you down on the carpet
Makes paintings with his tongue (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Hе's funny now, all his jokes hit different
Guеss who he learned that from?
Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
If you want forever, and I bet you do (I bet you do)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Every time you close your eyes
And feel his lips, you're feelin' mine
And every time you breathe his air
Just know I was already there
You can have him if you like
I've been there, done that once or twice
And singin' 'bout it don't mean I care
Yeah, I know I've been known to share
Well, I heard you're back together and if that's true
Taste me too, ow (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
You, no, yeah, ah-ah (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Feather =====
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
Oh, not another take
Oh, it's like that, I'm your dream come true
When it's on a platter for you
Then you pull back when I try to make plans
More than two hours in advance, mm
I slam the door, I hit ignore
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked, after this, an afterthought
I finally cut you off
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind (Ah)
Floatin' through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time (Ah)
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch
You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic"
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you out my life
With you out my life
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah
It feels so good
Not carin' where you are tonight
And it feels so good
Not pretendin' to like the wine you like
I slam the door (Slam the door), I hit ignore (Hit ignore)
I got you blocked, excited to never talk, I
I'm so sorry for your loss
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch (A bitch)
Ah, mm
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather
You want me? I'm done
You miss me? No duh
Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at
You want me? I'm done (I'm done)
You miss me? No duh (No duh)
Where I'm at, I'm up (I'm up) where I'm at
(I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind)
(Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather)
(Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah)

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Bed Chem =====
I was in a sheer dress the day that we met
We were both in a rush, we talked for a sec
Your friend hit me up so we could connect
And what are the odds? You send me a text
And now the next thing I know, I'm like
Manifest that you're oversized
I digress, got me scrollin' like
Out of breath, got me goin' like
Ooh (Ah)
Who's the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent? Like
Maybe it's all in my head
But I bеt we'd have really good bеd chem
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round
Oh, it just makes sense
How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things
That's bed (Bed) chem (Chem)
How you're lookin' at me, yeah, I know what that means
And I'm obsessed
Are you free next week?
I bet we'd have really good
Come right on me, I mean camaraderie
Said you're not in my time zone, but you wanna be
Where art thou? Why not uponeth me?
See it in my mind, let's fulfill the prophecy
Who's the cute guy with the wide blue eyes and the big bad mm? Like
I know I sound a bit redundant
But I bet we'd have really good bed chem
Oh, it just makes sense (Oh, it just makes sense)
How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things (Bad)
That's bed chem (Oh, that's bed chem)
And I'm obsessed (So obsessed)
I bet we'd have really good (Bed chem)
And I bet we'd both arrive at the same time (Bed chem)
And I bet the thermostat's set at six-nine (Bed-bed ch-chem)
And I bet it's even better than in my head (My)
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round (Ooh)
Are you free next week? (Are you free next week?)
Ha (Make me go), ha
No-no-no
No-no-no, no, oh no, oh
Ha (Make me go), ha (Yeah, yeah)
No-no-no, oh
Ooh, oh, baby
(A little fade-out?)

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Looking at Me =====
Oh
Oh, yeah
Did I catch your attention?
You look like you lost your breath, huh
When I circle the room, you an owl, you gon' twist your head
Don't you come at me green with an attitude
When my lips and my soles are red
If I leave you behind, you can look for the broken necks
No, no
'Cause I've been here once or twice
Never worry 'bout the eyes (Come on)
Don't just stand there staring, honey
Try to move your feet
If you think they looking at you
They looking at me
I could make it nice and easy
I'ma take the lead
They ain't even looking at you, baby
Yeah, yeah, they looking at me
Yes, I'm young for a teacher, I'll teach you what you don't know
(I can teach you the things that you wanna know)
But I can't give it up all at once, you would overdose
Don't you bring any bull in the room tonight
It's a whole new rodeo
It could be you and me, but you know that I'll steal the show
Oh (Yeah)
(I've been here once or twice, babe)
Never worry 'bout the eyes
I'ma take the lead (I'ma takin' the lead)

Yeah, yeah, they looking at me (They're looking at me)
But they looking at me, babe (They're looking at me)
'Cause they looking at me, baby
They're looking at me
They're looking at me (Hey)

Don't just stand there staring, honey (Stand there staring, honey)
Try to move your feet (Try to move your feet now)
(They just looking at me, they just looking at me)
(Yeah, they're looking at me, my baby, baby, baby)
(They're looking at me)
Don't you know that they looking at me?

===== Sabrina Carpenter - because i liked a boy =====
I said I wanted Thin Mints and you said you knew a guy
You showed up with a boombox and stars in your eyes
Who knew cuddling on trampolines could be so reckless?
We bonded over Black Eyed Peas and complicated exes
Fell so deeply into it
It was all so innocent
Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
I got death threats fillin' up semitrucks
Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
All because I liked
I'm the hot topic on your tongue
I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young
All because I liked a boy
Ah, mmm
I'm not catastrophizing, everything's derailing
Was only tryna hold you close while your heart was failing
It's not internet illusion, just two kids going through it
You said I'm too late to be your first love, but I'll always be your favorite
Ah
Dating boys with exes
No, I wouldn't recommend it
I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut
And all of this for what?
When everything went down, we'd already broken up
Please tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice
Ah (A boy)

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Juno =====
(Ooh, ah-ah, ooh)
Don't have to tell your hot ass a thing
Oh yeah, you just get it
Whole package, babe, I like the way you fit
God bless your dad's genetics, mm, uh
You make me wanna make you fall in love
Oh, late at night, I'm thinking 'bout you, ah-ah
Wanna try out my fuzzy pink handcuffs?
Oh, I hear you knockin', baby, come on up
I know you want my touch for life
If you love me right, then who knows?
I might let you make me Juno
You know I just might
Let you lock me down tonight
One of me is cute, but two though?
Give it to me, baby
You make me wanna make you fall in love (Oh)
I showed my friends, then we high-fived (Ah-ah)
Sorry if you feel objеctified (Ah-ah)
Can't help myself, hormonеs are high
Give me more than just some butterflies
Wanna try out some freaky positions?
Have you ever tried this one?
Adore me
Hold me and explore me
Mark your territory (Ah-ah)
Tell me I'm the only, only, only, only one (Ah-ah)
Hold me and explore me (Ah-ah)
I'm so fuckin' horny
Tell me I'm the only, only, only, only one
Ah
Ooh-ooh
(Oh, I) I know you want my touch for life
You know I just might (Might)

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Thumbs =====
Somewhere in the world, there is a father and a mother
And the father is a son who has a mother
The mother has a daughter who gets married to the brother of a mother
And they all just tryna multiply with one another
'Cause that's just the way of the world
It never ends 'til the end, then you start again
That's just the way of the world
Somewhere in the world, they think they're working for themselves
They get up every day to go to work for someone else
And somebody works for them, and so they think they got it made
But they're all just working to get paid the very same
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Dum, dum, dum, dum)

Skiddly-dee-dat-dum (Skiddly-dee-dat-dum)
Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum (Dum, dum, dum)
Somewhere in the world, you got a robber and a bank
And the bank robbed the people, so the people rob the bank
And the police came to get him, but they let him get away
'Cause they're all just working to get paid the very same
It never ends 'til the end, then you start again (And then you start again)
Don't believe everything that you hear
Let it go through your left and right ear
Don't just march to the beat of that drum
Don't be one of them people just twiddlin' them thumbs
'Cause that's just the way of the world (Way of the world)
It never ends 'til the end, and then you start again (Start again)
And so they keep on twiddlin' them thumbs (Keep on)

Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum (Woo, woo)
(Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum)

Skiddly-dee-dat-dum-dum ('Cause that's just the way of the world)

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Good Graces =====
(I won't give a fuck about you)
Oh, mm
Mm
When I love you, I'm sweet like an angel
Drawin' hearts 'round our names
And dreamin' of writing vows, rockin' cradles
Don't mistake my nice for naive
I don't waste a second, I know lots of guys
You do somethin' suspect, this cute ass bye-bye
Like, ooh
Baby, you say you really like it being mine?
So let me give you some advice
Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces
Or I'll switch it up like that so fast
'Cause no one's more amazin'
At turnin' lovin' into hatred
Or I'll switch it up like that (Like that) so fast (So fast)
I won't give a fuck about you
That was cool
I won't give a fuck about you (Oh)
Yeah
I'll tell the world you finish your chores prematurely
Break my heart and I swear I'm movin' on
With your favorite athlete
Shoot his shot every night
Want you every second, don't need other guys
You do somethin' sus, kiss my cute ass bye
You should stay in my good graces (Ah)
'Cause no one's more amazin' (Amazin')
Boy, it's not that complicated (No)
Oh, no
Oh
No, I won't
I won't give a fuck about you, no, I won't
(I won't, I won't, I won't)

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Sue Me =====
Remember when you said it, there's no second chance?
Oh, baby, I heard you been hoping you could change the past
You miss the long goodnights, you miss the long goodbyes
You miss the long goodnights (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
Well, did you ever think that it was hard for me
To walk it off like nothing happened, nonchalantly?
I got you feeling like, I got you feeling right
I got you feeling like (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
That's my shape, I made the shadow
That's my name, don't wear it out though
Feelin' myself can't be illegal, illegal
So sue me for looking too pretty tonight
Wearing your favorite color under the lights
For moving on, doing everything right
So sue me for being good friends with your friends
And running into you the place that we met
For being something you can't forget
So sue me
(Go)
It's hard to see me on when you been off as hell
But I'm not gonna dull myself because you dull yourself
I know it's hard to see what you don't want to see
I know it's hard to see (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)
I, I, I
I guess I'm hard to ignore
Pick up that jaw off the floor
(Everything right, no, no, everything right, no, no, oh)
(With your friends, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(The place that we met)
(You can't forget, no)
Sue me, baby
No, no

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Skin =====
Maybe we could've been friends
If I met you in another life
Maybe then we could pretend
There's no gravity in the words we write
Maybe you didn't mean it
Maybe "blonde" was the only rhyme
The only rhyme
Want my heart to be breakin', breakin', no
I'm happy and you hate it, hate it, oh
And I'm not asking you to let it go
But you been tellin' your side
So I'll be tellin' mine, oh
You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While hе's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that еven you
Can't get under my skin if I don't let you in
You're tellin' it how you see it
Like truth is whatever you decide
Some people will believe it
And some will read in between the lines
You're putting me in the spotlight
But I've been under it all my life
Said all my life
So I'll be tellin' mine (Mine, oh)
While he's on mine
I wish you knew that even you
Can't get under my skin if I don't let you in, oh
I just hope that one day
We both can laugh about it
When it's not in our face
Won't have to dance around it
Don't drive yourself insane
It won't always be this way

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Coincidence =====
(One, two, a-one, two, three, woo)
The second I put my head on your chest
She knew, she's got a real sixth sense
Now her name comes up once, then it comes up twice
And without her even bein' here, she's back in your life
Now she's in the same damn city on the same damn night
And you've lost all your common sense
What a coincidence
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na
Last week, you didn't have any doubts
This week, you're holdin' space for her tongue in your mouth
Now shе's sendin' you some pictures wеarin' less and less
Tryna turn the past into the present tense, huh
Suckin' up to all of your mutual friends
And you've lost all your common sense (You've lost all your common sense)
The way you told me the truth, minus seven percent (Uh, minus seven percent)
What a coincidence, uh
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
What a surprise, your phone just died
Your car drove itself from L.A. to her thighs
Palm Springs looks nice, but who's by your side?
Damn it, she looks kinda like the girl you outgrew
Least that's what you said (That's what you said)
Oh  wow, you just broke up again
Oh, na-na, na-na-na-na (Coincidence)
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na (Coincidence)

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Why =====
You like New York City in the daytime
I like New York City in the nighttime
You say you like sleeping with the air off
I don't, I need it on
You like the light coming through the windows
I sleep late, so I just keep 'em all closed
You ignore the music on the radio
I don't, I sing along
I don't ask for you to change, baby, no, no, no
And you don't ask for me to change
Tell me how we're not alike
But we work so well and we don't even know why
Funny how the stars crossed right
'Cause we work so well and we don't even know why
You can call it fire and ice
We don't even know why, no, no
We don't even know why, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
We like it in the daytime
We like it in the end of time
Cold outside and you're just in a T-shirt
I have cold blood even in a sweater
You start your night sippin' by the Kilo
I don't, I know you know
We don't even know why, no, no (No, no, no)
We like it in the daytime (We don't even know)
We like it in the end of time (We don't even know)
(We don't even know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know)
Somehow, we end up on the same side
And you wouldn't think that we'd be alright
Even our eyes are different colors, but we see fine
Somehow, we end up on the same side (Up on the same side)
(Think that we'd be alright)
(Oh) Tell me how we're not alike
('Cause we work so well and we don't even know why, why)
(But we don't even know why)
We like it in the daytime (Oh)
We like it in the end of time (We don't even know why)
We like it in the nighttime

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Read your Mind =====
Ah
Made it clear when you told me (Ah-ah)
Don't know why, but you gotta be lonely (Ah-ah-ah)
Say it's hard, but you make it look easy (Ah-ah)
So I'm tryin' to live in reality (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Decompressin', tryna ease the tension, but you
Got me stressin', feelin' like I need to call when
You sneak up on me, tell me that you miss me in your life
I can't read your mind
You say that you need to be alone
But night and day, want me at your beck and call
You say you know that you might be crossin' a line
Wastin' all our time
To think that we could be casual
You're not my friend and, baby, you never were
Why the fuss if you say you just wanna be mine?
Tell me, what's gonna happen
When it's you and me in a room, but you know you can't have it?
Oh, I'll be laughin'
When you say that you really have changed
Finally found your way
'Cause I'm close to your face (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Double-checkin', did I get the message in the way
You intended? Got me second-guessin' when you
Sneak up on me, tell me that you need me in your life
You say (Uh) you know (Yeah) that you might be crossin' a line
But night and day, want me at your beck and call (Want me at your beck and call)
Wastin' all our time (Time)
To think (Think) that we could be casual
You're not (Not) my friend (My friend) and, baby, you never were
Why (Why) the fuss (Fuss) if you say you just wanna be mine?
Ha-ah-ah-ah, la, mm-mm

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Sharpest Tool =====
I know you're not
The sharpest tool in the shed
We had sex, I met your best friends
Then a bird flies by and you forget
I don't hear a word
'Til your guilt creeps in
On a Tuesday, send a soft "hey"
As if you really don't recall the time
We were goin' right, then you took a left
Left me with a lot of shit to second-guess
Guess I'll waste another year on wonderin' if
If that was casual, then I'm an idiot
I'm lookin' for an answer in-between the lines
Lyin' to yourself if you think we'rе fine
You're confused and I'm upsеt, but
We never talk about it
All the silence just makes it worse, really
'Cause it leaves you so top-of-mind for me
All the silence is just your strategy
We never talk about how you
Found God at your ex's house, always
Made sure that the phone was face-down
Seems like overnight, I'm just the bitch you hate now
We never talk it through
How you guilt-tripped me to open up to you
Then you logged out, leavin' me dumbfounded, oh-oh
Lyin' to yourself if you think we're fine
You're confused and I'm upset, but
We never talk about it (We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it)
We never talk about it (We don't talk about it, talk, talk, talk about it)
(We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it)
We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it (We never talk about it)
We don't talk about it, talk, talk, talk about it (We never talk about it)
We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it

===== Sabrina Carpenter - emails i can’t send =====
It's times like these, wish I had a time machine
So I could see what you did October 13th
At 10:15, were you really asleep?
Were you lyin' to me and the family?
There's no "us" in us when I'm lackin' trust
You wanna discuss, ugh, you disgust me
Don't make me cuss you out, why'd you let me down?
Don't say sorry now
And thanks to you, I, I can't love right
I get nice guys and villainize them
Read their texts like they're havin' sex right now
Scared I'll find out that it's true
And if I do, then I blame you
For every worst that I assume
When I'm forty-five, someone calls me their wife
And he fucks our lives in one selfish night
Don't think I'll find forgiveness as fast as mom did
And God, I love you, but you're such a dipshit
Please fuckin' fix this
'Cause you were all I looked up to
Now I can't even look at you
(You too)
I mean, as they say in Chicago
"He had it comin'"

===== Sabrina Carpenter - A Nonsense Christmas =====
It's the holiday remix
Ah-ah
Think I only want you under my mistletoe
I might change your contact to "Has a Huge North Pole"
You said you like my stockings better on the floor
Boy, I've been a bad girl, I guess I'm gettin' coal, no
Let me come warm you up, you been out in the snow
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like, "Ho, ho, ho"
I don't want Santa's elves underneath this ol' tree
Here's a lil' carol I wrote, it's about you and me (Me)
You're my wish list
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' Christmas
Snowflakes in my stomach when we're kissin'
And when you're comin' down the chimney
Oh, it feels so good
I need that Charles Dickens
You'll be Santa Claus and I'll be Mrs. 
I'll take you for a ride, I'll be your Vixen
I don't even know, I'm talkin' Christmas
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'm talkin' deckin' all the halls
I'm talkin' spikin' eggnog
I'm talkin' opposite of small
I'm talkin' big snowballs
You got a new toy for me
I'm out here trimmin' the tree
I caught that holiday glee
My true love gave it to me
Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like, "Ho, ho, ho, ho"
And I don't want Santa's elves (Don't want) underneath this ol' tree (Tree)
Here's a lil' carol I wrote (Yeah), it's about you and me
You're my wish list (Wish list)
Lookin' at you got me thinkin' Christmas (Christmas)
Snowflakes in my stomach when we're kissin' (When we're kissin')
I need that Charles Dickens (No)
You'll be Santa Claus and I'll be Mrs. (Mrs., uh)
I don't even know, I'm talkin' Christmas (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm talkin' (Talkin'), I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Talkin')
I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (Na-na-na), I'm talkin'
(Blah-blah, blah-blah)
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah (Ah-ah)
I'm talkin' chestnuts (Talkin')
I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
Look at all those presents, that's a big sack
Boy, that package is too big to gift wrap
Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a Christ-smash
How quickly can you build a snowman? Think fast
Oh

===== Sabrina Carpenter - Slim Pickins =====
Guess I'll end this life alone
I am not dramatic
These are just the thoughts that pass right through me
All the douchebags in my phone
Play 'em like a slot machine
If they're winnin', I'm just losin'
A boy who's jacked and kind
Can't find his ass to save my life
Oh, it's slim pickings
If I can't have the one I love
I guess it's you that I'll be kissin'
Just to get my fixings
Since the good ones are deceased or taken
I'll just keep on moanin' and bitchin'
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Jesus, what's a girl to do?
This boy doesn't even know
The difference between "there," "their" and "they are"
Yet he's naked in my room
Missin' all the things he's missin'
God knows that he isn't livin' large
A boy who's nice that breathes
I swear he's nowhere to be seen
It's slim pickings
Moanin' and bitchin'
Since the good ones call their exes wasted
And since the Lord forgot my gay awakenin'
Then I'll just be here in the kitchen
Servin' up some moanin' and bitchin'

===== Chappell Roan - Good Luck, Babe! =====
It's fine, it's cool
You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth
And guess I'm the fool
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof
I don't wanna call it off
But you don't wanna call it love
You only wanna be the one that I call "baby"
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, 'nother stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
I'm cliché, who cares?
It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
And I cry, it's not fair
I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air
Think I'm gonna call it off
Even if you call it love
I just wanna love someone who calls me "baby"
Ah, ah-yeah, oh
When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife
And when you think about me all of those years ago
You're standing face to face with "I told you so"
You know I hate to say, I told you so
You know I hate to say, but I told you so
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling (Well, I told you so)

===== Chappell Roan - HOT TO GO! =====
Five, six
Five, six, seven, eight
I could be the one, or your new addiction
It's all in my head, but I want non-fiction
I don't want the world, but I'll take this city
Who can blame a girl? Call me hot, not pretty
Baby, do you like this beat?
I made it so you'd dance with me
It's like a hundred ninety-nine degrees
When you're doin' it with me, doin' it with me
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
Snap and clap and touch your toes
Raise your hands, now body roll
Dance it out, you're hot to go
You can take me hot to go
Well, I woke up alone starin' at my cеilin'
I try not to care, but it hurts my feelings
You don't have to stare, comе here, get with it
No one's touched me there in a damn hot minute
And baby, don't you like this beat?
I made it so you'd sleep with me
What's it take to get your number?
What's it take to bring you home?
Hurry up, it's time for supper
Order up, I'm hot to go
Hurry up, it's gettin' cold
You can take me hot to go (Oh, yeah)
You can take me hot to go (Hot to go)
Whew, it's hot in here
Is anyone else hot?
Woo, you comin' home with me?
Okay, it's hot
I'll call the cab

===== Chappell Roan - Pink Pony Club =====
I know you wanted me to stay
But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in L.A. 
And I heard that there's a special place
Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day
I'm having wicked dreams of leaving Tennessee
Hear Santa Monica, I swear it's calling me
Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream
"God, what have you done?
You're a pink pony girl, and you dance at the club," oh mama
I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels, it's where I belong, down at the
Pink Pony Club, I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Hollywood, I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club
I'm up and jaws are on the floor
Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door
Black lights and a mirrored disco ball
Every night's another reason why I left it all
I thank my wicked dreams, a year from Tennessee
Oh, Santa Monica, you've been too good to me
Don't think I've left you all behind
Still love you and Tennessee, you're always on my mind
And mama, every Saturday
I can hear your Southern drawl a thousand miles away, saying
I'm gonna keep on dancing

===== Chappell Roan - Red Wine Supernova =====
She was a playboy, Brigitte Bardot
She showed me things I didn't know
She did it right there out on the deck
Put her canine teeth in the side of my neck
I'm in the hallway waitin' for ya
Mini skirt and my go-go boots (Uh-Uh)
I just want you to make a move
So slow down, sit down, it's new
I just wanna get to know ya
Guess I didn't quite think it through (Nah-uh, girl)
Fell in love with the thought of you
Now I'm choked up, face down, burnt out
Baby, why don't you come over?
Red wine supernova, falling into me
(Let's pick it up now)
I don't care that you're a stoner
Red wine supernova, fall right into me
I like (I like)
What you like (What you like)
Long hair (No bra)
It's my type (That's right)
You just told me
Want me to fuck you
Baby, I will 'cause I really want to
(Okay, y'all, let's pick it up now)
Well, back at my house
I've got a California king
Okay, maybe it's a twin bed
And some roommates (Don't worry, we're cool)
I heard you like magic
I've got a wand and a rabbit
So baby, let's get freaky, get kinky
Let's make this bed get squeaky

===== Chappell Roan - Casual =====
My friends call me a loser
'Cause I'm still hanging around
I've heard so many rumors
That I'm just a girl that you bang on your couch
I thought you thought of me better
Someone you couldn't lose
You said, "We're not together"
So now when we kiss, I have anger issues
You said, "Baby, no attachment"
But we're
Knee-deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out
Is it casual now?
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her house in Long Beach
I know what you tell your friends
It's casual, if it's casual now
Then baby, get me off again
If it's casual, it's casual now
Dumb love, I love being stupid
Dream of us in a year
Maybe we'd have an apartment
And you'd show me off to your friends at the pier
I know, "Baby, no attachment"
If it's casual, oh, oh, oh
It's hard being casual
When my favorite bra lives in your dresser
And it's hard being casual
When I'm on the phone talking down your sister
And I try to be the chill girl that
Holds her tongue and gives you space
I try to be the chill girl but
Honestly, I'm not
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her Long Beach house
Baby, get me off again
I fucked you in the bathroom when we went to dinner
Your parents at the table, you wonder why I'm bitter
Bragging to your friends I get off when you hit it
I hate to tell the truth, but I'm sorry, dude, you didn't
I hate that I let this drag on so long, now I hate myself
Hate that I let this drag on so long, you can go to hell

===== Chappell Roan - Femininomenon =====
Same old story, time again
Got so close but then you lost it
Should've listened to your friends
'Bout his girlfriend back in Boston
You sent him pictures and playlists and phone sex
He disappeared from the second that you said
"Let's get coffee, let's meet up"
I'm so sick of online love
And I don't understand
Why can't any man
Hit it like, get it hot
Make a bitch, it's a fem
Make a bitch, it's a—
Um, can you play a song with a fucking beat?
(Hit it like) Hit it like rom-pom-pom-pom
(Get it hot) Get it hot like Papa John
(Make a bitch) Make a bitch go on and on
(It's a fem) It's a femininomenon
So let's say it's working out
You pretend to love his mother
Lying to your friends about
How he's such a goddamn good lover
Stuck in the suburbs, you're folding his laundry
Got what you wanted, so stop feeling sorry
Crying at the nail salon
Dude, can you play a song with a fucking beat?
Ladies, you know what I mean
And you know what you need
And so does he
But does it happen? (No)
Well, what we really need is a femininomenon
(A what?) A femininomenon
Did you hear me? Play the fucking beat
Hit it like rom-pom-pom-pom
Make a bitch, it's a fem (It's a femininomenon)
Make a bitch, it's a fem, fem, fem, fem

===== Chappell Roan - My Kink Is Karma =====
We broke up on a Tuesday
Kicked me out with the rent paid
Ruined my credit, stole my cute aesthetic
Who knew that we'd let it
Get this bad when it ended?
It's comical, bridges you burn
If karma's real, hope it's your turn
I heard from Katie
You're losing it lately
Moved back with your parents
And date girls who are eighteen
It's hot when you have a meltdown
In the front of your house and you're getting kicked out
It's hot when you're drinking downtown
And you're getting called out 'cause you're running your mouth
Oh, God
And it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around
Oh, God, oh, God
People say I'm jealous, but my kink is watching
You ruin your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous, but my kink is karma
Wishing you the best, in the worst way
Using your distress as foreplay
Six months since April and I'm doing better
No need to be hateful in your fake Gucci sweater
But it's hot when you have a meltdown
It's hot when you're going through hell
And you're hating yourself, I'm feeling myself
It's hot when you know that you're caught
And you're getting pissed off, it's getting me off
It's hot, it's hot

===== Chappell Roan - Naked In Manhattan =====
Hi, it's Chappell, I know you just landed
And I know you're probably busy but
I would love to see you
So, call me when you can
New crush, high school love again
The rush of slumber party kissing
Don't touch, I'll never cross the line
So I pushed you down a million times
I'd love if you knew you were on my mind
Constant like Cicadas in the summertime
Boys suck, and girls I've never tried
And we both know we're getting drunk tonight
Touch me, baby, put your lips on mine
Could go to hell but we'll probably be fine
I know you want it, baby, you can have it
Oh, I've never done it, let's make it cinematic
Like that one sex scene that's in Mulholland Drive
I wanna know, baby, what is it like?
Oh, I've never done it, naked in Manhattan
Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)
A Pisces, who knew that we were so aligned?
When I sing that Lana song, it makes you cry
Mean Girls, we watch it every night
And we both have a crush on Regina George
You love peach and ice cream
Bedazzled, Chanel rings
In New York, you can try things
An inch away from more than just friends
Hair clips and lip gloss
French kiss, sitting criss-cross
If I don't try, then it's my loss
Won't you fucking touch me?
I just want to touch you (Naked in Manhattan)
I want all of your love (Naked in Manhattan)
Oh, oh, oh (Naked in Manhattan)
Naked in Manhattan

===== Chappell Roan - Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl =====
You know what they say, "Never waste a Friday night on a first date"
But there I was, in my heels with my hair straight
And so, I take him to this bar; this man wouldn't dance
He didn't ask a single question
And he was wearing these fugly jeans (Ew)
It doesn't matter though
He doesn't have what it takes to be
With a girl like me
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Not overdramatic, I know what I want
We're leaving the planet, and you can't come
Uh-huh, I'm through
With all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow
Look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Telling secrets there on the mattress
Wearing nothing but glitter and lashes
At every party, we're the party, shaking our asses
Making out while the world collapses
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me (Shake it for me)
Get up off your feet, get up on that bar
Walk that walk from Tokyo to New York
With everything you feel and everything you are
Walk that walk, flash the camera, flash the camera, flash the camera
You're a star
A super graphic ultra modern, oh, you got me, "La-la-la"-in'
Hyper-sexy top to bottom girl like me

===== Chappell Roan - After Midnight =====
My mama said, "Nothing good happens
When it's late and you're dancing alone"
She's in my head saying, "It's not attractive
Wearing that dress and red lipstick"
This is what I wanted, this is what I like
I've been a good, good girl for a long time
But baby, I like flirting, a lover by my side
Can't be a good, good girl even if I tried
'Cause after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the club lights
I kinda wanna kiss your girlfriend if you don't mind
I love a little drama, let's start a bar fight
'Cause everything good happens after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the moonlight
I kinda wanna kiss your boyfriend if you don't mind
I love a little "uh-huh", let's watch the sunrise
'Cause everything good happens after
I really want your hands on my body
A slow dance, baby, let's get it on
That’s my type of fun, that's my kind of party
Your hands on my body, your hot hands
Baby, put your hands up, be a freak in the club
Yeah, I'll make a move, then we're making out, yeah, we're makin', make love
Yeah, we're makin', make love, be a freak in the club
Be a freak in the club, yeah
After midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the club lights (Club lights)
I kinda wanna kiss your girlfriend if you don't mind (If you don't, if you don't mind)
I love a little drama, let's start a bar fight (Everybody wants to make a little love)
I kinda wanna kiss your boyfriend if you don't mind (If you don't, if you don't mind)

===== Chappell Roan - Picture You =====
Draw the blinds, light every candle
Slip off my pretty dress down my chest when I think of you
Every night, both lips on the mirror
It's ritualistic, counting lipstick stains where you should be
Oh, I need you around
I'm getting close now
Do you picture me like I picture you? (Oh)
Am I in the frame from your point of view? (Oh)
Do you feel the same? I'm too scared to say (Oh)
Half of the things I do when I picture you
So, tell me now (Tell me now) all your perversions (Oh, oh)
Am I doing research in a mini skirt (Am I?) at the library in your hometown?
When I picture you
Aah, aah
Aah
Do you picture me like I picture you?
Am I in the frame from your point of view?
Do you feel the same? I'm too scared to say

===== Chappell Roan - California =====
I stretched myself across four states
New lands, west coast, where my dreams lay
I trade amber clay roads for the
Sea foam and the endless sun rays
'Cause I was never told that I wasn't gonna get
The things I want the most
But people always say, "If it hasn't happened yet
Then maybe you should go"
Come get me out of California
No leaves are brown
I miss the seasons in Missouri
My dying town
Thought I'd be cool in California
I'd make you proud
To think I almost had it going
But I let you down
Too hard to find reasons to stay
Even true love could not persuade
'Cause I was never told that I wasn't gonna get
The things I want the most
And people always say, "If it hasn't happened yet
Come get me out

===== Chappell Roan - Coffee =====
Can't meet you for dinner at the Italian place, it's
Where I met your family, some words were exchanged
I'd suggest the jazz bar on Mary Ann Street, but
You'd buy me a drink and we know where that leads, so
I'll meet you for coffee, 'cause if we have wine
You'll say that you want me, I know that's a lie
If I didn't love you, it would be fine
Meet you for coffee, only for coffee
Nowhere else is safe, every place leads back to your place
You said let's do the park, 'cause I love the park
That may be true, but God forbid it gets dark
Here come the excuses that fuel the illusions
But I'd rather feel something than nothing at all, so
I'll meet you for coffee, 'cause if we have wine
You'll say that you're sorry, I know that's a lie
If I didn't trust you, it would be fine
I'll meet you for coffee, only for coffee
Nowhere else is safe, every place leads back to your
We've done this before
And I don't need it anymore
So let's not do coffee, let's not even try
It's better we leave it and give it some time
'Cause if we do coffee, it's never just coffee
It's never just coffee

===== Chappell Roan - Kaleidoscope =====
Here we go again, everything is fine
I guess we could pretend we didn't cross a line
But ever since that day, everything has changed
The way I write your name, a cursive letter "A"
Whenever it may be that you go on your way
If you really wanna leave, I'll never make you stay
Whatever you decide, I will understand
And it'll all be fine and just go back to being friends
And love is a kaleidoscope; how it works, I'll never know
And even all the change, it's somehow all the same
Turn it to the left and right, colors shinin' in your eye
And even upside down, it's beautiful somehow
It's never just a shape alone, love is a kaleidoscope
And if you ever find someone who could write
A better song for you, well, I'd love to see them try
Put it all in words and sing it all in tune
There's no one else who could, the only one is you
And if you change your mind, I will understand
And it'll just take time to go back to being friends
Every color of the rainbow, don't be afraid to hold it close

===== Chappell Roan - Guilty Pleasure =====
Learned it on the internet
Wheels turning in my head
Think back to what you said
And I turn red, I'm turning red
Wild thoughts that make me melt
A good hit below the belt
Sometimes, I scare myself
But I can't help what I can't help
So shame on me and shame on you
I fantasize what we would do
And how would it taste? And the way you move
Oh, some good girls do bad things too
I want this like a cigarette
Can we drag it out and never quit? And
Oh my god, you are Heaven-sent
With your dirty mind, yeah, you're pervеrted
You give me guilty, guilty plеasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
Feels like pornography
Watching you try on jeans, you're a
Pothead, you're a cinephile
It's been awhile since you turned up the dial
So shame on me (Shame on me) and shame on you (Shame on you)
I fantasize what we would do (What we would do)
Some good girls do bad things too
Can we drag it out and never quit?
And, oh my God, you are Heaven-sent
With your dirty mind, yeah, you're perverted
(Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure!)

===== Chappell Roan - Love Me Anyway =====
I love you because you have those Polaroids of me inside your nightstand
And I love you because you're understanding when I’m too shy to show my skin
Sometimes I forget, wasn't always this way
It's hard to admit, I was the one to blame
When I met you at summer camp
I would never give you the chance
You still la-love me anyway
Autumn came and December went
Turned you down at your high school dance
I love you because when I say "I don’t wanna talk" you always call me
And I love you because you lead me back to bed when I wander in my sleep
And after all this time, you were right
Can we take more Polaroids for you to hide?
Anyway

===== Chappell Roan - The Giver =====
(Two, three)
Ain't got antlers on my walls
But I sure know mating calls
From the stalls in the bars on a Friday night
And other boys may need a map
But I can close my eyes
And have you wrapped around my fingers like that
So, baby
When you need the job done
You can call me, baby
'Cause you ain't got to tell me
It's just in my nature
So take it like a taker
'Cause, baby, I'm a giver
Ain't no need to hurry
'Cause, baby, I deliver
Ain't no country boy quitter
I get the job done
Girl, I don't need no lifted truck
Revvin' loud to pick you up
'Cause how I look is how I touch
And in this strip-mall town of dreams
Good luck finding a man who has the means
To rhinestone cowgirl all night long
If you never had one
Call me, baby, yeah
'Cause you ain't gotta tell me
Na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na (She gets the job done)
Na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (She gets the job done)
Na-na-na
Yes, ma'am, yes, I do
You're welcome

===== Chappell Roan - School Nights =====
I'm feeling childish
When you draw tattoos on my forearm
Pop bubblegum too loud
We got them preachin' that we're hell-bound
But I don't think we are unless you do
I wanna be a kid with you
Talk slow on a school night
And you can disregard my virgin ears and say what you like
You wanna win me over now?
Impress me like a school fight
And I triple-dog dare ya
To pinky-promise that you'll never lie
Ooh ooh oh
We light firecrackers in the middle of the street
You hear them yellin' at us
But you, listen to me
As I pour my voice in your soul
You say "goddamn let's never get old," and
I agree
Make me a ring out of clover flowers
Sit in a teacup, spin for hours
I'm official, I know I'm official
Got a badge to your club and
One has initials
You become King Kong
You're King Kong
You grow up so strong
You're so strong
But I wannna stay young
Yeah, I wanna stay young with you
Yeah, I wanna stay young
Wanna stay young
I wanna stay young with you
I wanna stay young
You want to win me over now?

===== Chappell Roan - Good Hurt =====
I know I'm impatient
Bite your tongue or I'll do it for you
You can taste hesitation
Mouth to mouth conversation
And I've even tried medication
Cold hearted frustration
You can call it foundation
I'll call you when I'm wasted
Oh, I should know better
All I really want is that good hurt
I know in my head I could do better
No one else compares to who I had first
That good hurt
Lied when I said I love you
Didn't mean to say it but I
Know you're not delusional
Guess that I was manipulative
You can call me Medusa
Bite you good but I'll leave you colder
Use me just like I used you
Till it's over
I guess I will lay here while you move
And think it through but I can't help but wish that it was you
On my body, make good hurt stay
I just wanna feel that pain

===== Chappell Roan - Bitter =====
Oh God, tell me that I'm not insane
With a toy gun hanging in my mouth
I'm made of jade and I'm feeling pretty jaded
It's a problem that I'll never ever figure out
Take pills for your double black eyes
Said I pack a punch and give it to ya
Don't promise you'll do better next time
I know never to believe ya
I love being bitter
It makes me feel better
Bitter feels better than tryna get better and I
Yes, I love being bitter
But it makes me feel weathered
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault
I used to laugh like the cartoon children
I wasn't always this way
Once sweet like an orange creamsicle
Or lemon icing on the cake
Bite hard when I try to be nice
I know exactly what you want
Cut clean when I twist that knife
No one falls for the villain
But I love being bitter
Yeah, it makes me feel better
I'm unaware just give me some time, I'm
Having trouble fighting wars in my mind
Take it easy, take it easy
I don't care that I'm on your shelf 'cause
I'm pretty good at talking to myself
Take it easy
'Cause it makes me feel better
Now I'm sick in the head and I think it's my fault

===== Charli xcx - Guess featuring billie eilish =====
Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh
You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about (Yeah)
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious
(Work it out)
Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about
I wanna try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Kiss it, ride it, can I fit it?
Charli likes boys, but she knows I'd hit it
(Knows I'd hit it)
Charli, call me if you're with it
(Yeah) Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
You wanna guess what me and Billie have been textin' about? (We've been disrespectful)
Still tryin' to guess the password to my Google Drive (Are you obsessed with me?)
You wanna guess the address of the party we're at (You know you're not invited)
You wanna guess if we're serious about this song

===== Charli xcx - Boom Clap =====
You're picture-perfect blue
Sunbathing under the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate
First kiss just like a drug
Under your influence
You take me over, you're the magic in my veins
This must be love
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
No silver or no gold
Could dress me up so good
You're the glitter in the darkness of my world
Just tell me what to do
I'll fall right into you
We're going under cast the spell, just say the word
I feel your love!
You are the light and I will follow
You let me lose my shadow
You are the sun, the glowing halo
And you keep burning me up with all your love, oh

===== Charli xcx - 360 =====
I went my own way and I made it
I'm your favorite reference, baby
Call me Gabbriette, you're so inspired
Ah, ah
I'm tectonic, moves, I make 'em
Shock you like defibrillators
No style? I can't relate
I'll always be the one, ah
Drop down, yeah
Put the camera flash on
So stylish
Baby tee is all gone
Lookin' like an icon
Work angles, yeah
Yeah, 360
When you're in the mirror, do you like what you see?
When you're in the mirror, you're just looking at me
I'm everywhere, I'm so Julia
Ah-ah, ah
When you're in the party b-b-bumpin' that beat
666 with a princess streak
Bumpin' that
That city sewer slut's the vibe
Internationally recognized
I set the tone, it's my design
And it's stuck in your mind
Legacy is undebated
You gon' jump if A. G. made it
If you love it, if you hate it
I don't fucking care what you think

===== Charli xcx - Apple =====
I guess the apple don't fall far from the tree
'Cause I've been looking at you so long
Now I only see me
I wanna throw the apple into the sky
Feels like you never understand me
So I just wanna drive
To the airport, the airport
The airport, the airport
I guess the apple could turn yellow or green
I know there's lots of different nuances
To you and to me
I wanna grow the apple, keep all the seeds
But I can't help but get so angry
You don't listen, I leave
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night
I think the apple's rotten right to the core
From all the things passed down
From all the apples coming before
I split the apple down symmetrical lines
And what I find is kinda scary
Makes me just wanna drive
(Drive, drive, drive, dr-dr-dr-drive, drive, drive)
(I'm gonna drive, gonna drive all night)
(Drive, drive, drive, dr-dr-dr-drive, drive)
I wanna know where you go
When you're feeling alone
When you're feeling alone, do you?
(Do you, do you, do you, do you)
(Do you, do you)

===== Charli xcx - Speed Drive =====
Uh-oh
Uh, oh
She my best friend in the whole world
On the mood board, she's the inspo
And she dressed in really cute clothes
Kawaii like we're in Tokyo
Devon Lee smile, teeth a white row
Got a classic, real deep, Van Gogh
She got loyalty, she says, "I love you, girl"
I love her more
Ah-ah, Barbie, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind
Jump into the driver's seat and put it into speed drive
Hot, ridin' through the streets, on a different frequency
Know you know just what I mean, we're runnin' through the red lights
Ah, Barbie, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind
Li-i-i-i, i-i, i-i, i-ights
Red lights, red lights, red lights, red lights, yeah
Oh (Oh), got the top down, tires on fire (On fire)
Who are you? I'm livin' my life (Oh)
See you lookin' with that side eye
Wow, you're so jealous 'cause I'm one of a kind (Oh)
What you think about me, I don't care (I don't care)
I'm a classic, real deep, Voltaire
The girls who need to know
Well, they already know, they're over there

===== Charli xcx - 1999 =====
I just wanna go back, back to 1999
Take a ride to my old neighborhood
I just wanna go back, sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Wanna go back, wanna go
Yeah, I just wanna go back
Nike Airs, All That
CD, old Mercedes
Drive 'round listening to Shady like, oh
Never under pressure, oh
Those days, it was so much better, oh
Feelin' cool in my youth, relaxin'
No money, no problem
It was easy back then
Ooh, wish that we could go back in time, uh
Got memories
Ooh, maybe we could do it tonight
Tonight's the night
I just wanna go back
Sing "Hit me, baby, one more time"
Yeah, I remember back home
Best friends, all night, no phone
No cares, I was dumb and so young
My room singing Michael Jackson (Hee, hee)
Those days it was so much better, oh
Feelin' cool in my youth, I'm askin'
"Does anyone remember how we did it back then?"
Ah, yeah
Back to where we came from
Playin' air guitar on the roof
In the kitchen, up on the table
Like we had a beautiful view
I wanna go
Back to 1999
I know those days are over, but a boy can fantasize
'Bout JTT on MTV and when I close my e-e-eyes
And I'm right there, right there
And he's right there, right there
And we're right there, right there
Ah, ah, ah, I wanna go back
I just wanna go back (Yeah), back to 1999
Back to where we came from (Came from)
Playin' air guitar on the roof (Ah)

Take me back to '99 (Yeah)

===== Charli xcx - Von dutch =====

Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys (XCX)
Head is spinnin' thinkin' 'bout boys
I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night
I want 'em all, I want 'em all
And when they finally leave me, I'm all alone but
I'm lookin' down and my girls are blowin' my phone up
Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at
Didn't hit 'em back
I'm sorry that I missed your party
I wish I had a better excuse like
I had to trash the hotel lobby
But I was busy thinkin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys
In every city I've got one with different ringtones
Flyin' from L.A. all the way to Puerto Rico
My girls are callin' me askin' me where I'm at

I was busy dreamin' 'bout boys (Boys), boys (Oh, baby), boys, yeah

===== Charli xcx - Good Ones =====
I wish you gave me a reason
That you were better at leavin'
That you got your kicks from seein' me low
I always let the good ones go
Don't want the kisses, unless they're bitter
I'm hooked on touches that leave me weaker
I swear that I love nothin' more than broke
And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones, 'causе they're all I know
I always let thе good ones go
I always let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones
Let you down easy, I'm tryin'
'Cause you're everything I've spent my whole life fightin'
So when I walk away, it's not your fault
I want the bad ones 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh, oh)
I let the good ones go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah, yeah)

===== Charli xcx - Girl, so confusing featuring lorde =====
Girl, it's so confusing sometimes to be a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, how do you feel being a girl?
Girl, girl, girl
How do you feel being a girl?
Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Yeah, I don't know if you like me
Sometimes I think you might hate me
Sometimes I think I might hate you
Maybe you just wanna be me
You always say, "Let's go out"
So we go eat at a restaurant
Sometimes it feels a bit awkward
'Cause we don't have much in common
People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
We talk about making music
But I don't know if it's honest
Can't tell if you wanna see me
Falling over and failing
And you can't tell what you're feeling
I think I know how you feel
Well, honestly, I was speechless
When I woke up to your voice note
You told me how you'd been feeling
Let's work it out on the remix
You'd always say, "Let's go out"
But then I'd cancel last minute
I was so lost in my head
And scared to be in your pictures
'Cause for the last couple years
I've been at war with my body
I tried to starve myself thinner
And then I gained all the weight back
I was trapped in the hatred
And your life seemed so awesome
I never thought for a second
My voice was in your head
"Girl, you walk like a bitch"
When I was ten, someone said that
And it's just self-defence
Until you're building a weapon
She believed my projection
And now I totally get it
Forgot that inside the icon
There's still a young girl from Essex
It's you and me on the coin
The industry loves to spend
And when we put this to bed
The internet will go crazy
I'm glad I know how you feel
'Cause I ride for you, Charli (Charli, Charli)
Girl, girl
(It's so confusing)
You know I ride for you, too
(It's so confusing-ing)

===== Charli xcx - Beg for You =====
You know I go insane every time you have to catch a flight (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Well, can I take you to the airport?
Make out under the bathroom lights (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Put your lips on my lips
I'll remember your kiss on the nights when I miss you
Somethin' I can't forget when I'm restless in bed
Yeah, you got me obsessed (Mm)
Oh, don't you leave me this way
Won't you wait another hour or two?
You know I need you to stay
Don't make me beg for you 'cause I'll beg for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah
Beg for you, beg for you (Yeah)
Bеg for you, beg for you, mmm (Yeah)
Beg for you, bеg for you (Yeah; Rina Sawayama)
So don't you leave me this way (Uh, yeah)
You're like an ocean breeze, comin' and goin' just as you please (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Separated by a degree, hesitate and I lose you
So far out of reach
(Ah, ah-ah-ah)
Oh, put your lips on my lips
Yeah, you got me obsessin' now
My heart is achin', my breath you've taken
Oh, babe, I just want a taste
Don't you leave me this way
Don't make me beg for you
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way
This way, this way
Don't leave me, don't leave me this way (Don't you leave me)
This way (Don't you leave me this way), this way (Don't you leave me)
This way (Don't you leave me this way), this way (Don't you leave me) (Yeah)
Don't you leave me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ice cubes on our tongues because we like to keep it freezy
Lavender Lamborghini, get out on the right side
Chauffeur stayed at home because my girl wanted to ride
Lookin' luxe and tastin' plush, I'm feelin' so alive
Want to take it to the highway, come on, let's go for a drive, uh
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
(Let me ride, let me ride)
So let me ride, let me ride
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time
So let's ride

(Vroom, vroom) Those slugs know they can't catch me
(Vroom, vroom) Beep, beep, so let's ride
Bubblegum-pink Ferrari, yeah, I'm so bossy
Speedin' like Alonso just to crash your party
People are goin' loco when I'm pullin' up, takin' your papi
Don't think about consequences 'cause they're never gonna stop me, what?
Boom, boom, boom
Hear me comin' through the radio
Watch me go zoom, zoom, zoom
Try to catch me, but you're too slow
Know they can't catch me
Too slow, too slow

Pour you in a silver cup
You know I like to party
But you know I love your body
So many things I shouldn't do
I hate myself for hurting you (Yeah)
Honestly, I'm reckless

===== Charli xcx - Sympathy is a knife =====
I don't wanna share the space
I don't wanna force a smile
This one girl taps my insecurities
Don't know if it's real or if I'm spiraling
One voice tells me that they laugh
George says I'm just paranoid
Says he just don't see it, he's so naive
I'm embarrassed to have it, but need the sympathy
'Cause I couldn't even be her if I tried
I'm opposite, I'm on the other side
I feel all these feelings I can't control
Oh no, don't know why
All this sympathy is just a knife
Why I can't even grit my teeth and lie?
Oh no, don't know
Why I wanna buy a gun?
Why I wanna shoot myself?
Volatilе at war with my dialogue
I'd say that there was a God if thеy could stop this
Wild voice tearing me apart
I'm so apprehensive now
Don't wanna see her backstage at my boyfriend's show
Fingers crossed behind my back
I hope they break up quick
I feel all these feelings I can't control (Oh no)
Yeah, all this sympathy is just a knife
Oh no, oh no
Why is all this sympathy a fucking knife?
Couldn't even be her if I tried

===== Charli xcx - B2b =====
Back to, back to, back to, back to
Back to, back to, back to, back to you
I don't wanna fall right back to us
Maybe you should run right back to her
I don’t wanna go back, back to
I don't wanna go back, back to
I don’t wanna fall right back to us
Back, back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back, back
Back, back, back, back to
Took a long time
Breaking muscle down
Building muscle up
Repeating it
I don't wanna feel feelings
I, I, I (Ah, ah, ah)
I don't wanna go back, back to (Ah, ah, ah)
Back, back, back, back, back, back (Ah, ah, ah)

===== Charli xcx - After the Afterparty =====
After the afterparty we're gonna keep it goin'
We're gonna rip it up, the neighbors might complain
(XCX, Charli!)
I think it's almost 4 AM but baby I'm still feelin' just fine
Ice all up in a plastic cup and I'ma keep on sippin' all night, yeah
I might've kissed a thousand lips, but maybe that's just all in my mind
Some people never understand the way we live but we're livin' life
Uh huh, hey, uh huh, Monday to Sunday, it's never too late
So everyone say, "We don't wanna stop!"
'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna keep it goin'
'Cause after the afterparty, we're gonna stay 'til mornin'
Then when the time is up, we'll do it all again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're all in love
I'm hangin' on my best friend's couch and my clothes are all on the floor
I got glitter in my underwear like it was Studio 54, yeah
I can't remember why I love it, but I need it baby, clap, bring on the encore
Let's pour another drink, the glasses go *clink*
Yeah, we're always up for one more
'Cause after the afterparty (Afterparty)
We're gonna stay 'til mornin' (Stay 'til mornin')
Then when the time is up, we'll do it again (Oh yeah, oh, Lil Boat!)
The party just ended but I'm not done with you
But my folks are out of town, we got a crib with a view
Y'all come over, bring a couple friends, I keep mine with me
Shouts out to Whitney, she was so wicked
The party was so crazy, oh
Tomorrow I'll be lazy
But I'll spend it with you baby
Monday to Sunday, doin' it our way
RiRi on replay, cheers to the weekday
We're all in, we're all in love, yeah
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
And we do it like ice cream for dinner
Bucket of liquor, we're getting sicker
Don't need Ibiza
And we do it like
Then when the time is up, we'll do it again (Oh yeah, oh)
(Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
We're all in love (Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Monday to Sunday doing it our way
(We're all in love!)

===== Billy Joel - Uptown Girl =====
Uptown girl
She's been living in her uptown world
I bet she's never had a backstreet guy
I bet her momma never told her why
I'm gonna try for an
She's been living in her white-bred world
As long as anyone with hot blood can
And now, she's looking for a downtown man
That's what I am
And when she knows what she wants from her time
And when she wakes up and makes up her mind
She'll see I'm not so tough
Just because I'm in love with an
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
She's getting tired of her high class toys
And all the presents from her uptown boys
She's got a choice
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
But maybe, someday, when my ship comes in
She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
And then I'll win
And when she's walking, she's looking so fine
And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine
She'll say I'm not so tough
Uptown girl, she's my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl
You know I'm in love with an uptown girl

===== Billy Joel - Piano Man =====
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes"
La, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da da-dum
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me"
As the smile ran away from his face
"Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place"
Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the navy
And probably will be for life
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"

===== Billy Joel - Vienna =====
Slow down, you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart
Tell me why are you still so afraid? Mm
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You'd better cool it off before you burn it out
You've got so much to do
And only so many hours in a day, hey
But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, ooh
When will you realize Vienna waits for you?
Slow down, you're doin' fine
You can't be everything you wanna be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight
Too bad, but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself, that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong
You know you can't always see when you're right
You're right
You've got your passion, you've got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true, ooh
And take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while
It's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two, ooh
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you could just get old
Why don't you realize Vienna waits for you?

===== Billy Joel - She's Always a Woman =====
She can kill with a smile
She can wound with her eyes
And she can ruin your faith with her casual lies
And she only reveals
What she wants you to see
She hides like a child
But she's always a woman to me
She can lead you to love
She can take you or leave you
She can ask for the truth
But she'll never believe you
And she'll take what you give her
As long as it's free
Yeah, she steals like a thief
Oh, she takes care of herself
She can wait if she wants
She's ahead of her time
Oh, and she never gives out
And she never gives in
She just changes her mind
And she'll promise you more
Than the Garden of Eden
Then she'll carelessly cut you
And laugh while you're bleedin'
But she'll bring out the best
And the worst you can be
Blame it all on yourself
Cause she's always a woman to me
Mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mm
She is frequently kind
And she's suddenly cruel
She can do as she pleases
She's nobody's fool
But she can't be convicted
She's earned her degree
And the most she will do
Is throw shadows at you
Mmm mm, mmm mm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

===== Billy Joel - Just the Way You Are =====
Don't go changing to try and please me
You never let me down before, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
And don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore
I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I take you just the way you are
Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care
I don't want clever conversation
Never want to work that hard, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
I just want someone that I can talk to
I want you just the way you are
Need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
Ah, what will it take 'til you believe in me
The way that I believe in you?
I said, “I love you,” that's forever
And this, I promise from the heart, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
I couldn't love you any better
I love you just the way you are
All right
I never want to work that hard, mm, mm-hm, mm-hmm
I want you just the way you are, oh-oh

===== Billy Joel - My Life =====
Mmm, yeah
Alright
Ooh
Got a call from an old friend, we used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed his shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.​
I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
(I never said you had to...)
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
(I never said...)
I still belong (Still belong)
Don't get me wrong (Get me wrong)
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time
They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
Ah, but sooner or later, you sleep in your own space
Either way, it's okay, you wake up with yourself
(Of circumstance...)
Keep it to yourself, it's my life

===== Billy Joel - It's Still Rock and Roll to Me =====
What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy 'til you spend a lot of money
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of whitewall tires?
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
'Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town but you can't get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
Alright Richie!
Woo!
Ooh
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much
Don't you know about the new fashion, honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money
It's the next phase, new wave
Dance craze, anyways

===== Billy Joel - Only the Good Die Young =====
Come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aww, but sooner or later, it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
Aww, but they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done
Well, only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
You mighta heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
Aww, but that never hurt no one
So come on, Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line
The stained glass curtain you're hidin' behind
Never lets in the sun
Darlin', only the good die young
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
I tell ya, only the good die young
You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
Mmm, and a cross of gold
But Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary
Oh woah woah
And they say there's a heaven for those who will wait
And some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun
You know that only the good die young
Oh-oh-ho, baby
You said your mother told you, "All that I could give you was a reputation"
Aww, she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?
Well, come out, come out, come out, Virginia, don't let me wait
But sooner or later, it comes down to fate
Tell you, baby
Only the good
Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-ooh-hoo, hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo

===== Billy Joel - Movin' Out (Anthony's Song) =====
Hoo-ooh
Ohh-ohh
Mmm-mmm
Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said, "Sonny, move out to the country"
Ah but workin' too hard can give you a heart attack
Ack-ack-ack-ack-ack
You oughta know by now
(You oughta know by now)
Who needs a house out in Hackensack
Is that all you get for your money?
And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out, mmm mm
Ooh-ooh, uh-huh, mmm
Sergeant O'Leary is walkin' the beat
At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mr. Cacciatore's
Down on Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Yeah, and he's tradin' in his Chevy
For a Cadillac-ac-ac-ac-ac-ac
And if he can't drive with a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders
Mmm, I'm movin' out
Oh-ohh, ooh ooh, uh-huh, mmm
You should never argue
With a crazy mind-mind-mind-mind-mind-mind
You can pay Uncle Sam with the overtime
And if that's what you have in mind
Yeah, if that's what you're all about
Good luck movin' up, 'cause I'm movin' out
I'm movin' out

===== Billy Joel - The Longest Time =====
Dum dum dum
Woah, oh, oh, oh (For the longest)
For the longest time
Woah, oh, oh (For the longest)
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do?
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right and I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far, and it's more than I hoped for
Who knows how much further we'll go on?
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself, "Hold on to your heart"
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far, and it's more than I hoped for
I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time
Woah, oh, oh...

===== Billy Joel - The River of Dreams =====
In the middle of the, I go walking in the
In the middle of the night (Middle of the night)
I go walking in my sleep (I go walking in my sleep)
From the mountains of faith (Mountains of faith)
To the river so deep (River so deep)
I must be looking for something (Looking for something)
Something sacred I lost (Sacred I lost)
But the river is wide (Oh, it's wide)
And it's too hard to cross (Too hard to cross)
Even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and stand on the shore
I try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find what I've been looking for
Through the valley of fear (Valley of fear)
To a river so deep (River so deep)
I've been searching for something (Searching for something)
Taken out of my soul (Taken out of my soul)
Something I'd never lose (Never lose)
Something somebody stole (Something somebody stole)
I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
Hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is I've been looking for
Through the jungle of doubt (Jungle of doubt)
I know I'm searching for something (Searching for something)
Something so undefined (So undefined)
And it can only be seen (Only be seen)
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night
I go walking in the, in the middle of the
Not sure about life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by fire, I wade
Into the river that is running through the promised land
Through the desert of truth (Desert of truth)
We all end in the ocean (End in the ocean)
We all start in the streams (Start in the stream)
We're all carried along (Carried along)
By the river of dreams
I go walking in the, in the middle of the (River so deep)
I go walking in the, in the middle of the (Gloria)
I go walking in the, in the middle of the (I go walking in my sleep)
I go walking in the, in the middle of the (It's not Sherie)

===== Billy Joel - You May Be Right =====
Friday night, I crashed your party
Saturday, I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change
I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford-Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane
You may be right
I may be crazy
Oh, but it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
Turn out the lights
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right
Well remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said, take me as I am
Cause you might enjoy
Some madness for a while
Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way
Ho, but it just may be a lunatic
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me
Hey, but it just may be a lunatic
Aww, don't try to save me
You may be wrong

===== Billy Joel - Honesty =====
If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give
"Honesty" is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you
I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe
I can find a lover, I can find a friend
I can have security until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know, I know, I know
When I'm deep inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn?
'Cause you're the one that I depend upon

===== Billy Joel - New York State of Mind =====
Some folks like to get away
Take a holiday from the neighborhood
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood
But I'm taking a Greyhound
On the Hudson River line
I'm in a New York state of mind
(Mmh-mmh)
I've seen all the movie stars
In their fancy cars and their limousines
Been high in the Rockies
Under the evergreens
I know what I'm needing
And I don't want to waste more time
It was so easy living day by day
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues
But now I need a little give and take
The New York Times, the Daily News
It comes down to reality
And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide
I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside
I don't have any reasons, I left them all behind
(Mmh-mmh, oh yeah)
(Who-oh, uh-oh-uh-oh)
I don't have any reasons I left them all behind
I'm just taking a Greyhound
'Cause I'm in a, I'm in a New York
State of mind, yeah

===== Billy Joel - Scenes from an Italian Restaurant =====
A bottle of white, a bottle of red
Perhaps a bottle of Rosé instead
We'll get a table near the street
In our old familiar place
You and I, face to face – mmm
A bottle of red, a bottle of white
It all depends upon your appetite
I'll meet you anytime you want
In our Italian restaurant
Things are okay with me these days
Got a good job, I got a good office
I got a new wife, got a new life
And the family is fine
Oh, we lost touch long ago
You lost weight, I did not know
You could ever look so nice after so much time
Do you remember those days hanging out at the Village Green?
Engineer boots, leather jackets and tight blue jeans
Oh, you'd drop a dime in the box, play a song about New Orleans
Cold beer, hot lights
My sweet romantic teenage nights
(Ooh, ooh...)
(Yeah, yeah yeah!)
(Ooh... oh, oh...)
(Oh, oh, oh...)
Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies
And the King and the Queen at the prom
Riding around with the car top down and the radio on
Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner
We never knew we could want more than that out of life
Surely, Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive
Ohh, ohh, ohhh-oh
Brenda and Eddie were still goin' steady in the summer of '75
When they decided the marriage should be at the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
“Brenda, you know that you're much too lazy
And Eddie could never afford to live that kind of life”
Oh, but there we were, waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye
Ohh, ohh, ohh...
Well, they got an apartment with deep pile carpets
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they bought with the bread
They had saved for a couple of years
They started to fight when the money got tight
And they just didn't count on the tears
Ohh, ohh...
Yeah, rock and roll!
Well, they lived for a while in a very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce, as a matter, of course
And they parted, the closest of friends
Then the king and the queen went back to the green
But you can never go back there again
No, ohh...
Brenda and Eddie had it already by the summer of '75
From the high to the low to the end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to the Greasers
The best they could do was pick up their pieces
We always knew they would both find a way to get by
Ohh, and that's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more, 'cause I told you already
And here we are waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye
Oh, yeahh, yeahh, yeah...!
Bottle of red
Ooh, a bottle of white
Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight

===== Billy Joel - Tell Her About It =====
Listen boy I don't want to see you let a good thing slip away
You know I don't like watching anybody make the same mistakes I made
She's a real nice girl and she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do
Oh, listen boy I'm sure that you think you got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you the way to stay in someone's soul
You're a big boy now and you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know
Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means
Listen boy it's not automatically a certain guarantee
To ensure yourself you've got to provide communication constantly
When you love someone, you're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure
Tell her about it, let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you, tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it, every day before you leave
Pay her some attention, give her something to believe
Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone?
Listen boy it's good information from a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you could be the difference that it makes
She's a trusting soul, she's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you what you should do
Tell her about it, tell her how you feel right now
Just tell her about it, the girl don't want to wait too long
You got to tell her about it, tell her now and you won't go wrong
You got to tell her about it, before it gets too late
You've got to tell her about it
You know the girl don't want to wait
You got to tell her about it
You got to tell, tell, tell her about it
Now, tell her about it

===== Billy Joel - Zanzibar =====
Ali dances and the audience applauds
Though he's bathed in sweat, he hasn't lost his style
Ali, don't you go downtown
You gave away another round for free, woah
Me, I'm just another face at Zanzibar
But the waitress always serves a secret smile, woah
She's waiting out in Shantytown
She's gonna pull the curtains down for me
For me
I've got the old man's car
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zanzibar
Tonight, that's where I'll be
I'll be
Rose, he knows he's such a credit to the game
But the Yankees grab the headlines every time
Melodrama's so much fun
In black and white for everyone to see, woah
Me, I'm trying just to get to second base
And I'd steal it if she only gave the sign, woah
She's gonna give the go ahead
The inning isn't over yet for me
Tonight, that's where I'll be, I'll be
Tell the waitress I'll come back to Zanzibar
I'll be hiding in the darkness with my beer, woah

===== Billy Joel - The Downeaster 'Alexa' =====
Well I'm on the downeaster "Alexa"
And I'm cruising through Block Island Sound
I have charted a course to the Vineyard
But tonight I am Nantucket bound
We took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday
Left this morning from the bell in Gardiner's Bay
Like all the locals here I've had to sell my home
Too proud to leave, I work my fingers to the bone
So I could own my downeaster "Alexa"
And I go where the ocean is deep
There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain can't fall asleep
I got bills to pay and children who need clothes
I know there's fish out there, but where God only knows
They say these waters aren't what they used to be
But I got people back on land who count on me
So if you see my downeaster "Alexa"
And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis
And I still have my hands on the wheel
Yay-o
Yay-yay-o
Now I drive my downeaster "Alexa"
More and more miles from shore every year
Since they told me I can't sell no stripers
And there's no luck in swordfishing here
I was a bayman like my father was before
Can't make a living as a bayman anymore
There ain't much future for a man who works the sea
But there ain't no island left for islanders like me
Yay-yay-yay-o

===== Billy Joel - Big Shot =====
Well, you went uptown
Ridin' in your limousine
With your fine Park Avenue clothes
You had the Dom Perignon
In your hand
And the spoon up your nose
Ooh, and when you
Wake up in the mornin'
With your head on fire
And your eyes too bloody to see
Go on and cry in your coffee
But don't come bitchin' to me
Because you had to be
A big shot, didn't cha
You had to open up your mouth
You had to be a big shot, didn't cha
All your friends were so knocked out
You had to have the last word, last night
You know what everything's about
You had to have a white hot spotlight
You had to be a big shot last night, whoa
Yeah
And they were all impressed
With your Halston dress
And the people that you knew at Elaine's
And the story of your latest success
You kept 'em so entertained
But now you just don't
Remember all the things you said
And you're not sure that you want to know
I'll give you one hint, honey
You sure did put on a show
Yes, yes, you had to be
You had to prove it to the crowd
You're so much fun to be around
You had to have the front page, bold type
You had to be a big shot last night
Well, it's no big sin
To stick your two cents in
If you know when to leave it alone
But you went over the line
You couldn't see it was time to go home
No, no, no, no, no, no
Big shot
Oh, big shot

===== Rihanna - We Found Love =====
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standin' side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feelin', I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
But I've gotta let it go-ooh-oh

===== Rihanna - Love On The Brain =====
And you got me like, oh
What you want from me? (What you want from me?)
And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high
Baby, you got me like, oh, mmm
You love when I fall apart (Fall apart)
So you can put me together and throw me against the wall
Baby, you got me like, I, woo, I
Don't you stop loving me (Loving me)
Don't quit loving me (Loving me)
Just start loving me, oh (Loving me)
And, babe, I'm fist-fighting with fire
Just to get close to you
Can we burn something, babe?
And I'll run for miles just to get a taste
Must be love on the brain
That's got me feeling this way (Feeling this way)
It beats me black and blue, but it fucks me so good
And I can't get enough
Must be love on the brain, yeah
And it keeps cursing my name (Cursing my name)
No matter what I do, I'm no good without you
Baby, keep loving me
Just love me, yeah
Just love me
All you need to do is love me, yeah
Got me like, ow
I'm tired of being played like a violin
What do I gotta do to get in your motherfuckin' heart?
Baby, like, I, woo I
Just start loving me, ooh (Loving me)

===== Rihanna - Diamonds =====
Shine bright like a diamond
Find light in the beautiful sea, I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see, a vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight, I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
So shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful, like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
Shine bright like a diamond (Woah)
Shinin' bright like a diamond
Palms rise to the universe as we moonshine and Molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
Woah-oh, yeah

===== Rihanna - Stay =====
All along, it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"
'Round and around and around and around, we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
And I want you to stay
Ooh
The reason I hold on
'Cause I need this hole gone
Well, funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving
Stay

===== Rihanna - Only Girl (In The World) =====
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la (Uh, yeah)
I want you to love me

Be thinking of me (Uh)
Doing what you like (Haha)
So, boy, forget about the world
'Cause it's gon' be me and you tonight (Yeah)
I wanna make you beg for it

Want you to make me feel

Only girl in the world

'Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man, yeah
Only one
Want you to take it (Uh)
Like a thief in the night (Uh)
Hold me like a pillow
Make me feel right (Uh)
Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keeping
You can come inside (Yeah)
And when you enter, you ain't leaving
Be my prisoner for the night, oh
Take me for a ride, ride
Oh, baby, take me high, high
Let me make you rise, rise
Oh, make it last all night, night
Make it last all night
How to make you feel like a man
Girl in the world

===== Rihanna - S&M =====
Na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na, come on, come on, come on
Na-na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na-na
Feels so good being bad (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's no way I'm turning back (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now the pain is my pleasure 'cause nothing could measure
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Love is great, love is fine (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out the box, outta line (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it (Na-na-na)
S-S-S and M-M-M
Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah-ah-ah"

===== Rihanna - FourFiveSeconds =====
I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz
Yeah, I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that’s all I want
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now, I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See, they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See, all of my kindness (Mhm)
Four, five seconds from wildin'
Just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
'Cause that's all I want

===== Rihanna - Don't Stop The Music =====
Please don't stop the music (Music, music, music, music)

Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew that you'd be up in here lookin' like you do?
You're making stayin' over here impossible
Baby, I'ma say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't
Do you know what you started? I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist, just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now, we're face to face

Please don't stop the, please don't stop the, please don't stop the music
Baby, are you ready? 'Cause it's gettin' close
Don't you feel the passion ready to explode?
What goes on between us, no one has to know
This is a private show, oh
Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa
Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa (Please don't stop the music)
